    "abstract": "Strong-field-driven electric currents in condensed-matter systems open new frontiers in manipulating electronic and optical properties on petahertz frequency scales. In this regime, new challenges arise as the role of the band structure and the quantum nature of ultrafast electron-hole dynamics have yet to be resolved. While petahertz spectroscopy and control of condensed-matter systems holds great potential, revealing the underlying attosecond (1 attosecond – 10(-18) second) dynamics of electrons in solids is still in its infancy. The proposed research aims at the development of a state-of-the-art attosecond metrology scheme that integrates the concept of holography with attosecond gating. Attosecond-gated holography will provide direct insight into the instantaneous evolution of the complex quantum wavefunctions in solid-state systems. This scheme will enable us to follow the electron-hole wavepacket evolution during ultrafast band structure deformation, probing a range of fundamental processes – from sub-cycle phase transitions to ultrafast dynamics in correlated systems. In ATTO-GRAM, we will establish attosecond-gated holography and then apply it to study field-induced transient band structures, resolve electron-hole dynamics during lattice deformation and reveal attosecond phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Integrating state-of-the-art experimental schemes, supported by advanced theoretical analysis, will lead to the discoveries of new phenomena previously deemed inaccessible. The impact of the proposed research reaches beyond attosecond metrology – opening new routes in the establishment of compact solid-state extreme ultraviolet sources, petahertz electronics and optically induced metamaterials.",

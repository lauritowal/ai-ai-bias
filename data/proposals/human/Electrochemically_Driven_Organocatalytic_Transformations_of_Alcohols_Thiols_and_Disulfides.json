    "title": "Electrochemically Driven Organocatalytic Transformations of Alcohols, Thiols and Disulfides",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this research, set in the context of synthetic organic chemistry, is to develop unprecedented methods for electrochemically driven cleavage and subsequent functionalization of C–O and C–S bonds in alcohols, thiols and disulfides using organocatalysts based on phosphorus and sulfur. These radical methods will serve as keys to unlock the potential of the targeted compound classes as feedstocks for synthesis of functional organic compounds, e.g., pharmaceuticals, as well as for biomass valorization processes. Due to the complexity of the targeted transformations, the scarcity of available methods and the novelty of the outlined approach, the research will expand the synthetic toolbox, enable new retrosynthetic disconnections and late-stage (de)functionalization of, e.g., carbohydrates and peptides. Combined with the integrated mechanistic studies, the research will have a significant impact from a fundamental science perspective, as well as enable new synthetic applications. The project is divided into two main topics, each sized for one PhD student and one postdoc working together on the outlined work packages. The proposed research is supported by preliminary results that indicate its viability.",

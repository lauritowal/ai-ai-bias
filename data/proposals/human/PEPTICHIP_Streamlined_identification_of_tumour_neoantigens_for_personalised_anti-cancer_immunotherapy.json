    "title": "PEPTICHIP: Streamlined identification of tumour neoantigens for personalised anti-cancer immunotherapy",
    "abstract": "Immunotherapeutic strategies have emerged as powerful tools to treat many types of cancers. However, the majority of patients still fails to respond to immunotherapies as targetable tumour characteristics vary from patient to patient. Thus, a greater degree of personalisation is required to fine-tune immunotherapies to the specific vulnerabilities of each patientâ€™s tumour. While therapies that target tumour-specific antigens (neoantigens) invoke a strong and specific anti-tumour immune response, we are currently unable to accurately identify patient-specific neoantigens. Current neoantigen identification and purification methods either require impractically large quantities of tumour material or are laborious, expensive, time-consuming (weeks or months) and inaccurate. As part of ERC project PEPTICRAD (2016-2021), Prof. Vincenzo Cerullo at the University of Helsinki has developed a novel microfluidic chip-based device (PeptiCHIP) which condenses the neoantigen purification steps into a single chip capable of accurately analysing minute quantities of human tumour tissue. PeptiCHIP permits cost-effective, rapid, sample-conserving, user-friendly, accurate and standardised tumour neoantigen identification, thereby unleashing the full potential of personalised anti-tumour immunotherapies. In this ERC PoC project, a team of technological and commercial experts will ascertain the technical and commercial viability of the innovative PeptiCHIP device. We will prepare the first steps toward the start-up of a spin-off by defining the most optimal business strategy and model. Furthermore, we will explore the technical potential of the PeptiCHIP and solidify our IP-position. We will develop a solid business strategy based on the technological aspects, the market needs and trends. Finally, during this project we will gain technical and commercial proof-of-concept, providing the necessary information for potential commercialisation routes.",

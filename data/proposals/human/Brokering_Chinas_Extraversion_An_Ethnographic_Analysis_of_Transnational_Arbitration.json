    "title": "Brokering China’s Extraversion: An Ethnographic Analysis of Transnational Arbitration",
    "abstract": "Chinese global engagements are deepening across sectors and geographic regions. The objective of BROKEX is to fill specific gaps in knowledge about how China’s extraversion advances. The project takes an original approach by examining brokers who mediate in transnational fields. It opens the “black box” of China’s global integration by moving beyond descriptions of input and output characteristics to elucidate underlying dynamics. The objective will be achieved in two phases. First, the PI and two postdoctoral researchers will carry out three ethnographic case studies that yield complementary information on the common challenge of brokering across geographic scales: (1) Connecting low-cost Chinese manufacturing with African markets; (2) Integrating Chinese academic research with global scientific communities; (3) Attracting new foreign investments to China to underpin industrial upgrading. The diverse cases offer insights into the mechanisms of brokerage across distinctive sectors. The team will collect data in the Pearl River Delta, South China, while based at Sun Yat-sen University, with which the PI has longstanding collaboration. In the second step, we build on the empirical findings and extant literature to develop brokerage theory. Social scientific research on brokerage commonly uses the morphology of social networks as its starting point, and focuses on how actors positioned at the intersection between groups operate. BROKEX adopts an innovative approach by examining how actors strategically seek to shape network morphologies in order to bridge gaps between groups. By directing theoretical attention towards relationship formation that precedes acts of brokerage, this line of inquiry advances understandings of how and why brokered connections emerge. Ethnographic case studies combined with critical theorization will generate new knowledge about the processes beneath the “rise of China” ─ one of the most consequential socioeconomic developments of our times.",

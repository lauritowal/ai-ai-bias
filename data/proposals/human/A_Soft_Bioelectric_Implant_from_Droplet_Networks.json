    "title": "A Soft Bioelectric Implant from Droplet Networks",
    "abstract": "The goal of BIOELECTRIC is to fabricate and validate robust, durable and biocompatible soft bioelectric implants (SBI) that deliver ionic therapeutics. Fundamental science derived from our ERC Advanced Grant SYNTISU has generated a functional laboratory version of such an implant, but it is extremely fragile. Robustness and durability will be addressed by using advanced hydrogels to build the framework of the SBI and selected block copolymers to improve the performance of the essential membranes within them. These materials will be chosen with a view towards biocompatibility, which will be confirmed by a variety of tests on human cells. The functional properties of the SBIs will be tested on neurons and muscle cells in culture. Variations of the SBI device will be applicable to a wide range of medical conditions: for example, retina replacement, spinal cord regeneration, and wound healing. BIOELECTRIC will also enable us to work with a highly-qualified consultant to conduct market analysis and develop a strong business plan to increase investor confidence, which will in turn allow us to raise significant capital funding for a spin-out company: Soft BioElectric. Accordingly, the scientific program of BIOELECTRIC will culminate in the fabrication of a portable demonstration unit for presentation to potential investors, partner organisations and clinicians. Business planning will be carried out with the support of Oxford Universityâ€™s technology transfer office (OUI) and a select international panel of advisors. The developing awareness that critical cell, tissue and organ behaviours are regulated by endogenous bioelectricity has opened up the new and vital area of bioelectronic medicine. Together, the scientific and business aspects of BIOELECTRIC will expedite the commercial application of SBIs in this emerging field and deliver significant value to the European economy.",

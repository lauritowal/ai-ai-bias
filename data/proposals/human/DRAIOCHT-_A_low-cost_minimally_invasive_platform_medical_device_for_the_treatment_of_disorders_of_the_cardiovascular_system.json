    "abstract": "Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous veins resulting from vein wall weakness and valve incompetence, as shown in Figure 1. Reflux and pooling of blood in the lower limb causes significant patient discomfort due to leg swelling, pain, eczema and subsequent skin changes leading to ulceration, in addition to cosmetic dissatisfaction. This chronic venous disease represents one of the biggest strains on the national health services of European and North American countries, and affects 35% of the adult population in Europe, with this percentage further increasing with age with 40% of women over the age of 50 suffer from a form of chronic venous disease. Currently, varicose veins are treated by surgical removal or ablation of the vein to prevent blood flow through the vessel lumen. Surgical removal (suture ligation and vein stripping) was the traditional gold standard treatment with good long-term clinical outcomes, but due to the risk of general anesthesia and wound complications, open surgery has been superseded by less invasive thermal or chemical (glue-based) ablation procedures over the past 20 years. However, patient safety is a growing concern with glue-based procedures due to the inherent risks of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Similarly, existing thermal ablation solutions are limited by the risk of nerve injury from over-heating and the requirement for large amounts of tumescent anesthesia, involving multiple painful subcutaneous injections to compress and thermally-isolate the vein prior to ablation. To address these significant weaknesses, an ideal therapeutic technology for varicose veins would: 1. Involve no tumescent anesthesia, allowing for faster and less-invasive treatment; 2. Involve no glue/foam to eliminate the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism; 3. Use thermal energy to completely seal the vessel, while protecting all adjacent nerves. This is precisely what is proposed with the DRAIOCHT device.",

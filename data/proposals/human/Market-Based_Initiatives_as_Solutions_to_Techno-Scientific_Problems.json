    "abstract": "MISTS engages with market based initiatives employed as potential solutions to techno-scientific problems. MISTS will draw together two strands of STS research: the turn to research on markets and STS literature on science problems (and solutions). These two areas will be drawn on in exploring four sub-projects which feature market based initiatives as solutions to problems: an attempt to build a market for privacy; an initiative to incentivise vaccine research; a scheme through which trading of evidence in electronic waste could take place; and a national system to render STS research competitive. Objectives: To enhance our understanding of the ways in which market based initiatives are increasingly being harnessed to address techno-scientific problems To understand the genesis, development, experience and consequence of utilising markets as solutions to problems To analyse in-depth the recursive nature of problem-solution relationships To draw together hitherto often separate strands of STS research To develop and consolidate a research programme focused on techno-scientific markets, problems and solutions Market based initiatives are pervasive as apparent solutions to techno-scientific problems. From the management of waste, to attempts to invigorate competition in (social) scientific research, markets are heralded as a means to redistribute economic and moral value, reorient priorities and stimulate action. However, market based initiatives are also frequently critiqued for their apparent failure, for shaping the actions of those subject to them and for a broad variety of other unexpected and unintended consequences. The four sub-projects, addressing key areas of contemporary concern – privacy, health, environment and the future of academia – will form a research programme which will develop insights for the STS research community, for those involved in researching markets and for those interested in techno-scientific problems and solutions.",

    "title": "Low-power spin-wave-based computing",
    "abstract": "Downscaling of Si-based microprocessors has considerably increased the amount of heating in computers and other information and communication technology (ICT) devices. As a result, computer servers in big data centres waste more than 90% of the electricity they pull off the grid. High-density electrical currents in microprocessors and interconnects cause excessive warm-up via an effect known as Joule heating. To fulfil future requirements for data transmission and processing rates with low energy consumption, a paradigm shift away from purely charge-based electronics is needed. Recently, post-Si computing with collective spin wave excitations in tailored magnets has been identified as a promising route. Spin waves are transmitted through a magnetic material without the displacement of electric charges (i.e. currents), thus drastically reducing energy consumption and heating. We recently demonstrated that short-wavelength spin waves can be emitted and manipulated by small voltage pulses in ferroelectric-ferromagnetic bilayers. Both inventions are protected by patent applications. In the ERC PoC project we will use our results to realise an industrially relevant integrated spin wave computing device. In addition, time and money will be invested to file more subsidiary patents, in order to reinforce our IPR portfolio and guarantee our freedom-to-operate in the market. Different ways of industrial collaboration will be investigated, and contacts with suitable partners will be sought. A detailed IPR strategy plan, in preparation for further stages of commercialization, will be finalised before the end of the project.",

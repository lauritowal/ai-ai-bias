    "title": "Polished stone tool biographies and their social and economic impact in the Aegean Neolithic",
    "abstract": "This project explores the emergence of value and wealth as a concept in human history. Social and economic changes accelerated during the Neolithic, but until now it remains unclear what triggered inequality in these communities. Thus, the project aims to nuance how inequality evolved in human history. To approach this key question the study will investigate social and economic transformations initiated by the appearance of polished stone tools (axes, adzes, chisels and wedges) recovered from Neolithic sites, burials, households and quarries from the 7th to the 4th millennium BC in the Aegean. The project hypothesis is linking the Neolithic human awareness of raw material availability and biographies of polished stone tool assemblages with the abstract concepts of the different kinds of value and wealth in these communities. The project will pursue its objectives by initiating four work packages which will, for the first time, document and compare polished stone tools made of rare (jadeitite, nephrite, omphacitite or eclogite) and common (serpentinite, andesite, basalt, gabbro and hematite) raw materials from sites, burials and households in selected synchronic and diachronic case studies. By revealing the location of previously unknown raw material sources and quarry sites of polished stone tools, the project will be able to discover the interrelations between local, regional and superregional exchange networks. Through techno-morphological, use-wear and contextual analysis of polished stone tools, it will be possible to qualify and quantify the different stages of the studied objects, from procurement, manufacture and usage to the final deposition. The data from the polished stone tool assemblages will be related to other materials (lithics, ceramics, bones, shells, obsidian, flint, copper and gold) from the studied sites, burials and households, in order to identify new aspects related to the value of objects and fluctuations in wealth and inequality.",

    "title": "Targeting SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodelling defects in solid tumours",
    "abstract": "Recent large-scale genomic profiling studies have uncovered mutations in the SWI/SNF (SWItch / Sucrose Non-Fermentable) chromatin remodelling complex subunits in 20% of solid tumours. Most of these tumours resist to current therapies. To address this highly unmet medical need, it is crucial to determine how to harness vulnerabilities induced by SWI/SNF defects. Recent evidence shows that SWI/SNF influences the DNA damage response and is involved in shaping tumour immunogenicity. Though, whether there is a link between these observations, and whether the latter may be therapeutically exploited is unknown. Further, the impact of SWI/SNF defects on tumour heterogeneity, a major determinant of resistance to treatment, remains unaddressed. I therefore propose to identify and understand synthetic lethal vulnerabilities associated with two selected SWI/SNF defects of unmet need (PBRM1 and SMARCB1), and to further study how the latter can be exploited to stimulate the anti-tumour immune response. By using hypothesis-testing and -generating approaches including high-throughput screening on in-house developed isogenic and non-isogenic models, I will identify and decipher novel synthetic lethal vulnerabilities associated with PBRM1 and SMARCB1 defects. Molecular biology, high-content imaging and in vivo experiments will be performed to study the effects of drugs that cause synthetic lethality, both on intra-cellular signalling and on anti-tumour immune response. I will further characterise the impact of SMARCB1 defects on tumour heterogeneity using single cell sequencing on preclinical models and human tumour samples. Preclinical data will be integrated with tumour profiling and clinical data, and will guide the development of proof-of-concept clinical studies, as I previously did. The overall research program will identify, decipher mechanistically and evaluate clinically novel immuno-oncology therapeutic strategies for selected SWI/SNF-deficient tumours of unmet need.",

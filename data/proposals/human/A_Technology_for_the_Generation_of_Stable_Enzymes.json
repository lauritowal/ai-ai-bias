    "title": "A Technology for the Generation of Stable Enzymes",
    "abstract": "The general awareness towards a sustainable life style is growing in society. This translates into a growing market for services and products that involve environment-friendly chemistry and material loops. Biotechnology will be one the key drivers when aiming for a circular economy, as it facilitates green chemistry and efficient recycling processes. A central component of most biotechnological processes are biocatalytic proteins (so-called enzymes). However, enzymes are intrinsically vulnerable to elevated temperatures and unnatural microenvironments hampering their wide-spread use in production processes and consumer products. The stabilization of enzymes via small-molecular crosslinkers (INCYPRO), developed in the Grossmann lab, increases the robustness of enzymes towards conditions required for biotechnological applications. INCYPRO has the potential to improve current biotechnological processes and to allow completely new applications. As the method allows straight-forward and broad application, it is suitable for further valorization. In the proposed project, we will develop INCYPRO from its current method state into an innovative and valuable technology (Aim 1). We will further strengthen the intellectual property position (Aim 2) and develop a market valorization strategy (Aim 3). Our commercialization efforts are supported by experts from the private sector and the science-business interface.",

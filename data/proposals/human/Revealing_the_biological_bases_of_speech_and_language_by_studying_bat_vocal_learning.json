    "title": "Revealing the biological bases of speech and language by studying bat vocal learning",
    "abstract": "The overarching goal of BATSPEAK is to shed light on the biological origins of speech and language by analysing the molecular mechanisms and neural circuitry that support vocal learning in the bat, using tools that I have pioneered in this species. Vocal learning is a fundamental building block of human spoken language and is a trait we share with few other animals. It has only been identified in 4 non-human mammal groups, of which bats are the only tractable model system in which the molecular and neural mechanisms can be addressed, thus providing a unique window onto the biological foundations from which human speech and language evolved. BATSPEAK has 3 aims: 1. To identify the genomic markers of vocal learning allowing us to probe the molecular mechanisms that underlie mammalian vocal learning 2. To characterise neural mechanisms underlying mammalian vocal learning 3. To determine direct, causative contributions of molecular and neural mechanisms to mammalian vocal learning behaviour This project will use bats as an exemplar species in which the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying mammalian vocal learning can be understood, and will contain 3 work packages: WP1. Comparative evolutionary genomics, coupled with gene function and gene expression analyses, to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying vocal learning WP2. Comparative neuroanatomy, electrophysiology, and transcriptomics to characterise a key neural circuit underlying vocal learning WP3. Generation of transient transgenic bats to test hypotheses of the role of molecular and neural mechanisms in vocal learning behaviour Understanding the bases of vocal learning in mammals will shed light on the biology underlying speech and language and provide a new mammalian model for the study of language related disorders.",

    "title": "Development of a Bio-Inspired Blood Factory for Personalised Healthcare",
    "abstract": "Personalized medicine is a medical model that proposes the customization of healthcare, with decisions and practices being tailored to the individual patient by use of patient-specific information and/or application of patient-specific cell-based therapies. BioBlood aims to deliver personalised healthcare through a “step change” in the clinical field of haemato-oncology. BioBlood represents an engineered bio-inspired integrated experimental/modelling platform for normal and abnormal haematopoiesis that receives disease & patient input (patient primary cells & patient/disease-specific data) and will produce cellular (red blood cell product) and drug (optimal drug treatment) therapies as its output. Blood supply to meet demand is the primary challenge for Blood Banks and requires significant resources to avoid shortages and ensure safety. An alternative, practical and cost-effective solution to conventional donated blood is essential to reduce patient morbidity and mortality, stabilise and guarantee the donor supply, limit multiple donor exposures, reduce risk of infection of known or as yet unidentified pathogens, and ensure a robust and safe turn-around for blood supply management. BioBlood aims to meet this challenge by developing a novel in vitro platform for the mass production of RBCs for clinical use. More than £32b/year is spent to develop and bring new drugs to market, which takes 14 years. Most patients diagnosed with leukaemias are unable to tolerate treatment and would benefit from novel agents. There is a need to optimise current treatment schedules for cancers such as AML to limit toxicities and improve clinical trial pathways for new drugs to enable personalised healthcare. BioBlood’s in vitro & in silico platform would be a powerful tool to tailor treatments in a patient- and leukaemia-specific chemotherapy schedule by considering the level of toxicity to the specific individual and treatment efficiency for the specific leukaemia a priori.",

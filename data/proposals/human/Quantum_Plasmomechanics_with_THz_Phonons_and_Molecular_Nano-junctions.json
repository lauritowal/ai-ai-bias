    "title": "Quantum Plasmomechanics with THz Phonons and Molecular Nano-junctions",
    "abstract": "QTONE aims at discovering new quantum phenomena involving THz vibrational modes, and at gaining control over them using novel concepts inspired from cavity quantum optomechanics and new techniques developed for nano-plasmonics and molecular break-junctions. The three main goals of the project are: (i) Perform optomechanical quantum information processing with THz phonons in low-dimensional systems, using a combination of ultrafast spectroscopy and time-correlated photon counting to measure quantum correlations mediated by non-classical vibrational states. (ii) Demonstrate the feasibility of dynamical backaction amplification of THz phonons by coupling molecules and nanomaterials to plasmonic cavities and by leveraging exciton-phonon coupling to realize exciton-assisted optomechanics. (iii) Interrogate and drive a single-molecule inside a plasmonic nanocavity using simultaneous inelastic electron tunneling and Raman spectroscopies in a molecular break-junction with engineered plasmonic resonance. I anticipate that this project will have widespread impacts on our understanding of quantum phenomena in molecular-scale oscillators, and will foster the excellence of Europe in fields ranging from fundamental science to quantum technologies and molecular electronics.",

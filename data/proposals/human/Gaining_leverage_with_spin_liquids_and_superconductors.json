    "abstract": "TROPIC will design new experiments to uncover the topological properties of quantum materials that will revolutionize quantum computing. Conventional approaches that rely on local interactions between qubits suffer from seemingly insurmountable problems, such as controlling quantum decoherence while still achieving a useful number of qubits. Alternative approaches based on nonlocal topological excitations, such as Majorana fermions, could provide a solution but clear evidence for their existence is missing. TROPIC aims to identify topological signatures of quantum spin liquids and superconductors by revolutionizing a technique—resonant torsion magnetometry—that was recently developed by the PI. Our approach is unique in its extreme sensitivity to materials properties that are notoriously concealed. This proposal consists of three aims that focus on systems with promising hints of topology: the quantum spin liquid RuCl3 and the spin triplet superconductor UTe2. Each aim requires significant advances that will allow us to access the magnetotropic coefficient—the thermodynamic coefficient associated with magnetic anisotropy—in new classes of materials for the first time (aim 2) while obtaining new information (aim 3). The aims are summarized as: 1. Refining resonant torsion to identify topological order associated with Majorana fermions in RuCl3. 2. Extending resonant torsion to high magnetic fields to investigate unconventional superconductivity in UTe2. 3. Developing resonant torsion to higher frequencies to search for slow topological excitations. Recent media articles by quantum computing pioneers have warned that the hype is surpassing the performance. A material revolution is needed to realize the promise of quantum computing. We will develop a new experimental probes that will be applicable to broad classes of topological materials, including small and fragile 2D systems and heterostructures where thermodynamic measurements are needed.",

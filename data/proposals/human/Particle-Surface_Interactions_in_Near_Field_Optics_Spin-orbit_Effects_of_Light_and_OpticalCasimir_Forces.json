    "title": "Particle-Surface Interactions in Near Field Optics: Spin-orbit Effects of Light and Optical/Casimir Forces",
    "abstract": "PSINFONI aims to open new avenues of research in ultrafast routing and polarization synthesis of light in nanophotonics, and in the manipulation, sorting, levitation and trapping of nanoparticles, molecules, or single atoms near novel nanomaterial surfaces. To this end, we will explore the fundamentals and applications of a range of novel nanophotonic phenomena: (i) spin-orbit interactions of light for polarization-controlled optical routing and polarization synthesis at the nanoscale; (ii) repulsive and switchable lateral optical forces on particles near engineered surfaces for optical manipulation and sorting; and (iii) Casimir repulsive and lateral forces for quantum levitation / frictionless nanomaterials. All these diverse phenomena can be studied under the single framework of particle-surface interactions in the near field, greatly diversifying the research outcomes from a single research effort. Knowledge of the full 3D electromagnetic fields in particle-surface systems will form the foundation from which to explore fundamental aspects and limitations of the above mentioned effects, opening new applications in information technologies and new nanomaterials. Proof of principle experimental demonstrations will be performed where possible.",

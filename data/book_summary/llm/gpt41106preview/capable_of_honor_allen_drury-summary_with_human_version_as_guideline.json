        "\"Capable of Honor\" by Allen Drury is a political thriller that continues the saga from Drury's earlier novel, \"Advise and Consent.\" The story takes place in an America embroiled in international conflict, as President Harley Hudson, a character known for his affability but also his ineffectiveness, faces a tough re-election campaign against the backdrop of the Soviet Union's support for rebel governments in Panama and the fictional African republic of Gorotoland.\n\nThe United States, under Hudson's leadership, has deployed troops to both regions, but the military interventions are not going well, leading to a quagmire that dominates the national conversation. As the election season intensifies, the focus shifts to foreign policy, with the media and political forces rallying behind a peace candidate. They find their champion in Governor Ted Jason of California, a popular figure but one criticized for his lack of firm principles.\n\nJason enters the presidential race late but quickly gains support, particularly from the media, which had initially been rooting for a showdown between him and Secretary of State Orrin Knox for the Presidential nomination. Despite the media's efforts to promote Jason, internal party dynamics come into play when President Hudson announces that the Vice Presidential nomination will be open for contest, leading to a face-off between Knox, who is a staunch supporter of Hudson's policies, and the more pacifist Jason.\n\nAs the Majority Party's convention unfolds in San Francisco, the narrative highlights the polarizing and turbulent nature of American politics, with extreme factions from both the Left and Right coalescing around Jason. The convention is marred by violence, including a brutal attack on Knox's daughter-in-law, and a bitter split over the party platform.\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Jason challenges Hudson for the party's nomination, leading to a closely contested battle. The media, meanwhile, continues its biased coverage, heavily influencing public perception. Ceil Jason, the Governor's wife, becomes disillusioned with her husband's moral flexibility and his tolerance of the convention's violence, leading to a personal crisis that culminates in her leaving him.\n\nUltimately, Hudson secures the nomination by a narrow margin, and in a calculated political move, he publicly rejects Jason as his running mate during his acceptance speech, labeling him as a political opportunist. Instead, Hudson endorses Knox, whom the convention nominates as Vice President. This outcome causes a significant rift in the party, with nearly half of the delegates walking out, much to the delight of the media pundits who anticipate the potential rise of a third-party movement from the disgruntled delegates.\n\n\"Capable of Honor\" is a compelling exploration of the intricacies of American politics, the role of the media in shaping public opinion, and the personal and ethical dilemmas faced by those in the corridors of power. Drury's novel paints a portrait of a nation at a crossroads, where the quest for political victory often overshadows the pursuit of principled leadership.",

Use the sample as a guideline for quality and level of detail.\n\n---\n\nTitle: Capable of Honor [Allen Drury]\n\nDescription: In the novel, Harley Hudson, the affable but inept Vice President from Advise and Consent, is now president and seeking a term of his own against a backdrop of Soviet-instigated war, as the Soviet Union backs rebel governments in Panama and in the fictitious African republic of Gorotoland. Hudson responds with U.S. troops in both countries, and the conflicts soon bog down. The election season soon turns on these foreign policy questions, with the media and others seeking a peace candidate &mdash; and finding it in the popular but weak-willed Governor Ted Jason of California. Having announced his candidacy late, Hudson announces an open contest for the Vice Presidential nomination, in which Secretary of State Orrin Knox, who supports Hudson's policies, opposes Jason. The media, who had supported Jason heavily when it looked like it would be a Knox-Jason race for the Presidential nomination, continues its effort for a Jason victory by any means they can. At the convention in San Francisco, extreme elements of the Left and Right combine to support Jason, and there are several violent incidents, including one in which Knox's daughter-in-law is brutally attacked. When it becomes clear that the convention is split down the middle in fights over the platform, Jason challenges Hudson for the Majority Party's nomination (the novels never use the proper names \"Republican\" or \"Democrat\" but the descriptions of Majority Party corresponds strongly to the Democrats of the 1960s). The media, meantime, spins merrily away, filtering what the country is allowed to see and hear from San Francisco. Ceil Jason, the Governor's wife, leaves him when her husband's lack of principle and willingness to tolerate the violence sinks in to her. Hudson wins narrowly, and Jason expects the Vice Presidential nomination since he commands the support of almost half the convention. Hudson seems amenable, and places Jason on the dais as he makes his acceptance speech. Hudson humiliates Jason by making it clear that he considers Jason a panderer, and states he will accept Knox, and only Knox, as his running mate. The convention duly nominates Knox, but almost half its delegates walk out, to the pleasure of the media commentators, who predict a third-party convention from among the disaffected delegates."

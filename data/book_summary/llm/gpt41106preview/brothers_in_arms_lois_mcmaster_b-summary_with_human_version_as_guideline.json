        "\"Brothers in Arms\" by Lois McMaster Bujold continues the saga of Miles Vorkosigan, picking up after the events of the Dagoola IV escape. Miles, alongside his loyal Dendarii mercenaries, arrives on Earth, seeking sanctuary and repairs for their battle-damaged fleet. However, Earth proves to be less of a safe haven and more a hotbed of political intrigue for Miles, who must navigate the complexities of his dual identity as both Admiral Naismith of the Dendarii Free Mercenary Fleet and Lord Miles Vorkosigan of Barrayar.\n\nUpon visiting the Barrayaran Embassy to secure payment for the Dendarii's recent mission, Miles is unexpectedly reassigned to an embassy position and placed under the command of Captain Duv Galeni, a Komarran with a deep-seated grudge related to Miles' father, Aral Vorkosigan. The tension between Miles and Galeni adds a layer of internal conflict as Miles grapples with his loyalty to Barrayar and his responsibility to his mercenary fleet.\n\nThe plot takes a surprising turn when Miles encounters a clone of himself, created by Komarran radicals to assassinate key Barrayaran figures and further their political agenda. This clone, intended to replace and eventually kill Miles, is the physical embodiment of Miles' internal dichotomy, sharing his genetic makeup but having been shaped by a starkly different upbringing.\n\nIn an intense confrontation with his clone, who would be named Mark Pierre Vorkosigan by Barrayaran tradition, Miles thwarts the assassination plot. Instead of treating Mark as an enemy, Miles acknowledges the clone as his brother, in accordance with Betan law, and is keenly aware that his mother, the indomitable Cordelia, would never forgive him if he turned his back on family, no matter how unconventional the circumstances of Mark's creation.\n\nMiles concocts a plan to use Mark to deceive the Cetagandans, who are suspicious of the link between Naismith and Vorkosigan. The ruse buys them both time, and in a gesture of brotherhood and understanding, Miles grants Mark his freedom, along with a significant amount of money. He extends an invitation for Mark to embrace his Vorkosigan heritage if he chooses to, leaving Mark with the opportunity to forge his own path, free from the designs of those who created him for nefarious purposes.\n\n\"Brothers in Arms\" weaves a complex narrative of identity, loyalty, and kinship, challenging Miles and the reader to consider the true meaning of family and the lengths one will go to protect it. With its compelling mix of action, political drama, and personal development, the novel is a standout entry in the Vorkosigan Saga.",

Miles visits the Barrayaran Embassy so the Dendarii can be paid for their last mission.

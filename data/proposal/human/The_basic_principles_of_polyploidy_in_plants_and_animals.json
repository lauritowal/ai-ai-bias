    "title": "The basic principles of polyploidy in plants and animals",
    "abstract": "Many eukaryotes have more than two sets of chromosomes due to whole-genome duplication (WGD) and are called polyploids. WGDs explain many cases of speciation bursts and evolutionary inventions. Some evidence suggests an adaptive advantage of polyploids: the origins of many ancient WGDs correspond to the times of extreme climate change, and contemporary polyploids often occupy harsher environments compared to their ancestors. However, most new polyploids are not as lucky and rarely survive. To explain the cause, predict and manipulate this process, we need to understand the basic principles of polyploidy: (1) how it is triggered, (2) what enables the initial survival of newly formed polyploids, and (3) how they stabilize a population and become successful. My program will comprehensively cover all these aspects, from the functional and genetic levels to the evolutionary forces driving the entire process. I propose a cross-disciplinary approach to identify common polyploidy principles in plant and animal diploid-tetraploid species complexes: Arabidopsis lyrata, widespread plant in Northern Hemisphere, and Neobatrachus, burrowing frogs living in the Australian desert. The approach combines classic genetics with the latest genomics technologies and population genetics analysis of natural herbarium and museum collections across broad geographies. I will (1) expose genetic and environmental predispositions to polyploidy formation by mapping natural variation of the unreduced gametes rates; (2) reveal mechanics and genetics stabilizing meiosis in polyploids, comparing recombination and selection across ploidies; (3) uncover polyploid populations recovery processes after bottlenecks accompanying their origin by reconstructing introgression patterns. Deciphering the mechanisms leading to successful polyploidization across the plant and animal kingdoms will deliver groundbreaking advances relevant across biology, agriculture, and medicine.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of new functionalities into cells is a challenge, but it offers tremendous opportunities. While some traits may be acquired through lateral gene transfer and be immediately operational, others are complex and require comprehensive rewiring of the host cell due to lack of orthogonality. A powerful strategy used by cells to acquire new properties is the incorporation of other dedicated cells as endosymbionts that may eventually become organelles in the course of evolution, the most prominent example being the origin of the mitochondrion and chloroplast, both of which transformed life as we know it. SYMBIOSES is an interdisciplinary project that will explore endosymbioses in an experimental approach to introduce metabolic traits as cellular compartments. In the first phase of the project, we will (i) design novel cell-in-cell merger couples composed of a unicellular eukaryote as the host and a prokaryote as the designated endosymbiont and use modelling to optimize the metabolic pre-requisites for cooperation and ultimately endosymbioses, (ii) establish cooperating co-cultures of cells that depend on each other metabolically, and (iii) develop nanotechnology approaches to incorporate cells into other cells. In the second phase of the project, we will deliver cells into cells to establish endosymbioses as operating units. We will then optimize endosymbioses by re-engineering and experimental evolution. The approach will unite desired traits consisting of core metabolic processes with a focus on biological nitrogen and carbon fixation. SYMBIOSES will establish know-how and concepts for the introduction of novel compartmentalized functions into organisms and put endosymbioses and ultimately organellogenesis to the test.",

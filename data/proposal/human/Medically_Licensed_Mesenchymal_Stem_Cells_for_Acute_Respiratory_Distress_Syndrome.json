    "abstract": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating condition, which kills 40% of sufferers, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide annually. Despite decades of intensive research efforts, there are no clinical therapeutic strategies available for this catastrophic condition. In our ERC Starter Grant, HA-NFkB-VILI, we have shown Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to be beneficial in several relevant preclinical ARDS models. Pre-clinical evaluation of freshly harvested MSCs shows promising therapeutic effects in multiple in vitro and in vivo lung injury models. However, for cell therapies to be successfully used in the clinic, they will need to be sourced allogeneically, culture passaged and cryofrozen for transport to the clinical site, where they can then thawed near the bedside and administered to the patient with ARDS. In 2013, CCMI, based in and owned by NUI Galway, was licensed to produce medical grade MSCs. While this product has been proven to be both safe and retaining MSC lineage potency, it remains to be demonstrated that the cryofrozen CCMI-hMSC can reproduce the immense promise exhibited by freshly harvested MSCs in lung injury models. A demonstration that the cryofrozen CCMI-hMSC exhibit therapeutic potential would be a major step forward, and would be advanced for clinical testing by the Irish Critical Care Trials Group. Given the economic burden of ARDs, should this therapy prove effective, the economic benefits would be very substantial. As such, the purpose of this proposal is to complete the pre-clinical evaluation of a cryofrozen, medicinally licensed, MSC product and to demonstrate its efficacy in relevant pre-clinical models in order to facilitate movement towards of Phase I/II clinical trials and to eventually realise their full commercial and medicinal potential for NUI Galway and the EU.",

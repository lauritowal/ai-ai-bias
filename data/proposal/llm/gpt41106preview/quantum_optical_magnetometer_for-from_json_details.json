        "Abstract:\n\nThe INTERFACE project introduces a groundbreaking optical magnetometer, the QUANTUM OPTICAL MAGNETOMETER FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, poised to transform the landscape of bio- and medical diagnostics. This innovative device is designed to sensitively detect weak magnetic fields emanating from human nerves, eyes, and brain tissue, with applications extending into critical areas such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and congenital blindness. A significant drawback of the current gold standard in magnetic field detection, superconducting magnetometers (SQUIDs), is their reliance on expensive cryogenic cooling, which inhibits widespread use in medical diagnostics. The proposed optical magnetometer, developed within the INTERFACE project and advancing under the QUMAG initiative, is engineered to operate effectively at room and human body temperatures, eliminating the need for cryogenic conditions. This novel approach is based on the meticulous optimization of quantum noise in light-atom interactions, which has already demonstrated the ability to detect action potential magnetic signals from nerves. By collaborating with medical researchers and leading ophthalmologists, the project aims to culminate in the development of a magnetoretinographâ€”a small, fiber-connected chip designed for noninvasive, cost-effective, and ultrasensitive eye diagnostics. This technology promises significant market potential by addressing the urgent need for accessible and improved diagnostic tools for eye diseases, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes."

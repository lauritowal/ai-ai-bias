        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Cell Migration in Gut Homeostasis and Cancer Invasion - Role of Microenvironment\n\nThe proposed research project aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of epithelial cell migration within the intestinal epithelium, a process vital for gut homeostasis, and to unravel the complex interactions between cancer cells, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and the microenvironment during cancer invasion. Our study will leverage a multi-disciplinary approach integrating cancer cell biology and physics, employing cutting-edge optical technologies, including two-photon microscopy, intravital imaging, and advanced 3D culture systems.\n\nThe intestinal epithelium is a dynamic structure that undergoes constant renewal, with cell division in the crypts and cell migration toward the villi, culminating in apoptosis at the villi tips. Disruption of this balance can lead to pathological conditions like cancer, where the basement membrane (BM) serves as a critical barrier to prevent the spread of primary tumors. This research will address the pivotal question: do cancer cells invade the stroma, or is the stroma invading tumor cells?\n\nOur specific aims are: (1) to determine the mechanism of epithelial cell migration in gut homeostasis using intestinal slice cultures and two-photon microscopy; (2) to examine the cooperation between cancer cells and CAFs in breaching the BM using a 3D in vitro model; (3) to explore how cancer cells and CAFs collaborate during invasion of the stroma with 3D chemoattraction assays; and (4) to characterize the in vivo cooperation between cancer cells and CAFs in ortotopic mouse models through intravital imaging.\n\nExpected outcomes include identifying the migration mechanisms of epithelial cells, deciphering the roles of cancer cells and various CAF sub-populations in BM degradation, and understanding how CAFs may guide cancer cells toward vasculature, potentially triggering metastasis.\n\nThis project promises to provide critical insights into the fundamental mechanisms of cell migration in 3D environments and the intricate crosstalk between cancer cells and the stroma, with profound implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting tumor invasion and metastasis."

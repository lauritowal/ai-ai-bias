        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Cell migration in gut homeostasis and cancer invasion - role of microenvironment,\" seeks to elucidate the complex interplay between cell migration, apoptosis, and cell division in maintaining gut homeostasis and how disruptions in these processes contribute to cancer progression. With a special focus on the interactions between cancer cells, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and the basement membrane (BM), this multi-disciplinary study aims to unravel the dynamics of tumor invasion and the role of the microenvironment in cancer pathogenesis.\n\nThe intestinal epithelium undergoes constant renewal, a process tightly regulated by cell division in the crypts, migration towards the villi, and apoptosis at the villi tips. However, pathologies, notably cancer, may arise when the balance between these processes is disturbed. This project will investigate who is invading whom - whether cancer cells invade the stroma or stromal cells infiltrate the tumor - using a combination of advanced optics, two-photon microscopy, intravital imaging, and both in vitro and in vivo models.\n\nOur specific aims include: 1) determining the mechanisms of epithelial cell migration in gut homeostasis via intestinal slice cultures and two-photon microscopy, 2) examining the cooperation between cancer cells and CAFs in breaching the BM using a 3D in vitro model, 3) exploring how cancer cells and CAFs collaborate during stromal invasion with 3D chemoattraction assays, and 4) characterizing the in vivo cooperation of cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression and metastasis using intravital imaging and ortotopic mouse models.\n\nThe expected outcomes encompass a detailed understanding of the migration mechanisms of epithelial cells, the specific roles of cancer cells and CAFs in BM degradation, the guidance of cancer cells by CAFs, and the identification of CAF sub-populations critical for metastasis. This research, spanning cancer cell biology and physics, leverages recent optical technological advances to provide groundbreaking insights into the fundamental mechanisms of cell migration in 3D environments, with implications for understanding intestinal homeostasis and tumor invasion.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Cell Migration in Gut Homeostasis and Cancer Invasion - Role of Microenvironment\n\nThe integrity of intestinal epithelium is critical for gut homeostasis, and its disruption can lead to pathologies such as cancer. Our research aims to delineate the mechanisms underlying epithelial cell migration and the dynamic interactions with the microenvironment during cancer invasion. This project will investigate whether the uncoupling of cell proliferation from apoptosis and migration contributes to cancer progression, and how carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells cooperate to breach the basement membrane (BM), facilitating tumor spread.\n\nWe propose a multi-disciplinary approach, combining cancer cell biology and physics, utilizing recent advances in optics, including two-photon microscopy and intravital imaging. Our study models include intestinal slice cultures, 3D in vitro models, and 3D chemoattraction assays, as well as ortotopic mouse models for in vivo analysis.\n\nThe specific aims of our study are: 1) to determine the mechanism of epithelial cell migration in gut homeostasis using intestinal slice cultures and two-photon microscopy; 2) to examine the cooperation between cancer cells and CAFs in breaking the BM using a 3D in vitro model; 3) to explore the collaborative invasion of the stroma by cancer cells and CAFs through 3D chemoattraction assays; and 4) to characterize the in vivo cooperation between cancer cells and CAFs using intravital imaging and ortotopic mouse models.\n\nOur hypothesis is centered on discerning the directional invasion in carcinomas – whether cancer cells invade the stroma or the stroma invades tumor cells. By addressing these aims, we expect to uncover the mechanisms of epithelial cell migration, identify the specific cell types degrading the BM, reveal how CAFs guide cancer cells, and pinpoint specific sub-populations of CAFs that trigger metastasis. This research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular events that regulate cancer invasion and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Cell Migration in Gut Homeostasis and Cancer Invasion - Role of Microenvironment\n\nThe proposed research project aims to elucidate the complex dynamics of cell migration within the gut microenvironment, focusing on both homeostatic processes and cancer invasion. The intestinal epithelium undergoes constant renewal, with a complete turnover every week—a process that involves cell division, migration, and apoptosis. Disruption of the balance between these processes can lead to pathological conditions such as cancer, where the basement membrane (BM), a critical barrier preventing tumor spread, becomes compromised.\n\nThis multi-disciplinary study, integrating cancer cell biology and physics, will utilize recent advances in optics and technologies such as two-photon microscopy, 3D in vitro models, chemoattraction assays, and intravital imaging in ortotopic mouse models. Our specific aims are to: (1) Determine the mechanism of epithelial cell migration in gut homeostasis through intestinal slice cultures and two-photon microscopy, (2) Examine the cooperation between cancer cells and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the degradation of the BM using a 3D in vitro model, (3) Explore the joint invasion actions of cancer cells and CAFs in the stroma via 3D chemoattraction assays, and (4) Characterize this cooperation in vivo to understand the interactions and identify specific CAF sub-populations that may trigger metastasis.\n\nThe research questions focus on the directionality of invasion: Do cancer cells invade the stroma or is the stroma itself facilitating the tumor cells' spread? The study's outcomes will provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of cell migration within 3D environments, the role of CAFs in cancer progression, and the potential identification of new therapeutic targets to prevent cancer invasion and metastasis. By combining experimental models that reflect intestinal homeostasis and tumor invasion, our research endeavors to make significant contributions to the understanding of cancer biology and treatment.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Cell Migration in Gut Homeostasis and Cancer Invasion - Role of Microenvironment\n\nThe proposed research project aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of epithelial cell migration within the intestinal epithelium, a process vital for gut homeostasis, and to unravel the complex interactions between cancer cells, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and the microenvironment during cancer invasion. Our study will leverage a multi-disciplinary approach integrating cancer cell biology and physics, employing cutting-edge optical technologies, including two-photon microscopy, intravital imaging, and advanced 3D culture systems.\n\nThe intestinal epithelium is a dynamic structure that undergoes constant renewal, with cell division in the crypts and cell migration toward the villi, culminating in apoptosis at the villi tips. Disruption of this balance can lead to pathological conditions like cancer, where the basement membrane (BM) serves as a critical barrier to prevent the spread of primary tumors. This research will address the pivotal question: do cancer cells invade the stroma, or is the stroma invading tumor cells?\n\nOur specific aims are: (1) to determine the mechanism of epithelial cell migration in gut homeostasis using intestinal slice cultures and two-photon microscopy; (2) to examine the cooperation between cancer cells and CAFs in breaching the BM using a 3D in vitro model; (3) to explore how cancer cells and CAFs collaborate during invasion of the stroma with 3D chemoattraction assays; and (4) to characterize the in vivo cooperation between cancer cells and CAFs in ortotopic mouse models through intravital imaging.\n\nExpected outcomes include identifying the migration mechanisms of epithelial cells, deciphering the roles of cancer cells and various CAF sub-populations in BM degradation, and understanding how CAFs may guide cancer cells toward vasculature, potentially triggering metastasis.\n\nThis project promises to provide critical insights into the fundamental mechanisms of cell migration in 3D environments and the intricate crosstalk between cancer cells and the stroma, with profound implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting tumor invasion and metastasis."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Children and Adolescents with PaRental mental Illness: Understanding the ‘who’ and ‘how’ of targeting interventions\" (CAPRI) project aims to address the urgent political and public health concerns associated with the offspring of parents experiencing mental illness. With an estimated 10% of mothers and 5% of fathers affected, these children are at significant risk of family disruption, educational challenges, and social adversity, including deprivation and repeated hospitalisation.\n\nThis innovative research, led by the University of Manchester, proposes the establishment of a new Centre in Bioepidemiology, combining epidemiological and neuroscientific disciplines to deepen our understanding of CAPRI. The project aligns with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health in Europe (CAMHEE) report recommendations, which emphasize the necessity for targeted interventions and improved information on the risks and resilience factors associated with CAPRI.\n\nThe research encompasses three work packages: WP1 will create a unique linkage across three population datasets in Sweden and Australia to quantify CAPRI and chart a broad range of life outcomes. WP2 will extend the analysis to unravel the longitudinal effects of social adversity. WP3 will pioneer the linking of epidemiological data with neuroimaging (NIRS) techniques to detect abnormal cognitive development in infants at risk due to severe maternal mental illness.\n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to employ the epidemiological profiles and NIRS biomarkers to identify children at high risk and in need of intervention. By evaluating different interventions, the project seeks to significantly improve life outcomes for CAPRI. This groundbreaking interdisciplinary programme leverages a unique combination of expertise in epidemiology and neuroscience to deliver on the CAMHEE objectives for CAPRI, with a vision to revolutionize the approach to mental health care for affected families.\n\nWord Count: 245",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe University of Manchester proposes an innovative and interdisciplinary research project titled \"Children and Adolescents with PaRental mental Illness: Understanding the ‘who’ and ‘how’ of targeting interventions\" (CAPRI). This groundbreaking program aims to improve the life outcomes of children and adolescents with parental mental illness, a group that represents approximately 10% of offspring of mothers and 5% of offspring of fathers with mental health conditions. The project responds to urgent public health and political concerns highlighted in the \"Child and Adolescent Mental Health in Europe\" (CAMHEE) report, which calls for enhanced knowledge of CAPRI risks, resilience, and targeted interventions for those at the highest risk.\n\nThrough a combination of epidemiology and neuroscience, the project will execute three interconnected work packages. WP1 will create a unique linkage across three population datasets in Sweden and Australia to detail CAPRI numbers and a broad range of life outcomes, while also disentangling the effects of social adversity over time. WP2 will expand upon the foundation established in WP1 with further detailed analysis. WP3 will innovate by linking epidemiological findings with neuroimaging, using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to detect abnormal cognitive development in at-risk infants, particularly those born to mothers with severe mental illness.\n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to construct a new Centre in Bioepidemiology at the University of Manchester, which will specialize in the integration of epidemiological profiling with neuroimaging biomarkers. This center will identify high-risk children requiring intervention and evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions to alleviate the impact of parental mental illness.\n\nThe project's comprehensive approach will generate better information on CAPRI risks and resilience, aiming to acknowledge and attend to the needs of children and families affected by parental mental health issues. By addressing deprivation and repeated hospitalization, the program's innovative research strategies promise to deliver on CAMHEE's objectives and significantly enhance our ability to support CAPRI individuals, thereby improving their outcomes and quality of life.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Children and Adolescents with PaRental mental Illness: Understanding the ‘who’ and ‘how’ of targeting interventions\" (CAPRI) addresses a critical and under-recognized issue: the impact of parental mental illness on children and adolescents. Approximately 10% of mothers and 5% of fathers suffer from mental illness, significantly affecting family, educational, and social domains. This project, spearheaded by the University of Manchester, proposes the establishment of a new Centre in Bioepidemiology to focus on the urgent political and public health concerns surrounding CAPRI as highlighted in the \"Child and Adolescent Mental Health in Europe\" (CAMHEE) report.\n\nThe project's multi-disciplinary approach combines elements of epidemiology and neuroscience to develop targeted interventions aimed at improving life outcomes for CAPRI. It is structured around three work packages (WP). WP1 will create a unique linkage across three population datasets in Sweden and Australia to detail CAPRI numbers and life outcomes, disentangling the effects of social adversity. WP2 builds on WP1 with additional unspecified details. WP3 will link epidemiology with neuroimaging (NIRS) to identify abnormal cognitive development in at-risk infants of mothers with severe mental illness. These work packages are designed to fulfill recommendations from CAMHEE, such as acknowledging the needs of affected children and families and providing better information on CAPRI risks and resilience.\n\nThe research goal is to combine epidemiological profiling with NIRS biomarkers to identify high-risk children who require intervention. Future aims include evaluating different interventions to determine their effectiveness in this context. Ultimately, the project seeks to inform and transform practices and policies to improve the life outcomes of children and adolescents impacted by parental mental illness.\n\nThis groundbreaking interdisciplinary programme harnesses unique expertise in epidemiology and neuroscience to meet the CAMHEE objectives for CAPRI, promising to advance our understanding and ability to support this vulnerable population.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Children and Adolescents with PaRental mental Illness: Understanding the ‘who’ and ‘how’ of targeting interventions\n\nThe University of Manchester proposes an innovative interdisciplinary research project addressing the urgent political and public health concern of children and adolescents with parental mental illness (CAPRI). With 10% of mothers and 5% of fathers affected by mental illness, the implications span across family, educational, and social domains. The project aligns with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health in Europe (CAMHEE) report, which emphasizes the need for better information on the risks and resilience associated with CAPRI, as well as specific interventions for those at highest risk.\n\nThe research aims to improve life outcomes for CAPRI by integrating epidemiology and neuroscience. A new Centre in Bioepidemiology will be established, focusing on three main work packages (WPs). WP1 will create a unique linkage across three population datasets in Sweden and Australia to detail CAPRI numbers and life outcomes, investigating the impact of social adversity over time. WP2 will expand upon the objectives of WP1 with additional analyses. WP3 will pioneer the use of neuroimaging (NIRS) to detect abnormal cognitive development in at-risk infants, particularly those with mothers suffering from severe mental illness.\n\nThe future aims of the research include the development of epidemiological profiles coupled with NIRS biomarkers to identify high-risk children who need targeted interventions. Additionally, the project intends to evaluate the efficacy of different interventions.\n\nThis groundbreaking programme will leverage the University of Manchester's combined expertise in epidemiology and neuroscience to meet CAMHEE's objectives for CAPRI, acknowledging the needs of affected families and advancing our understanding of risk factors and protective measures. The anticipated outcome is a transformative impact on the lives of CAPRI through informed and targeted interventions, contributing to a reduction in the intergenerational transmission of mental illness.\n\nKeywords: CAPRI, mental illness, epidemiology, neuroscience, NIRS, interventions, public health, bioepidemiology."

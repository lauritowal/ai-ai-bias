        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Children and Adolescents with PaRental mental Illness: Understanding the ‘who’ and ‘how’ of targeting interventions\n\nThe University of Manchester proposes an innovative interdisciplinary research project addressing the urgent political and public health concern of children and adolescents with parental mental illness (CAPRI). With 10% of mothers and 5% of fathers affected by mental illness, the implications span across family, educational, and social domains. The project aligns with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health in Europe (CAMHEE) report, which emphasizes the need for better information on the risks and resilience associated with CAPRI, as well as specific interventions for those at highest risk.\n\nThe research aims to improve life outcomes for CAPRI by integrating epidemiology and neuroscience. A new Centre in Bioepidemiology will be established, focusing on three main work packages (WPs). WP1 will create a unique linkage across three population datasets in Sweden and Australia to detail CAPRI numbers and life outcomes, investigating the impact of social adversity over time. WP2 will expand upon the objectives of WP1 with additional analyses. WP3 will pioneer the use of neuroimaging (NIRS) to detect abnormal cognitive development in at-risk infants, particularly those with mothers suffering from severe mental illness.\n\nThe future aims of the research include the development of epidemiological profiles coupled with NIRS biomarkers to identify high-risk children who need targeted interventions. Additionally, the project intends to evaluate the efficacy of different interventions.\n\nThis groundbreaking programme will leverage the University of Manchester's combined expertise in epidemiology and neuroscience to meet CAMHEE's objectives for CAPRI, acknowledging the needs of affected families and advancing our understanding of risk factors and protective measures. The anticipated outcome is a transformative impact on the lives of CAPRI through informed and targeted interventions, contributing to a reduction in the intergenerational transmission of mental illness.\n\nKeywords: CAPRI, mental illness, epidemiology, neuroscience, NIRS, interventions, public health, bioepidemiology."

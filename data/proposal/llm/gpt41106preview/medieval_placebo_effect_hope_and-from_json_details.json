        "Abstract:\n\nThe historical research proposal \"Medieval Placebo Effect: Hope and Belief in Healthcare in Christian Southern Europe 1100-1500\" (MedPlaceboEffect) seeks to explore the underappreciated role of the placebo effect in late medieval health systems. This project aims to recover the significance of hope, expectation for cure, belief, and trust within the context of the healing encounter during the period of 1100-1500 in Southern Europe. By adopting a triangular approach that scrutinizes ideas, practices, and the organizing structures of healing activity, the project endeavors to analyze the medieval placebo effect as a fundamental aspect of health and recovery.\n\nThe proposed study will engage in a dialogue with current debates on the symbolic aspects of therapeutic interventions while considering medieval perceptions of the soul-body relationship. It is poised to shed light on the engagement of medieval healing practices with hope, expectations, belief, and trust, thereby demonstrating the pervasiveness of placebo effect sensibilities during the time. Through an examination of the impact of the soul and mind as formative components of healing theory and technique, the project will reveal the dynamics between ideas, practices, institutions, and networks that fostered a healing environment predicated on hope, belief, and trust.\n\nExpected outcomes of the MedPlaceboEffect project include casting new light on medieval healing practices, laying the groundwork for examining 21st-century health sensibilities, and directly addressing current challenges in healthcare such as distrust in medical services and the difficulty of overcoming placebos in pharmaceutical research. This historical examination of the placebo effect as a paradigmatic attribute of period healing contributes to a deeper understanding of medieval healing and its enduring legacy in European medicine, offering pathways for thinking about critical elements of therapy essential for effective healthcare today."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe central nervous system (CNS) is a critical battlefield for viral infections where the immune response must be delicately balanced to ensure pathogen clearance without causing neuronal damage. Our proposal, titled \"Molecular pathology of anti-viral T cell responses in the central nervous system,\" seeks to understand the intricate interactions between non-cytolytic CD8+ T cells and neurons during viral assault. The project, codenamed PATHOCODE, hypothesizes that inflammatory signaling triggered by these immune cells induces metabolic and epigenetic alterations leading to irreversible neuronal dysfunction.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, PATHOCODE is structured around four objectives utilizing cutting-edge methodologies. The first objective employs single nucleus RNA sequencing to identify specific neuronal vulnerabilities and to distinguish between antigen-specific and bystander effects of inflammation. The second and third objectives will use novel cell-specific mitochondrial and nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to uncover the metabolic and epigenetic consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement with neurons. Lastly, leveraging CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the fourth objective aims to rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by correcting disrupted metabolic pathways.\n\nThe expected outcome of PATHOCODE is to provide groundbreaking molecular insight into immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases. By revealing the underlying mechanisms of non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions with neurons, the study has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets that could mitigate the damaging consequences of the immune response to viral infections in the CNS, thus preserving neuronal function and improving patient outcomes in various neuroinflammatory conditions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Molecular pathology of anti-viral T cell responses in the central nervous system\" (PATHOCODE) seeks to deepen our understanding of the molecular interactions between non-cytolytic CD8+ T cells and neurons during viral infections of the CNS. Immune responses in the CNS are critical for controlling infections, but they can also contribute to neuronal damage and dysfunction. The central hypothesis of PATHOCODE is that non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions with neurons lead to inflammatory signaling, which in turn triggers metabolic and epigenetic alterations resulting in persistent neuronal dysfunction. \n\nThis project is structured around four core objectives: (1) to use single nucleus RNA sequencing to discern the vulnerabilities of specific neuronal subsets and differentiate between antigen-specific and bystander effects in the inflamed CNS, (2) to employ cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice to reveal the metabolic consequences of T cell engagement with neurons, (3) to utilize cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice to determine the impact of T cell interactions on the neuronal epigenome, and (4) to leverage CRISPR/Cas9 technology to potentially rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring disrupted metabolic pathways. \n\nThe expected outcome of PATHOCODE is to provide groundbreaking molecular insights into the immune-driven alterations of neurons during CNS inflammatory diseases. It promises to elucidate the complex landscape of immune-neuronal interactions and their pathological consequences, potentially leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to protect against and reverse neuronal dysfunction in viral-induced neuroinflammation.\n\nWord Count: 223",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, entitled \"Molecular pathology of anti-viral T cell responses in the central nervous system\" (PATHOCODE), seeks to advance our understanding of the molecular interactions between non-cytolytic CD8+ T cells and neurons during viral infections of the CNS. Immune responses in the CNS are a delicate balance, with the potential to cause severe and lasting damage to neural functions. The primary focus of PATHOCODE is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the engagement of non-cytolytic CD8+ T cells with neurons and to determine the resulting impacts on neuronal function and integrity.\n\nThe central hypothesis guiding this research posits that inflammatory signaling induced by non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell interactions triggers metabolic and epigenetic changes in neurons, leading to permanent neuronal dysfunction. To address this hypothesis, the project is structured around four key objectives: 1) To discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and differentiate between antigen-dependent and bystander effects using single nucleus RNA sequencing; 2) To uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism employing cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice; 3) To determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome using cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice; and 4) To rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways via CRISPR/Cas9 technology.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of PATHOCODE include the identification of novel molecular concepts regarding immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases. Understanding these processes at a molecular level has the potential to inform the development of targeted therapies aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of immune responses in the CNS, thereby improving outcomes for individuals afflicted by CNS viral infections and associated inflammatory conditions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nProject Title: Molecular Pathology of Anti-Viral T Cell Responses in the Central Nervous System (PATHOCODE)\n\nImmune responses against viral infections within the central nervous system (CNS) are critical for host defense but can also lead to severe neuropathological consequences. The PATHOCODE project aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which non-cytolytic CD8+ T cells interact with neurons and the subsequent impact on neuronal function. Our central hypothesis posits that this interaction stimulates inflammatory signaling, inducing metabolic and epigenetic changes that result in permanent neuronal dysfunction.\n\nTo validate our hypothesis and achieve our research aims, PATHOCODE is structured around four core objectives. First, we will discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and distinguish between antigen-dependent effects and bystander effects in the inflamed CNS through single nucleus RNA sequencing. Second, we will uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism using cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice. Third, we will determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome by employing cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice. Lastly, we aim to rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways via CRISPR/Cas9 technology.\n\nThe expected outcome of PATHOCODE is to provide novel molecular concepts about immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases. These insights have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the interplay between the immune system and neuronal function during viral infections and may open up new avenues for therapeutic interventions to mitigate the neurological damage associated with CNS inflammation."

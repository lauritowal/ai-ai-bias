        "Abstract:\n\nProject Title: Molecular Pathology of Anti-Viral T Cell Responses in the Central Nervous System (PATHOCODE)\n\nImmune responses against viral infections within the central nervous system (CNS) are critical for host defense but can also lead to severe neuropathological consequences. The PATHOCODE project aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which non-cytolytic CD8+ T cells interact with neurons and the subsequent impact on neuronal function. Our central hypothesis posits that this interaction stimulates inflammatory signaling, inducing metabolic and epigenetic changes that result in permanent neuronal dysfunction.\n\nTo validate our hypothesis and achieve our research aims, PATHOCODE is structured around four core objectives. First, we will discern neuronal subset-specific vulnerabilities and distinguish between antigen-dependent effects and bystander effects in the inflamed CNS through single nucleus RNA sequencing. Second, we will uncover the consequences of non-cytolytic T cell engagement on neuronal metabolism using cell-specific mitochondrial reporter mice. Third, we will determine how non-cytolytic T cell engagement affects the neuronal epigenome by employing cell-specific nucleus/ribosome reporter mice. Lastly, we aim to rescue T cell-mediated neuronal dysfunction by restoring metabolic pathways via CRISPR/Cas9 technology.\n\nThe expected outcome of PATHOCODE is to provide novel molecular concepts about immune-driven neuronal alterations in CNS inflammatory diseases. These insights have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the interplay between the immune system and neuronal function during viral infections and may open up new avenues for therapeutic interventions to mitigate the neurological damage associated with CNS inflammation."

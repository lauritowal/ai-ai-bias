        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal outlines the ambitions of the Prison Rights and the Law in Action (PRILA) project, which aims to forge the first comprehensive understanding of how the principles of rights protection, accountability, and adherence to the rule of law are operationalized within European prison systems. Recognizing that prisons are environments of pronounced power imbalances, PRILA seeks to investigate and document the actual experiences of prisoners and prison personnel, as well as the staff of oversight bodies, in relation to the frameworks designed to ensure fair and lawful treatment.\n\nThrough a novel approach that combines the theoretical lenses of public and prison law with the empirical scrutiny of human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, PRILA will employ a robust blend of legal analysis and social science methodologies. The project’s qualitative and quantitative research will provide a rich, multidimensional account of \"accountability work\" as encountered in daily life behind bars. This endeavor will critically reassess and expand existing narratives of penal power, legitimacy within prisons, and the tangible impacts of judicial review and administrative actions on the experience of incarceration.\n\nMoreover, PRILA will explore how accountability structures reflect broader penal philosophies and the nature of specific prison regimes. In doing so, it will offer new insights into the construction and practical application of judicial and legal concepts of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, scrutinizing their distinctiveness in a European context. The project's outcomes are expected to have a profound impact on policy-making and the enhancement of penal practices, ultimately contributing to the safeguarding of rule of law principles and human rights in the unique ecosystem of prisons. By illuminating the lived realities of these concepts, PRILA will provide vital knowledge to inform the development of more just and effective penal policies and practices across Europe."

Prisons are places where considerable power differentials exist, and are unique sites for the expression of the values which underpin public and prison law. Systems to ensure that prisoners are treated fairly and that rights are upheld are essential to ensure that imprisonment is conducted in ways that are just and promote good order. These are fundamental principles of the ‘European’ way in penal policy and penal law. Existing accounts of the deployment of penal power overlook key elements of how accountability, the rule of law, and rights are experienced. PRILA will document how prisoners, prison staff, staff of accountability bodies experience structures for ensuring decisions and actions taken in prison are fair, transparent, consistent, subject to appeal and review, and in compliance with principles of human rights. In doing so, PRILA will transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, judicial review of administrative action, the pains of imprisonment, and understandings of how penal power is experienced. Drawing on the disciplines of public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, the project will utilise legal, qualitative and quantitative research methods to create an account of how ‘accountability work’ is experienced. It will also examine how accountability structures are manifestations of penal ideologies or types of prison regimes. The project will advance current judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, by reference to how these concepts are experienced in practice, and examine whether and how they are distinctively ‘European’. The project will thereby support the creation of better penal policies and practices aimed at the protection of the rule of law and rights in the prison context.",

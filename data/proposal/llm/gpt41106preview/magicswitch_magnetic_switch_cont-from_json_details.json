        "Abstract:\n\nThe MAGIC-SWITCH project proposes the development of an innovative magnetic switch for data storage, controlled by voltage, that addresses the critical challenges of security threats and robustness in contemporary data storage systems. With 88 records lost or stolen every second as of 2017—an issue that is anticipated to worsen—the need for improved storage security is paramount. MAGIC-SWITCH envisions a transformative leap forward by creating a new type of storage memory, leveraging the scientific groundwork laid by the ERC Consolidator SPIN-PORICS project.\n\nThis novel storage solution harnesses magneto-ionic effects to enable secure storage and selective data visibility through voltage sequences. The envisioned prototype will have a starting Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3, with the objective of advancing to TRL 5. The project's ambitions encompass the development of the prototype, standardization of the manufacturing process, and the creation of a robust business case.\n\nMAGIC-SWITCH's potential applications are far-reaching, including the storage of sensitive healthcare data and encryption keys. The technology's ability to control data visibility provides an added layer of security, crucial for sensitive applications. This project not only focuses on technological advancement but also on the strategy for commercialization. The business case will describe the prototype, outline a plan for commercial exploitation, and include a pitch for partnerships and fundraising.\n\nBy achieving these goals, MAGIC-SWITCH aims to deliver a secure, robust, and commercially viable data storage system. Its success could redefine how sensitive information is stored and managed, providing an industrially scalable solution to one of the digital world's most pressing challenges. The project will thus contribute significantly to the fields of digital and cloud-based technologies, with a solid scientific foundation and an operation principle based on cutting-edge research.",
        "Abstract:\n\nWith the escalating threats to digital data security and an alarming rate of 88 records lost or stolen per second as of 2017—a number that is expected to rise annually—it is imperative to develop new, more secure data storage solutions. The proposed project, MAGIC-SWITCH: Magnetic Switch Controlled with Voltage, aims to address these critical challenges by creating a groundbreaking type of storage memory that leverages magneto-ionic effects to enable secure storage and controlled data visibility through voltage sequences.\n\nGrounded in the scientific foundations provided by the ERC Consolidator SPIN-PORICS, MAGIC-SWITCH seeks to enhance the robustness and security of data storage systems, notably for sensitive healthcare data and encryption keys. The project's vision is to advance the prototype, initially at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3, to a more mature TRL of 5. This progression will be achieved by focusing on prototype development, manufacturing process standardization, and the creation of a comprehensive business case.\n\nMAGIC-SWITCH's prototype will introduce an industrial-relevant scale secure storage memory with features that allow data visibility to be manipulated via a specific voltage sequence, exploiting the controlled magneto-ionic effects. This innovation not only provides enhanced security but also offers a unique approach to data storage that could revolutionize how sensitive information is safeguarded.\n\nThe project's goals are ambitious yet attainable and include the development of a secure storage memory, building of a functional prototype, achievement of an improved TRL, standardization of the manufacturing process, and the creation of a robust commercial business case. Additionally, the project will prepare a compelling pitch for partnerships and fundraising, ensuring a strong foundation for commercial exploitation.\n\nIn summary, MAGIC-SWITCH promises to deliver a transformative solution to the persistent and growing problem of data security, offering a novel and secure method for storing sensitive digital information with potential for wide-reaching implications in various industries.",
        "Abstract:\n\nProject Name: MAGIC-SWITCH: Magnetic Switch Controlled with Voltage\n\nThe MAGIC-SWITCH project aims to revolutionize data storage security and robustness through the development of a novel secure storage memory technology. With an alarming rate of 88 records lost or stolen every second, as reported in 2017, and an increasing trend in data breach incidents, there is a critical need for improved data protection. Our vision, inspired by the ERC Consolidator SPIN-PORICS, is to produce a prototype that harnesses magneto-ionic effects, enabling secure data storage with visibility control through a unique voltage sequence.\n\nThe initial technology readiness level (TRL) of the proposed storage memory is 3, with a target to reach TRL 5. Our prototype will demonstrate two key features: enhanced security for sensitive data storage and the ability to store encryption keys with controlled visibility. These features are particularly suited for high-stakes use cases, such as storing sensitive healthcare data and securing encryption keys.\n\nThe MAGIC-SWITCH project's goals are comprehensive and include the development of a storage memory prototype, standardization of the manufacturing process, and the creation of a robust business case. This case will encompass a description of the prototype, a commercial exploitation plan, and a pitch for partnerships and fundraising. Our commercialization strategy aims to scale the product to an industrial-relevant level, ensuring that the technology can be widely adopted and effectively protect data across various digital and cloud-based platforms.\n\nThe scientific foundation of the project is grounded in the principles of magneto-ionic effects, researched and developed under SPIN-PORICS. By leveraging this cutting-edge science, MAGIC-SWITCH will enhance the robustness and security of data storage systems, addressing current challenges and setting a new standard in the field. The successful completion of this project will not only mitigate security threats but also pave the way for innovative data storage solutions in the future."

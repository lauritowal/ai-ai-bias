        "Abstract:\n\nProject Name: MAGIC-SWITCH: Magnetic Switch Controlled with Voltage\n\nThe MAGIC-SWITCH project aims to revolutionize data storage security and robustness through the development of a novel secure storage memory technology. With an alarming rate of 88 records lost or stolen every second, as reported in 2017, and an increasing trend in data breach incidents, there is a critical need for improved data protection. Our vision, inspired by the ERC Consolidator SPIN-PORICS, is to produce a prototype that harnesses magneto-ionic effects, enabling secure data storage with visibility control through a unique voltage sequence.\n\nThe initial technology readiness level (TRL) of the proposed storage memory is 3, with a target to reach TRL 5. Our prototype will demonstrate two key features: enhanced security for sensitive data storage and the ability to store encryption keys with controlled visibility. These features are particularly suited for high-stakes use cases, such as storing sensitive healthcare data and securing encryption keys.\n\nThe MAGIC-SWITCH project's goals are comprehensive and include the development of a storage memory prototype, standardization of the manufacturing process, and the creation of a robust business case. This case will encompass a description of the prototype, a commercial exploitation plan, and a pitch for partnerships and fundraising. Our commercialization strategy aims to scale the product to an industrial-relevant level, ensuring that the technology can be widely adopted and effectively protect data across various digital and cloud-based platforms.\n\nThe scientific foundation of the project is grounded in the principles of magneto-ionic effects, researched and developed under SPIN-PORICS. By leveraging this cutting-edge science, MAGIC-SWITCH will enhance the robustness and security of data storage systems, addressing current challenges and setting a new standard in the field. The successful completion of this project will not only mitigate security threats but also pave the way for innovative data storage solutions in the future."

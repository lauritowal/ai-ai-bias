        "Abstract:\n\nThe MOORELIGHT project, titled \"Next-Generation Light Source: Driving plasmas to power tomorrow’s nanolithography,\" addresses a critical bottleneck in the production of advanced semiconductor devices: the efficiency of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) at a 13.5nm wavelength. Current EUVL systems utilize high-energy CO2-gas laser pulses interacting with molten tin microdroplets, a process that is hampered by low overall efficiency and an impractical power footprint — requiring a megawatt of input for every watt of EUV power produced. Our proposal aims to transform this landscape by replacing gas lasers with solid-state lasers, promising a substantial reduction in power footprint and a leap toward sustainable and scalable EUVL technology.\n\nDespite the potential, knowledge gaps remain, including the optimal laser wavelength and plasma recipe for the solid-state laser-driven process. To address these, MOORELIGHT's research objectives are threefold: First, we will develop capabilities for laser-tailoring targets to understand phase changes and fragmentation of laser-impacted liquid thin tin targets (Objective 1). Second, we aim to investigate the coupling of tailored targets to laser light with variable properties, seeking to produce an optimum plasma recipe for EUV light (Objective 2). Lastly, we will advance predictive plasma modeling by identifying the atomic origins of EUV light (Objective 3).\n\nThe expected impacts of MOORELIGHT are significant and varied, spanning individual fields of science and technology and combining to empower the EU's ambitions of achieving technological leadership in nanotechnology. Specifically, MOORELIGHT will enable sustainable power for future EUVL, fostering advancements in semiconductor manufacturing and related technologies. Through this project, we seek to deliver the indispensable insight necessary to propel EUVL into a new era of efficiency and sustainability, benefiting industry and science alike."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Precision dating of the Palaeolithic: chronological mapping of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic of Eurasia,\" seeks to establish a refined and reliable chronology for over 50 key Palaeolithic sites ranging from 60,000 to 30,000 years ago. The principal objective is to construct a robust timeline to enhance our understanding of critical events such as human dispersal out of Africa, the disappearance of Neanderthals, and the subsequent transition between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic periods.\n\nThe project will focus on a geographical scope spanning from Eastern Europe to Siberia, with a particular emphasis on regions within Russia and Central Asia. Utilizing a suite of advanced dating techniques—including Radiocarbon, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), Uranium-series (U-series), and Bayesian statistics—the project will address longstanding issues with radiocarbon dating, such as the difficulty of removing contaminants. A methodological innovation lies in the introduction of new chemical pretreatment methods, specifically the use of ultrafiltration for isolating bone proteins, which is expected to revolutionize the accuracy of radiocarbon dates.\n\nThe research team, led by a principal investigator (PI) with eight years of field experience, will draw on a collaborative network of experts to synthesize new data. Previous work by the team has already led to a significant revision in the chronology of the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in western Europe. Building on this foundation, the current proposal aims to further refine the chronological framework and provide an improved understanding of the environmental context in which these pivotal human evolutionary events occurred.\n\nExpected outcomes include a spatio-temporal framework that will offer new insights into the behavior and movements of both modern humans and Neanderthals, thereby contributing to a more nuanced narrative of human prehistory. By integrating methodological developments with empirical data, this project promises to be a transformative step in Palaeolithic research.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Precision dating of the Palaeolithic: chronological mapping of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic of Eurasia\" project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of prehistoric human history by constructing a robust chronology for over 50 key Palaeolithic sites across Eastern Europe and Siberia, covering the period from 60,000 to 30,000 years ago. This ambitious proposal aims to refine the timeline of significant events such as human dispersal out of Africa and Neanderthal disappearance by employing advanced dating techniques including Radiocarbon, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), Uranium-series (U-series), and Bayesian statistics.\n\nCentral to this project is the innovation of new chemical pretreatment methods, with a specific focus on ultrafiltration for bone proteins, to overcome issues associated with contaminants that have previously hampered radiocarbon dating accuracy. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize radiocarbon dating, as evidenced by the significant revision in the chronology of the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in western Europe over the past five years, resulting from the principal investigator's (PI) previous work.\n\nThe project will create a collaborative network leveraging the PI's 8 years of experience in the field. The geographical focus will be on northern Eurasia, with Russia and Central Asia being the primary application areas. By integrating methodological developments with expert analysis, the project is expected to yield new data that will improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal framework and environmental context of human evolution, dispersal, and interaction, including the co-existence and eventual extinction of Neanderthals.\n\nUltimately, this project will provide a comprehensive chronological map of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic of Eurasia, significantly advancing the field of Palaeolithic archaeology and contributing to a better understanding of our own species' formative history.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Precision dating of the Palaeolithic: chronological mapping of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic of Eurasia\" project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of human prehistory by reconstructing a precise chronology for the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition across Eurasia. This ambitious study revolves around the period from 60,000 to 30,000 years ago, a pivotal epoch that witnessed significant events such as modern human dispersal out of Africa and the disappearance of Neanderthals.\n\nThe project's core objective is to construct a robust chronology for over 50 key Palaeolithic sites located in Eastern Europe and Siberia. Through the application of advanced radiocarbon techniques, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), Uranium-series (U-series) dating, and Bayesian statistics, the project will address previous issues with radiocarbon dating, such as the difficulty of removing contaminants. A novel chemical pretreatment method, including ultrafiltration for the purification of bone proteins, will represent a significant methodological development.\n\nThe innovation in dating methods is expected to yield new data that will lead to a significant revision in the chronology of the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in western Europe, as has been demonstrated by the Principal Investigator's (PI) previous work over the past eight years. The enhanced chronological framework will improve our understanding of human evolution, dispersal, and interactions with Neanderthals within their environmental context.\n\nThis proposal emphasizes the collaborative network that will be engaged, encompassing expertise from various institutions and disciplines. The project will focus geographically on northern Eurasia, particularly Russia and Central Asia, thereby filling a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of human prehistory in these regions.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include the establishment of a spatio-temporal framework that situates human presence and activities within a well-resolved environmental context, thereby contributing to a more nuanced narrative of human history.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Precision dating of the Palaeolithic: Chronological mapping of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic of Eurasia\n\nThe proposed project endeavors to revolutionize our comprehension of human prehistory by meticulously constructing a robust chronology for over 50 key Palaeolithic sites spanning Eastern Europe to Siberia. Focused on the critical timeframe from 60,000 to 30,000 years ago—a period marked by significant human dispersal out of Africa and the enigmatic disappearance of Neanderthals—this research aims to generate a precise temporal framework to interrogate these fundamental anthropological events.\n\nEmploying a suite of advanced dating techniques, including refined radiocarbon methods, Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), Uranium-series (U-series), and Bayesian statistics, the project promises to address the longstanding challenges associated with radiocarbon contaminants. Innovations such as novel chemical pretreatment methods and the use of ultrafiltration for bone proteins are expected to revolutionize radiocarbon dating accuracy. The principal investigator (PI) brings a wealth of experience to this endeavor, with eight years of field experience and a proven track record of significantly revising the chronology of Western European Palaeolithic sites over the past five years.\n\nThe project's geographic focus will encompass Russia and Central Asia, with an emphasis on elucidating the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition. By targeting both modern human and Neanderthal sites, the research will illuminate patterns of co-existence, competition, and extinction within a detailed environmental context.\n\nThis collaborative network of experts will not only yield new data but also improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics that shaped early human history. The expected outcomes include establishing a spatio-temporal framework for human evolution, providing context for environmental changes, and refining the narrative of human and Neanderthal interactions during a pivotal epoch in our collective past."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research aims to enhance understanding of the economics governing the realm of information services by scrutinizing the strategic behaviors of agents involved in their production and dissemination. Recognizing the pivotal influence of externalities, the project investigates their burgeoning significance attributable to network effects, the non-exclusive nature of information, and the interdependency between information services and physical infrastructures.\n\nThe research is structured into four comprehensive sections: theoretical underpinnings, analysis of the virtual layer, examination of the physical layer, and implications for competition policy. The first segment is dedicated to constructing a theoretical framework employing innovative methodologies, including global and coordination games, as well as cutting-edge contract theory, to study market dynamics and contractual externalities.\n\nIn its second facet, the project delves into the intricacies of the virtual layer, examining the mechanics behind recommendation algorithms and the implications of privacy in information services. Empirical research on the transaction costs within e-commerce platforms, using exclusive transactional data, will provide insights into online market behaviors.\n\nThe third segment addresses the physical layer by evaluating net-neutrality and data pricing through the lens of price theory, considering the free-of-charge nature of certain services. It will also formulate dynamic investment models to comprehend the interplay between infrastructure and service innovation and the impact of existing systems.\n\nLastly, the research will contribute to the development of analytical tools designed to inform and guide competition policy for two-sided markets. By integrating theoretical advancements with empirical analyses, the project endeavors to offer a comprehensive perspective on the economic forces shaping the information services sector, ultimately aiding policymakers and industry stakeholders in navigating this complex landscape."

In this context, externalities play a key role explored by this proposal. Their increasing prevalence in information services can be traced to three features: - Many information services involve one-sided or two-sided network externalities. - Information is a public good and the production and exchange of information between two parties may affect other parties in a positive or negative manner. - Information services and physical infrastructures are complements. Externalities arise in the two layers of the information society, the content level and the physical infrastructure. The proposal is then organized around four parts: 1. Background theory: two-sided markets, network dynamics, contractual externalities 2. Virtual layer: recommendation systems, privacy, transaction costs 3. Physical layer: pricing , investment 4. Competition policy for two-sided markets The first part consists of the development of relevant theory with original and novel methods including for instance global games, coordination games and recent contract theory. The second part studies specific issues in information services such as the design of search engines and the right to privacy. It also includes empirical investigation of on-line transaction costs using proprietary data of transactions on e-commerce platforms. The third part is concerned with the infrastructure. It studies net-neutrality and the prices of data from the perspective of price theory, accounting for the gratuity of some services. It will also develop original dynamic investment models to understand the role of the complementarity between infrastructure and service innovation and the role of legacy. The last part will develop tools for competition policy makers.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Magma-Assisted Tectonics: Two-Phase Dynamics of Oceanic and Continental Rifts,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of plate tectonics by developing comprehensive models that treat magmatism as an integral component, rather than a mere by-product. Recognizing the central role of magmatism at divergent plate boundaries, this project is driven by the objective to elucidate the basic mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of continental rifts and mid-ocean ridges.\n\nBuilding on decades of meticulous observations of divergent boundaries, we aim to resolve outstanding issues by incorporating two-phase dynamics into our models. These models are characterized by the interaction of interpenetrating liquid and solid phases, governed by conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy, and a viscoelastic-plastic/frictional rheology. Our approach will enable us to accurately describe the conditions that lead to rock failure under tensile effective stress and the interaction between dikes and faults.\n\nThe project will validate its findings by performing comparative analyses with existing data, including surface deformation and relief, seismic tomography, and the geochemistry of lavas. These validation methods will ensure that the models reflect the complex realities of magma-assisted tectonic processes.\n\nCollaborations with research partners in key regions, such as the East African Rift System and the Juan de Fuca ridge, will enable the collection of invaluable field data, further strengthening the projectâ€™s outcomes. Additionally, the project will support mathematics education in Africa through outreach programs, emphasizing the global impact of the research.\n\nThe transformative potential of this project lies in its capacity to integrate magmatism into the dynamics of tectonic processes, thereby offering a comprehensive framework for understanding the thermal, chemical, and mechanical interactions that shape the Earth's lithosphere. The models developed will be made available as open-source resources, facilitating their widespread use and promoting further advancements in the field."

        "Abstract:\n\nCachexia is a debilitating syndrome characterized by massive loss of body weight, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, commonly observed in late stages of cancer and contributing to an alarming death rate of 25 percent among affected patients. Despite the syndrome's prevalence and severity, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed research, titled \"The Role of Lipolysis in the Pathogenesis of Cancer-associated Cachexia\" (CAC), aims to unravel the contribution of lipid metabolism to the pathogenesis of CAC by focusing on the enzymatic process of lipolysis.\n\nRecent findings indicate that adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a crucial enzyme in triacylglycerol catabolism, is essential for the pathogenesis of CAC. Mouse models deficient in ATGL are completely protected from the loss of adipose tissue and muscle typically associated with CAC. Building on this pivotal discovery, our study intends to investigate the regulation of tissue-specific lipolysis by various cancers in mice, elucidate the functional role of lipases and their coregulators, assess the impact of pharmacological inhibition of specific lipases on the prevention or delay of CAC, and study the effects of cancer-induced lipolysis on energy dissipating pathways and epigenetic control.\n\nThe research will be conducted through the characterization of induced mutant mouse models with CAC and in collaboration with experts in pathology and large-scale systems analytics. The expected outcomes are the identification of new mechanisms of disease development and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets that could prevent the dire consequences of CAC.\n\nThis project stands at the forefront of research into lipid metabolism's role in CAC pathogenesis and promises to provide significant advancements in the understanding and treatment of this life-threatening condition."

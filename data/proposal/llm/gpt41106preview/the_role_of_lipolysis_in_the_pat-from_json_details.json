        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Role of Lipolysis in the Pathogenesis of Cancer-associated Cachexia\n\nCachexia is a debilitating syndrome characterized by massive weight loss, adipose tissue depletion, and skeletal muscle wasting, commonly observed in the late stages of cancer and responsible for approximately 25% of cancer-related deaths. Despite its prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that lipase-catalyzed triacylglycerol (TG) catabolism, particularly through the action of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), is a pivotal process in CAC pathogenesis. Our research aims to dissect the role of lipolysis in CAC development and explore novel therapeutic strategies targeting this metabolic pathway.\n\nUsing induced mutant mouse models that lack ATGL, we have observed complete protection against the loss of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, indicating a potential avenue for intervention. This grant proposal seeks to: (1) Investigate the regulation of tissue-specific lipolysis by various cancers in mice; (2) Elucidate the functional role of lipases and their coregulators in the pathogenesis of CAC; (3) Assess the impact of pharmacological lipase inhibition on the prevention or delay of CAC; (4) Study the effects of cancer-induced lipolysis on energy dissipating pathways and epigenetic control mechanisms.\n\nOur multidisciplinary approach will involve characterization of mutant mouse models, collaboration with pathology and systems analytics experts, and integration of large-scale data analytics. We anticipate that our findings will unveil new mechanisms of disease development and identify novel therapeutic targets for preventing the severe consequences of CAC. This project represents a significant step towards understanding lipid metabolism's role in CAC pathogenesis, with the potential to improve the quality of life and survival rates for cancer patients suffering from this syndrome.",
        "Abstract:\n\nCancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a devastating syndrome characterized by a massive loss of body weight, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, which occurs in the late stages of cancer and contributes to approximately 25% of cancer-related deaths. Current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CAC remains poor, particularly in the context of lipid metabolism. Recent findings have implicated lipase-catalyzed triacylglycerol catabolism as a crucial process in CAC pathogenesis, with adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) playing a central role. Mouse models deficient in ATGL have shown complete protection from cachexia-associated tissue loss, suggesting a potential therapeutic target.\n\nOur project, \"The Role of Lipolysis in the Pathogenesis of Cancer-associated Cachexia,\" aims to investigate the causal role of lipolysis in CAC by focusing on the regulatory mechanisms of tissue-specific lipolysis by different cancers in mouse models, the functional role of lipases and coregulators in CAC pathogenesis, and the potential of pharmacological lipase inhibition to prevent or delay CAC. Additionally, we plan to study the broader effects of cancer-induced lipolysis on energy dissipating pathways and epigenetic control mechanisms.\n\nThe research will employ characterization of induced mutant mouse models with CAC and engage in collaborations with experts in pathology and large-scale systems analytics to provide comprehensive insights. Expected outcomes include identifying new mechanisms of disease development and novel therapeutic targets to mitigate the consequences of CAC.\n\nThrough this study, we aim to bridge the gap in knowledge regarding lipid metabolism in CAC pathogenesis and contribute substantially to the development of innovative treatment strategies that could improve the quality of life and survival rates of cancer patients afflicted by cachexia.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Role of Lipolysis in the Pathogenesis of Cancer-associated Cachexia\n\nCancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a devastating syndrome characterized by massive loss of body weight, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, leading to a significant increase in mortality, with approximately 25% of cancer patients succumbing to its consequences. The molecular mechanisms underlying CAC remain poorly understood, impeding the development of effective therapies. Recent findings implicate the critical role of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)-mediated triacylglycerol catabolism in CAC pathogenesis, with mouse models deficient in ATGL being protected from cachexia-induced tissue wasting.\n\nOur proposed research aims to enhance the understanding of lipid metabolism in CAC pathogenesis, focusing on the causal role of lipases and their coregulatory networks. We plan to investigate tissue-specific regulation of lipolysis by various cancers using induced mutant mouse models, elucidate the functional role of lipases and their coregulators, assess the therapeutic potential of pharmacological lipase inhibition, and explore the effects of cancer-induced lipolysis on energy dissipating pathways and epigenetic control.\n\nThis multidisciplinary project will employ characterization of mutant mouse models, collaborate with pathology experts, and utilize large-scale systems analytics to achieve our objectives. We anticipate that our findings will reveal new mechanisms of disease development and identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent or delay the consequences of CAC. By addressing this critical gap in knowledge, our study holds the potential to make significant strides towards improving the quality of life and survival rates of cancer patients suffering from cachexia.",
        "Abstract:\n\nCachexia is a debilitating syndrome characterized by massive loss of body weight, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle, commonly observed in late stages of cancer and contributing to an alarming death rate of 25 percent among affected patients. Despite the syndrome's prevalence and severity, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed research, titled \"The Role of Lipolysis in the Pathogenesis of Cancer-associated Cachexia\" (CAC), aims to unravel the contribution of lipid metabolism to the pathogenesis of CAC by focusing on the enzymatic process of lipolysis.\n\nRecent findings indicate that adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a crucial enzyme in triacylglycerol catabolism, is essential for the pathogenesis of CAC. Mouse models deficient in ATGL are completely protected from the loss of adipose tissue and muscle typically associated with CAC. Building on this pivotal discovery, our study intends to investigate the regulation of tissue-specific lipolysis by various cancers in mice, elucidate the functional role of lipases and their coregulators, assess the impact of pharmacological inhibition of specific lipases on the prevention or delay of CAC, and study the effects of cancer-induced lipolysis on energy dissipating pathways and epigenetic control.\n\nThe research will be conducted through the characterization of induced mutant mouse models with CAC and in collaboration with experts in pathology and large-scale systems analytics. The expected outcomes are the identification of new mechanisms of disease development and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets that could prevent the dire consequences of CAC.\n\nThis project stands at the forefront of research into lipid metabolism's role in CAC pathogenesis and promises to provide significant advancements in the understanding and treatment of this life-threatening condition."

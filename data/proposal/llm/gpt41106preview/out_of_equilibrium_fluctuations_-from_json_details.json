        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Out of Equilibrium Fluctuations in Confined Phase Transitions,\" aims to provide unprecedented experimental insights into the behavior of out of equilibrium fluctuations within strongly confined fluids near the critical point of a second order phase transition. This study will focus on the dynamics effects occurring when fluctuations are confined in a volume smaller than the spatial correlation length. It will explore the implications of these fluctuations, including the fluctuations of injected and dissipated power, and consider their potential as either a limiting factor or a useful phenomenon in various applications.\n\nOur strategy is to enhance the role of fluctuations and correlations by working close to the critical point, using a binary mixture of fluids or polymer blends. We will employ a combination of state-of-the-art experimental techniques including an original ultra-low noise Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) setup developed in our laboratory, near-field aperture-free light scattering, local and global dielectric techniques, and evanescent waves imaging. These methods will allow us to measure both local and global variables and to investigate phenomena such as finite size effects, dimensional crossover, the time-dependent critical Casimir effect, and the relaxation processes towards equilibrium after a quench at the critical point.\n\nGiven the universal nature of phase transitions, the results from this project are expected to have broad applicability, potentially informing the understanding of many other systems where measurements of fluctuations are more challenging. Our project will not only fill a gap in the experimental study of confined fluid fluctuations but also provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes at play, which could inform a range of scientific and technological fields.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, titled \"Out of Equilibrium Fluctuations in Confined Phase Transitions,\" aims to experimentally investigate the dynamics of out-of-equilibrium fluctuations in strongly confined fluids. This study is prompted by the critical need to understand the effects of confinement on the dynamics, power fluctuations, and the potential utility of such fluctuations in various applications. The research will particularly focus on confined fluids within volumes smaller than their spatial correlation lengths, an area where current understanding is limited.\n\nThe project's strategy is to enhance the understanding of the role played by fluctuations and correlations in the vicinity of the critical point of a second-order phase transition. The experimental work will concentrate on a critical point involving either a binary mixture of fluids or polymer blends, known for time scales and correlation lengths that are significantly longer than those of simple fluid mixtures.\n\nUsing a state-of-the-art ultra-low noise Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) developed in our laboratory, along with other innovative techniques such as near-field aperture-free light scattering, local and global dielectric measurements, and evanescent waves imaging, the research will provide unprecedented insights into phenomena such as finite size effects, dimensional crossover, time-dependent critical Casimir effect, and relaxation processes following a quench at the critical point.\n\nThe project's expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of local and global variables, the behavior of confined systems out of equilibrium, and the universal nature of phase transitions, which will have broad implications for other systems where direct measurements are challenging. The results will be instrumental in determining whether fluctuations in highly confined systems are a limiting factor or can be harnessed for practical applications.\n\nIn summary, this project promises to shed light on the fundamental aspects of phase transitions in confined systems and will contribute to the advancement of multiple scientific and technological fields where such phenomena are relevant.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative project titled \"Out of Equilibrium Fluctuations in Confined Phase Transitions.\" The project's primary aim is to experimentally study the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations in strongly confined fluids. These fluids are confined in a volume smaller than their spatial correlation length, presenting unique challenges in understanding their dynamics, power fluctuations, and potential applications. This research will address fundamental questions about whether fluctuations act as a limiting factor in confined systems and how they might be harnessed for practical use.\n\nThe research strategy is to enhance the role of fluctuations and correlations near the critical point of a second-order phase transition. The project will focus on the critical point of mixing, using binary mixtures of fluids or polymer blends. Our approach involves an innovative experimental setup that leverages an original ultra-low noise Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) developed in our laboratory, a near-field aperture-free light scattering technique, and both local and global dielectric techniques combined with evanescent waves imaging.\n\nWe expect to gain insights into phenomena such as finite size effects, dimensional crossover, time-dependent critical Casimir effect, and the relaxation process toward equilibrium after a quench at the critical point. Measurements of local and global variables will provide a comprehensive understanding of these phenomena.\n\nThe project builds upon previous theoretical and numerical investigations, addressing the gap in direct measurement of local fluctuations in confined fluids. The universal nature of phase transitions suggests that our findings will have broad implications, allowing for the application of our results to other systems where measurements are more complex.\n\nThis research promises to deliver significant contributions to the field of condensed matter physics, offering a deeper understanding of phase transitions in confined systems. It holds the potential to inform the development of new technologies and materials that exploit fluctuation phenomena at the nanoscale.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Out of Equilibrium Fluctuations in Confined Phase Transitions\n\nThe proposed research aims to experimentally study out of equilibrium fluctuations in strongly confined fluids, focusing on phenomena that occur when the confinement volume is smaller than the spatial correlation length. These systems exhibit unique dynamics and power fluctuations that raise fundamental questions regarding their implications on applications and potential usefulness. The project will employ an innovative strategy to enhance the understanding of fluctuations and correlations near the critical point of a second-order phase transition. \n\nA diverse array of materials including binary mixtures of fluids and polymer blends will be examined. Advanced experimental techniques, such as an original ultra low noise Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) developed in our laboratory, near field aperture free light scattering, local and global dielectric measurements, and evanescent waves imaging, will be utilized to investigate a broad spectrum of phenomena. These phenomena include finite size effects, dimensional crossover, time-dependent critical Casimir effect, and the relaxation process towards equilibrium after a quench at the critical point. \n\nThis multifaceted experimental approach is designed to provide insights into both local and global variables. Prior to this proposal, investigations into the direct measurement of local fluctuations in confined fluids have been limited, with most research being theoretical or numerical. This project seeks to fill that gap, providing valuable data for a variety of systems where phase transitions play a crucial role. Due to the universal nature of phase transitions, the results of this research are expected to have broad applicability, potentially impacting a range of fields where measurements are more challenging. This research strives to deepen our understanding of confined phase transitions, which may reveal innovative ways to harness these fluctuations in practical applications."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Out of Equilibrium Fluctuations in Confined Phase Transitions\n\nThe proposed research aims to experimentally study out of equilibrium fluctuations in strongly confined fluids, focusing on phenomena that occur when the confinement volume is smaller than the spatial correlation length. These systems exhibit unique dynamics and power fluctuations that raise fundamental questions regarding their implications on applications and potential usefulness. The project will employ an innovative strategy to enhance the understanding of fluctuations and correlations near the critical point of a second-order phase transition. \n\nA diverse array of materials including binary mixtures of fluids and polymer blends will be examined. Advanced experimental techniques, such as an original ultra low noise Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) developed in our laboratory, near field aperture free light scattering, local and global dielectric measurements, and evanescent waves imaging, will be utilized to investigate a broad spectrum of phenomena. These phenomena include finite size effects, dimensional crossover, time-dependent critical Casimir effect, and the relaxation process towards equilibrium after a quench at the critical point. \n\nThis multifaceted experimental approach is designed to provide insights into both local and global variables. Prior to this proposal, investigations into the direct measurement of local fluctuations in confined fluids have been limited, with most research being theoretical or numerical. This project seeks to fill that gap, providing valuable data for a variety of systems where phase transitions play a crucial role. Due to the universal nature of phase transitions, the results of this research are expected to have broad applicability, potentially impacting a range of fields where measurements are more challenging. This research strives to deepen our understanding of confined phase transitions, which may reveal innovative ways to harness these fluctuations in practical applications."

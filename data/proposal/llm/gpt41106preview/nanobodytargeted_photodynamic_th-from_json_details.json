        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Nanobody-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy to Kill Cancer\n\nThe proposed project aims to transform cancer treatment by exploiting the potential of nanobody-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT). Current photodynamic treatments face significant challenges, including non-specific targeting of cancer cells and prolonged photosensitivity in patients. This project seeks to overcome these limitations by harnessing the targeting capabilities of nanobodies—small, single-domain antibody fragments that can bind rapidly and specifically to cancer cells.\n\nThe primary goals of this innovative approach are to locally eradicate cancer and induce long-term immune protection. To achieve these goals, our team will focus on three main objectives: \n\n1. Development of novel nanobody-photosensitizer conjugates to increase accumulation of the photosensitizer in cancer cells, cancer stem cells, and endothelial cells. The efficacy of these conjugates will be rigorously tested in mice with human carcinoma xenografts.\n2. Investigation of immune system activation to determine whether nanobody-targeted PDT alone can provoke a systemic immune response, or if additional triggers are required. This will be critical for ensuring long-term protection against cancer recurrence.\n3. Clinical study of the proposed treatment’s effect in dogs with naturally occurring oral or colorectal cancers. Monitoring of cancer regression or disappearance in these subjects will provide invaluable data on the treatment's feasibility and potential for application in human cancer patients.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include scientific advancement in the field of nanobody-targeted PDT, elucidation of its mechanism of action, and the assessment of treatment feasibility in human cancer therapy. By improving cancer specificity and reducing patients’ photosensitivity, this project has the potential to significantly improve current cancer treatments and patient quality of life."

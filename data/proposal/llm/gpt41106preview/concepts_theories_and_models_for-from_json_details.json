        "Abstract:\n\nThe accelerating transition from vehicle ownership to Mobility as a Service (MaaS) presents an imperative need for comprehensive understanding and advanced modelling of the two-sided mobility market. Our proposed project, \"Concepts, theories and models for planning, operating and evaluating the dynamics of Mobility as a Service,\" aims to tackle this challenge by developing and testing innovative theories and models that encapsulate the transport network's complexities within this emerging domain.\n\nCentral to our objectives is the production of new behavioural models that encapsulate traveller and supplier choices, providing insights into their decision-making processes in transport marketplace settings. We plan to mathematically formalize the dynamic interplay between supply- and demand-side factors and to construct sophisticated network flow distribution and agent-based modelling frameworks. These models will facilitate the analysis of the co-evolution of market dynamics, including the identification of emerging patterns, transition phases, and the critical mass necessary for MaaS adoption and sustainable evolution.\n\nOur multifaceted methodological approach will integrate surveys, choice experiments, laboratory experiments, focus groups, interviews, and the rigorous analysis of observed behavioural data from on-demand services. This rich dataset will ensure the robustness and empirical validation of our models.\n\nThe expected outcomes of our work include theoretical and methodological breakthroughs in transport modelling, contributing fundamentally to the field of travel behaviour research. Additionally, we anticipate providing valuable insights into the dynamics of a two-sided mobility marketplace, thereby informing policy, planning, and operational strategies for MaaS. Our research promises to deliver a transformative understanding of the factors shaping the future of urban transportation, benefitting stakeholders, and end-users alike in the rapidly evolving landscape of mobility services."

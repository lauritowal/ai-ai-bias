        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Concepts, theories, and models for planning, operating and evaluating the dynamics of Mobility as a Service (MaaS),\" seeks to advance the understanding of transport networks within the burgeoning two-sided mobility market. Mobility as a Service represents a paradigm shift from individual vehicle ownership to comprehensive, on-demand mobility solutions, necessitating robust theoretical and empirical frameworks to guide its development.\n\nThe core objectives of this research program are to develop and test comprehensive theories and models of MaaS, formalize the interplay between supply and demand mathematically, and design advanced modelling frameworks including network flow distribution and agent-based models. These tools will enable the study of key phenomena such as emerging patterns, transition phases, critical mass in MaaS adoption, and conditions for economies of scale in market evolution.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the proposed methods encompass a mix of surveys, choice and laboratory experiments, analysis of observed behavioral data, focus groups, and interviews. These diverse methodological approaches will facilitate the estimation and validation of the proposed models, ensuring rigorous empirical grounding.\n\nThe expected contributions of this research are multifold. It promises theoretical and methodological breakthroughs in transport modeling, offering a deeper understanding of travel behavior in the context of two-sided mobility marketplaces. The insights gained will not only be academic in nature but will also have practical implications for the planning and operation of MaaS systems, ultimately influencing policy decisions and transportation strategies.\n\nBy funding this proposal, the grantor will support cutting-edge research that addresses the complexities of modern transportation systems and contributes to a more sustainable and efficient mobility future.",

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Concepts, Theories, and Models for Planning, Operating, and Evaluating the Dynamics of Mobility as a Service (MaaS)\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive research program aimed at advancing the understanding and effectiveness of Mobility as a Service (MaaS), a transformative approach in the transportation sector that shifts the focus from vehicle ownership to service-based mobility solutions. Recognizing the complexity of the two-sided mobility market, this project endeavors to develop, formalize, and test new theories and models that encapsulate the intricate dynamics of transport networks.\n\nThe core objectives of the proposed research are to generate and scrutinize behavioural models for both travellers and suppliers within MaaS settings, mathematically delineate the interplay between supply and demand, and to construct sophisticated network flow and agent-based models that can capture the co-evolution of these forces. By studying patterns, transition phases, and the concept of critical mass, the research aims to illuminate the conditions necessary for achieving economies of scale and fostering widespread adoption of MaaS.\n\nMethodologically diverse, the research will employ surveys, choice and laboratory experiments, data analysis from observed on-demand services, focus groups, and interviews to estimate and validate the proposed models. The anticipated contributions of the project include theoretical and methodological innovations in transport modelling, empirical enhancements to travel behaviour research, and deeper insights into the dynamics of two-sided mobility marketplaces.\n\nThe outcomes of this research promise to offer significant methodological and empirical contributions to the field of travel behaviour, bridging gaps in our current knowledge and providing policymakers and stakeholders with robust tools for planning and operating MaaS systems effectively. Through this research, we seek to lay the groundwork for a more sustainable and efficient transportation future, where mobility services are tailored to meet the evolving needs and preferences of society.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe accelerating transition from vehicle ownership to Mobility as a Service (MaaS) presents an imperative need for comprehensive understanding and advanced modelling of the two-sided mobility market. Our proposed project, \"Concepts, theories and models for planning, operating and evaluating the dynamics of Mobility as a Service,\" aims to tackle this challenge by developing and testing innovative theories and models that encapsulate the transport network's complexities within this emerging domain.\n\nCentral to our objectives is the production of new behavioural models that encapsulate traveller and supplier choices, providing insights into their decision-making processes in transport marketplace settings. We plan to mathematically formalize the dynamic interplay between supply- and demand-side factors and to construct sophisticated network flow distribution and agent-based modelling frameworks. These models will facilitate the analysis of the co-evolution of market dynamics, including the identification of emerging patterns, transition phases, and the critical mass necessary for MaaS adoption and sustainable evolution.\n\nOur multifaceted methodological approach will integrate surveys, choice experiments, laboratory experiments, focus groups, interviews, and the rigorous analysis of observed behavioural data from on-demand services. This rich dataset will ensure the robustness and empirical validation of our models.\n\nThe expected outcomes of our work include theoretical and methodological breakthroughs in transport modelling, contributing fundamentally to the field of travel behaviour research. Additionally, we anticipate providing valuable insights into the dynamics of a two-sided mobility marketplace, thereby informing policy, planning, and operational strategies for MaaS. Our research promises to deliver a transformative understanding of the factors shaping the future of urban transportation, benefitting stakeholders, and end-users alike in the rapidly evolving landscape of mobility services."

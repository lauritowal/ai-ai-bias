        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: PARENTAL TIME INVESTMENTS AND INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF INEQUALITY\n\nThe project PARENTIME seeks to address critical gaps in our understanding of the intergenerational transmission of inequality by focusing on the nuanced aspects of parental time investments and their long-term effects on child outcomes. Despite considerable research, the mechanisms through which parental time shapes the socio-economic trajectory of children remain insufficiently mapped, largely due to data limitations and narrow theoretical frameworks that have historically focused on the quantity of parental time without adequately considering its quality and context.\n\nThis proposal aims to develop innovative socio-economic theories that unravel the complex interaction between parental time investments and the subsequent development of human capital in children. Employing a theoretically-driven Big Data approach, PARENTIME will integrate large-scale, representative 24-hour diary survey data with comprehensive administrative datasets to analyze not just the amount, but the timing, sequence, and context of parental involvement in children's lives. The project will investigate the co-presence and multitasking during parent-child interactions, as well as the instantaneous enjoyment parents derive from child-rearing activities.\n\nBy capturing a comprehensive set of child human capital measures and tracing effects into adulthood, the research will explore how high socio-economic status parents give rise to children with similar status, thereby perpetuating cycles of inequality. The ultimate goal is to close the knowledge gap in literature by elucidating the mechanisms behind the intergenerational transmission of human capital, thus informing policies aimed at mitigating socio-economic disparities.\n\nPARENTIME promises to coordinate a scientific approach ranging from the micro-sequential level to a macro understanding of socio-economic inequality reproduction, contributing to a more equitable society by informing interventions that can disrupt the enduring patterns of inequality."

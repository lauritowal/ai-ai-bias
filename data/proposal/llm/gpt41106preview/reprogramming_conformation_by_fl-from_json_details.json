        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Reprogramming Conformation by Fluorination: Exploring New Areas of Chemical Space\n\nDespite the limited natural occurrence of organofluorine compounds, with only 12 known examples, their presence in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals is substantial, constituting around 40% of such materials. Current fluorination strategies, such as perfluorination and single-site fluorination, typically yield achiral, two-dimensional chemical structures. However, the synthesis of stereochemically defined, multiply fluorinated systems presents significant challenges, including the necessity for substrate pre-functionalization via oxidation, difficulties associated with competing substitution/elimination reactions, and the loss of enantiopurity during the synthesis of optically active fluorides.\n\nOur project, \"Reprogramming Conformation by Fluorination,\" aims to overcome these obstacles and facilitate exploration of three-dimensional, chiral chemical space. By utilizing simple feedstock and inexpensive, commercially available fluoride sources, we propose a novel approach to access multiply fluorinated, stereochemically complex organofluorine materials. Our methodology promises to provide a modular platform for the rational placement of functional groups and accelerate the discovery of next-generation materials.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the development of new modular platforms for functional placement on a structural basis and the accelerated discovery of novel materials. This research holds potential applications across various disciplines, including medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, material sciences, and bio-medicine, paving the way for innovative solutions in these fields.\n\nThrough this grant proposal, we seek to address the disparity between the prevalence of organofluorine compounds in functional molecules and the synthetic challenges they present, proposing a solution that will enable the exploration of new and uncharted chemical spaces."

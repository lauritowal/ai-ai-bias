        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal requests funding for \"The 15th-century Book Trade: An Evidence-based Assessment and Visualization of the Distribution, Sale, and Reception of Books in the Renaissance,\" a groundbreaking historical research initiative. Leveraging substantial material and documentary evidence, including thousands of extant 15th-century books and a detailed unpublished ledger of a Venetian bookseller from the 1480s that records 25,000 book sales with prices, this project aims to unearth the intricacies of the early printing trade and the spread of printed works in the West.\n\nWith objectives to examine the distribution and trade-routes of printed books, identify the demographics and professions of buyers and users, assess the contemporary market value, study the transmission and dissemination of texts, analyze the survival and loss of texts, and investigate the circulation and re-use of illustrations, the research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the 15th-century book trade.\n\nThe methods will include tracking the circulation of books and trade routes, collecting data across Europe and the USA, using an internationally-utilized database developed from a British Academy pilot project, and applying scientific visualization techniques to represent the geographical and chronological movement of books and texts.\n\nExpected outcomes of the project are to create a visual representation of the movement of 15th-century printed books and texts, offering insights into historical reading practices, book valuation, and the spread of knowledge during the Renaissance. This will significantly contribute to the field of historical book trade studies, providing an unprecedented evidence-based assessment of the book trade in the 15th century.\n\nThis project builds on the success of the previous British Academy pilot project and aims to enhance the existing database for 15th-century printed books, thus preserving and presenting a vital part of cultural heritage through advanced scientific visualization techniques."

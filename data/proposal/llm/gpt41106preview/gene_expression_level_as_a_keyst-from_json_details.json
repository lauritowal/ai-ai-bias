        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Gene expression level as a keystone to understanding gene duplication: evolutionary constraints, opportunities, and disease,\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of the role of gene duplication in evolutionary biology and disease pathogenesis. The current paradigm, which assumes that gene duplication events relieve selective constraints and that redundant genes are neutral in function, is challenged by our proposal. We hypothesize that the resolution of gene expression levels is critical for explaining the contrasting evolutionary trajectories that result from gene-by-gene duplications and whole genome duplications (WGD).\n\nOur objectives include revealing the complex relationship between gene duplication and expression levels, testing a model where the indirect costs of gene expression are a major determinant of the outcome of gene duplication, exploring the effects on gene and genome evolution, and linking patterns of gene expression and duplicability to pathogenic effects. We propose a comprehensive computational and statistical analysis of high-quality genomics data to achieve these goals. \n\nThe project's significance lies in its potential to elucidate the biased nature of the duplication process, where non-essential genes are more likely to duplicate, and genes retained after WGD are typically important and slowly evolving. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate that co-evolution of gene expression post-WGD can lead to the evolution of new biochemical pathways and protein complexes, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism for many duplication events, independent of the biochemical function of the encoded genes.\n\nBy challenging previous assumptions such as \"a duplicate is a duplicate is a duplicate\" and the notion of gene knockout neutrality due to redundancy, our research will provide novel insights into the importance of gene expression levels in shaping the evolutionary landscape and contributing to disease. The availability of abundant, high-quality genomics data presents an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of these critical biological processes."

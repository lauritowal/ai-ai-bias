        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"The physics of Earthquake faulting: learning from laboratory earthquake prediCTiON to Improve forecasts of the spectrum of tectoniC failure modes: TECTONIC\" (TECTONIC) project aims to advance earthquake forecasting capabilities by bridging the gap between laboratory findings and field data through the integration of machine learning techniques. Despite the progress made in laboratory settings, wherein clear and consistent precursors to earthquake events have been identified and lab earthquakes have been predicted, the current state of forecasting suffers from a lack of reliable observations and a difficulty in extrapolating lab results to real-world tectonic faults.\n\nThe TECTONIC project proposes a multi-faceted approach to address these challenges. By connecting laboratory results with field observations and employing machine learning algorithms to search for earthquake precursors, the project seeks to build predictive models that will enhance the understanding of tectonic faulting. The expected outcomes include modest but significant improvements in earthquake forecasting that could save thousands of lives and prevent billions of euros in economic losses.\n\nTo realize these goals, the project will require support for the acquisition and analysis of seismic and geodetic data, as well as the construction of new laboratory equipment to investigate the physics of earthquake precursors. The team, with expertise in earthquake source theory, machine learning, fault rheology, and geodesy, is also committed to training the next generation of researchers in earthquake science and fostering a new level of broad community collaboration.\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the need for a comprehensive research strategy that leverages recent laboratory advances and machine learning to improve earthquake forecasting methods, with the ultimate aim of safeguarding human lives and infrastructure from the destructive force of earthquakes.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe TECTONIC project aims to revolutionize earthquake forecasting by integrating laboratory findings with machine learning to predict tectonic failure modes. Despite the substantial impact of earthquakes, as exemplified by the significant events in Amatrice and Norcia, Italy in 2016, current forecasting efforts are hampered by a lack of reliable observations and a limited understanding of the physics involved in tectonic faulting. This proposal addresses these challenges by proposing a multifaceted approach to improve the modest forecasting capabilities.\n\nRecent laboratory advances have shown clear and consistent precursors to seismic activity, and machine learning has successfully predicted laboratory earthquake failure times and magnitudes. The TECTONIC project seeks to expand upon these advances by connecting laboratory results with field observations, using machine learning to identify and analyze earthquake precursors, and building predictive models for a range of fault slip modes.\n\nThe project requires support for the acquisition and analysis of seismic and geodetic data, as well as the construction of new, specialized laboratory equipment. A team with a strong background in earthquake source theory, fault rheology, geodesy, and machine learning will work towards achieving the research goals of understanding earthquake precursor physics and observing conditions for tectonic faults. Furthermore, the project has the dual goals of training the next generation of researchers in earthquake science and fostering a new level of broad community collaboration.\n\nBy leveraging cutting-edge technology and interdisciplinary expertise, the TECTONIC project has the potential to save thousands of lives and prevent billions of euros in economic losses by advancing the field of earthquake forecasting. The research focus not only promises to enhance our ability to forecast earthquakes but also contributes to the broader understanding of tectonic processes that shape our planet.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The physics of Earthquake faulting: learning from laboratory earthquake prediCTiON to Improve forecasts of the spectrum of tectoniC failure modes: TECTONIC,\" aims to significantly advance our ability to forecast earthquakes. Despite recent progress in identifying consistent precursors to laboratory-induced seismic events and employing machine learning to predict their timing and magnitude, the application of these findings to real-world tectonic faults remains a formidable challenge due to the lack of reliable observations and the difficulty in scaling laboratory results.\n\nThe project's principal objectives are to improve earthquake forecasting capabilities, bridge the gap between laboratory and field observations, utilize machine learning to detect earthquake precursors, and develop predictive models for various tectonic faulting scenarios. The importance of this research cannot be overstated, as it holds the promise to save thousands of lives and prevent economic losses amounting to billions of euros.\n\nTo achieve these goals, the project will involve the acquisition and analysis of seismic and geodetic data, as well as the construction of new laboratory equipment tailored to earthquake physics research. The proposal also emphasizes training the next generation of researchers in earthquake science and fostering a new level of broad community collaboration in this field.\n\nThe research team brings a wealth of expertise, with backgrounds in earthquake source theory, machine learning, fault rheology, and geodesy. By leveraging recent advances in laboratory earthquake precursors and predictive modeling via machine learning, the TECTONIC project proposes a multidisciplinary approach that holds the potential to transform our understanding of earthquake dynamics and significantly enhance our forecasting capabilities.\n\nThrough this proposal, the research team seeks support for their innovative efforts to unravel the complex physics of earthquake precursors and develop robust forecasting models that could ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in earthquake preparedness and risk mitigation strategies.",

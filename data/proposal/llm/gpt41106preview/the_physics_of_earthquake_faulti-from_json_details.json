        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal titled \"The physics of Earthquake faulting: learning from laboratory earthquake prediCTiON to Improve forecasts of the spectrum of tectoniC failure modes: TECTONIC\" aims to enhance earthquake forecasting capabilities through a multidisciplinary approach that bridges laboratory findings with field observations. This initiative is driven by the imperative to save lives and mitigate economic losses by addressing the current challenges in earthquake prediction, which include the lack of reliable lab or field observations and the difficulty in extrapolating lab results to tectonic faults.\n\nRecent advances have yielded clear and consistent precursors to lab earthquakes and breakthroughs in the prediction of lab earthquake failure time and magnitude using machine learning. The project seeks to capitalize on these advances by connecting lab results with field observations and using machine learning to search for earthquake precursors. This approach will facilitate the development of predictive models for tectonic faulting, significantly improving our ability to forecast earthquakes.\n\nThe scope of the project encompasses the acquisition and analysis of seismic and geodetic data, as well as the construction of new lab equipment designed for the study of earthquake physics. The research team, with a strong background in earthquake source theory, machine learning, fault rheology, and geodesy, sets forth the following objectives: to improve earthquake forecasting capabilities, to observe conditions leading to tectonic faults, and to forecast the spectrum of fault slip modes using machine learning.\n\nFurthermore, the project will contribute to the training of the next generation of researchers in earthquake science and foster a new level of broad community collaboration. The anticipated outcomes of TECTONIC are modest yet significant improvements in earthquake forecasting, which could translate into saving thousands of lives and preventing billions of euros in economic damage. This proposal will support the acquisition and analysis of key data and the construction of innovative lab equipment to unravel the complex physics behind earthquake precursors and forecasts."

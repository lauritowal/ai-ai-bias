        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"High-resolution and chemical genetic approaches to RNA silencing mechanisms,\" aims to elucidate the complex roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in eukaryotic organisms, with a specific focus on miRNAs and siRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Small RNAs are pivotal in regulating cell differentiation, development, hormonal responses, and defense mechanisms, and their dysregulation can lead to severe consequences, such as cancer. The project centers on the miRNA effector protein ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1), a key player in RNA silencing pathways.\n\nEmploying cutting-edge technologies such as single-cell forward genetics, protein purification, and RNA/polysome profiling, our goals are to establish a functional spatiotemporal map of the AGO1-sRNAome within the root system of Arabidopsis and to identify cell-specific modifiers of sRNA biogenesis and action. This high-resolution approach will enable the dissection of RNA silencing mechanisms at both single-cell and subcellular levels.\n\nA novel aspect of this research is the integration of chemical genetics to isolate small molecules that can manipulate AGO1-dependent sRNA pathways in planta. This strategy promises to accelerate both forward and reverse genetic approaches to understanding RNA silencing and will potentially uncover novel connections between miRNA/siRNA pathways and physiological or metabolic responses.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will have broad implications for improving our understanding of cell identity and stress adaptation in plants, providing insights that could be translated into agricultural applications for crop improvement and stress resistance. Furthermore, the conservation of sRNA pathways across species means that discoveries made in Arabidopsis could inform therapeutic strategies for human diseases associated with RNA silencing defects."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Breaking Oncometabolites Dynamics for Next-Generation Dendritic Cells Tumor Immunotherapy\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to revolutionize the field of tumor immunotherapy by exploiting the intricate relationship between the Tumor MicroEnvironment (TME) and immune cell metabolism. Our focus is on the role of oncometabolitesâ€”the metabolic by-products that can dampen antitumor immune responses and contribute to therapy resistance. Central to our hypothesis is the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a pivotal sensor within immune cells that influences the outcome of immune reactions against tumors by interacting with metabolites in the TME.\n\nWe aim to identify AhR-activating metabolites and investigate their impact on tumor rejection or progression. Our objectives are to decipher the TME's communication with immune cells via AhR and to develop innovative strategies to inhibit AhR or AhR-dependent programs in dendritic cells, a class of antigen presenting cells (APCs) crucial for inducing tumor-specific immune responses. By selectively deleting AhR in APCs, we anticipate triggering the rejection of aggressive tumors such as fibrosarcoma.\n\nEmploying state-of-the-art technologies, including advanced single-cell analysis, promoter gene-editing approaches, and computational chemistry, this research will provide insights into metabolites as potential predictors of immune activation or suppression within the TME. Furthermore, we plan to identify and target immune suppressive oncometabolites as druggable targets to inhibit tumor escape mechanisms, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this study are profound, with the promise of metabolites serving not only as biomarkers but also as novel targets for immunotherapeutic strategies. With a high degree of translatability to human cells, our research stands to significantly impact the development of next-generation immunotherapies, offering hope for patients facing tumors that are currently resistant to conventional treatments."

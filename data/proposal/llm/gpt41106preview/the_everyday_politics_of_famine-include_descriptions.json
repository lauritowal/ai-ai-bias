        "**Abstract:**\n\nDespite significant advancements in humanitarian efforts, the incidence of famine remains alarmingly high, with devastating impacts on vulnerable populations. The persistent nature of famine, despite a scholarly consensus attributing its occurrence to political rather than natural causes, suggests a gap in our understanding of famine dynamics at the community level. This proposed research seeks to examine the everyday politics of famine within affected communities, challenging the conventional focus on national and international actors and their strategic use of famine. Specifically, the project will investigate the normalization of catastrophic famines and the discursive shifts that deflect accountability from political entities to victims and natural phenomena.\n\nThe study will employ an ethnographic comparative methodology across four distinct sites in South Sudan and Somalia. The research is structured around four thematic strands: historical and musical recollections of previous famines, community narratives that underpin social cohesion, practices surrounding burial and the deceased, and the influence of media on famine politics. These strands will provide a multifaceted understanding of how famine is experienced, remembered, and addressed within communities, as well as how these local narratives interact with broader political discourses.\n\nThis research is poised for success due to the principal investigator's extensive experience, established networks in the region, and the formation of a robust team, primarily comprising Somali and South Sudanese researchers. By delving into the micro-politics of famine and its sociocultural dimensions, the project aims to contribute a novel perspective to the field of famine studies and to promote the development of political cultures that render famine politically intolerable, thereby contributing to its eradication."

For decades there has been a scholarly consensus that famine is the result of political failure or design, and never solely the result of natural disasters. However, a political culture that makes famine politically unconscionable and that ends famine has not emerged. To understand why famines persist we need to deepen our understanding of famine politics; so far scholarship on the politics of famine has focus on national and international institutions, and the instrumental use of famine by actors and institutions. My research will produce a ground-breaking shift in the science of famine politics by focusing on the everyday politics of famine in communities where it occurs. I am interested in how discourses and the ‘regime of truth’ about famine disperse throughout the social body (in Foucault’s words). In particular, I am interested in how new deadly famines come to be normalised, preventing political rupture. Plus, I am interested in how these discourses can shift blame for famine suffering away from governments, warring parties and actors in global economies, and instead place blame on natural causes and the families of those who suffer and die. To achieve this, I will conduct an ethnographically-informed comparative study across four sites in South Sudan and in Somalia. Initial ethnographic insights have made me structure the research around four cross-case-study research strands: histories and musical memories of past famine; community-narratives that enforce social networks; burial and posthumous practices; and media and social media’s role in anti-famine politics. This ambitious project is feasible because of my previous experience and networks, and because I have carefully built the capacity and track record of a team Somali and South Sudanese – dominated research team.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Biological Origins of Linguistic Constraints,\" seeks to investigate the uniquely human capacity for language by examining the biological constraints that underpin language acquisition and processing. The project will explore how humans are able to express and comprehend an infinite number of ideas using a finite set of linguistic elements, a capability not observed in other species. The research will bridge the disciplines of Psychology, Linguistics, Biology, Philosophy, and Cognitive Neuroscience.\n\nThe study aims to identify the components of language that are inherently human, including the ease with which infants grasp linguistic structure, as well as to determine the shared features, such as powerful learning mechanisms and basic perceptual abilities, found across species. By comparing human adults and infants with nonhuman animals, the research intends to understand the interplay between general mechanisms shared across species and specialized ones for speech signal processing.\n\nUsing a wide array of experimental techniques, the project will test the hypothesis that differences between humans and other species may stem from the distinct cues utilized within the language signal to extract information, rather than an innate capacity to process complex language structures. The goal is to delineate the shared biological constraints that influence language acquisition and to challenge the research debate surrounding the general versus specialized nature of language processing mechanisms.\n\nThe expected outcome of the research is to provide significant insight into what aspects of language are uniquely human and what aspects are shared across different animal species. This knowledge will have profound implications for our understanding of the evolution of language and the cognitive underpinnings of linguistic abilities."

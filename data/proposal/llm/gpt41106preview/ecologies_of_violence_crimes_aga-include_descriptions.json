        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe escalating degradation of our planet's ecosystems prompts urgent inquiries into the dynamics of blame and remembrance for both human and non-human entities affected by environmental destruction. The proposed project, EcoViolence, aims to be the inaugural comprehensive, transnational, and comparative exploration into the cultural imagination surrounding environmental harm. As contemporary artists, writers, and filmmakers grapple with the daunting task of representing large-scale ecological crises such as ecocide and extinction, they often draw upon narrative and aesthetic frameworks originally developed to process historical atrocities like the Holocaust and slavery. This adaptation of repertoires highlights the interconnections between crimes against humanity and the natural world.\n\nEcoViolence intends to bridge the gap between cultural memory studies and ecocriticism to forge a novel ecological approach to analyzing depictions of violence. The research will meticulously catalogue and interpret the ways in which various media—literature, cinema, visual arts, theater, and exhibitions—portray environmental violence, scrutinize its association with colonialism and genocide, and contemplate the intricate themes of culpability and accountability. It will also investigate how these cultural expressions mobilize emotions and affect to foster personal connections to the ecological crisis and stimulate critical self-awareness among audiences.\n\nBy redefining the intersection of violence and memory within an ecological context, EcoViolence aspires to realign both cultural memory research and ecocriticism. The outcome of this study will be instrumental in developing a guide for best practices in educational settings, promoting nuanced critical literacy concerning environmental violence. This guide will aim to transcend the binary narratives of victimhood and perpetration, which have historically hindered comprehensive engagement with our shared responsibility in the face of ongoing ecological devastation."

How do we remember the victims, both human and non-human? And who is to blame? Contemporary culture plays a crucial role in addressing these questions. Large-scale processes like ecocide and extinction pose significant conceptual and representational challenges. This project posits that writers, artists and filmmakers are responding to these challenges by adapting existing repertoires, especially ones that emerged in response to the Holocaust, slavery, and other atrocities. In so doing they reveal the historical, structural and discursive links between crimes against humanity and crimes against nature. EcoViolence will be the first comprehensive, transnational, comparative study of the cultural imaginary of environmental violence. Bringing together recent work in cultural memory studies and ecocriticism, we will develop an innovative ecological model for the study of violence and its representation. We will document how texts, films, art works, plays and exhibitions represent ecoviolence; map how they link it to colonialism and genocide; and analyse how they reflect on questions of guilt and responsibility, as well as culture’s own implication in the violence it depicts. Furthermore, we will explore how these representations harness affect and emotion to help people relate to the environmental crisis and promote critical self-reflection. EcoViolence will effect a major reorientation in cultural memory research and ecocriticism by providing a framework to think about violence and memory in more-than-human terms. The project will result in a “best practices” guide to engage cultural representations in pedagogy to enhance critical literacies about ecoviolence and move beyond simplistic stories where everyone is either a victim or a perpetrator that have stifled full responses to our collective ecocidal trajectories.",

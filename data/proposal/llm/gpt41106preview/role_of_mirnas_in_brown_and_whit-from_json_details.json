        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Role of miRNAs in Brown and White Adipose Tissue Differentiation and Function\n\nThis grant proposal focuses on the significant role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the differentiation and functional regulation of brown (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), vital components in the body's energy balance and metabolic regulation. While WAT is primarily involved in storing energy as triglycerides and maintaining whole body homeostasis, BAT is responsible for lipid catabolism and thermogenesis. Dysregulation of these adipose tissues leads to metabolic disorders such as ectopic lipid storage and severe pathology, whereas increased BAT activity is associated with a lean and healthy phenotype through heightened energy expenditure without affecting other tissues.\n\nThe overarching goal of our research is to identify miRNAs and other factors that are crucial in regulating BAT and WAT differentiation and function. We aim to (1) distinguish miRNAs that are specifically involved in brown or white adipogenesis and expressed in their respective precursors, (2) establish miRNA expression signatures for either cell type, and (3) elucidate the molecular mechanisms of miRNAs in the regulation of adipose tissue differentiation and metabolism. Additionally, we seek to investigate the origin of beige cells within subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and their importance in metabolic regulation in vivo.\n\nTo achieve our objectives, we will utilize both in vitro and in vivo systems, including lineage tracing studies, the use of transgenic animals, and cohorts of human patients. This approach will allow us to develop strategies to induce BAT differentiation and function and discover methods to silence miRNAs exclusively in brown fat, with the potential to treat metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity.\n\nOur proposal promises to provide groundbreaking insights into adipose tissue biology and pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches targeting metabolic diseases, thus having a far-reaching impact on public health."

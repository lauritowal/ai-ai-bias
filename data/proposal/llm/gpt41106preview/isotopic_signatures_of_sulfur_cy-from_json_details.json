        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Isotopic Signatures of Sulfur Cycling Organism Physiology and Ecology,\" seeks to fundamentally advance our understanding of sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) isotope fractionations associated with sulfur metabolism and their preservation in geological records through diagenesis. At the heart of this proposal is the development and application of metabolic-isotopic models (MIMs) that are experimentally validated and capable of interpreting the complex isotopic signals found in sedimentary compounds such as pyrite and carbonate-associated sulfate.\n\nCurrent limitations in the field include overly simplified models of isotopic fractionation in dissimilatory sulfur metabolism and challenges in accounting for the heterogeneous nature of diagenesis. Our approach is to construct a hierarchy of MIMs that increase in dimensionality and sophistication, capturing the nuances of biochemical reactions, physical processes, and enzymatic reactions that influence isotope fractionation.\n\nThe project will focus on key sulfur metabolisms, including sulfate reduction, reduced sulfur oxidation, and sulfur disproportionation. By embedding these MIMs into ecosystem models and validating them against microfluidic experiment results and environmental data, we aim to uncover the controls on multi-isotope fractionation and their heterogeneous manifestation in both aqueous and solid compounds. This will enable robust interpretation of isotopic compositions and provide insights into microenvironmental conditions and depositional parameters across microscopic to global scales, in both modern and ancient settings.\n\nThe broader implications of this work include the potential for similar treatment of isotopic composition in other natural materials, thereby opening new avenues for probing biogeochemical cycles. Ultimately, the project promises to deliver a transformative framework for interpreting sulfur cycling in Earth's history, with applications that extend beyond the realm of sulfur to advance our understanding of the Earth system as a whole."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Isotopic Signatures of Sulfur Cycling Organism Physiology and Ecology\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) isotope fractionation related to sulfur cycling processes. The central goal is to develop robust metabolic-isotopic models (MIMs) that can interpret isotopic signals from sedimentary compounds such as pyrite and carbonate-associated sulfate. These models will be validated through microfluidic experiments and environmental data to provide insights into the controls on multi-isotope fractionation during sulfate reduction, reduced sulfur oxidation, and sulfur disproportionation.\n\nCurrent models of isotopic fractionation in dissimilatory sulfur metabolisms are simplified and often fail to capture the complexity of diagenesisâ€”a physical process that alters the geochemical signatures in sedimentary environments. By incorporating a hierarchy of model sophistication and dimensionality that encompasses thermodynamics, kinetics, and enzymatic reactions, this proposal seeks to address these shortcomings. The proposed MIMs will be applied across microscopic to global scales and in both modern and ancient settings, allowing for a deeper understanding of microenvironmental conditions and depositional parameters that influence isotope fractionation.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will not only elucidate the controls on sulfur metabolism and the heterogeneous manifestation of isotope fractionation in both aqueous and solid compounds but also provide a framework for the utilization of isotopic compositions to probe sulfur cycling. Furthermore, the approach has the potential for similar treatment of isotopic composition in other natural materials, enhancing its applicability beyond the scope of sulfur isotope geochemistry. This innovative study holds the promise of advancing our ability to interpret the complex history of sulfur cycling throughout Earth's history, providing critical insights into past and present biogeochemical cycles.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Isotopic Signatures of Sulfur Cycling Organism Physiology and Ecology,\" seeks to deepen scientific understanding of sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) isotope fractionations that occur during sulfur cycling processes. The project aims to address the limitations of current isotopic fractionation models in dissimilatory S metabolisms and the challenges of capturing the heterogeneous nature of diagenesis in existing models. By developing and applying new metabolic-isotopic models (MIMs), the study will provide insights into the metabolic isotope fractionation associated with sulfate reduction, reduced S oxidation, and S disproportionation. These MIMs will be progressively advanced in dimensionality and sophistication, integrating thermodynamics, kinetics, and enzymatic reactions, and will be validated against controlled microfluidic experiments and environmental data.\n\nThe study will elucidate how biochemical reactions, physical processes, and diagenesis influence isotope fractionations in compounds such as pyrite and carbonate-associated sulfate. The project will explore the controls on multi-isotope fractionation in metabolic S cycling and investigate how these processes manifest heterogeneously in both aqueous and solid compounds. The insights gained will be applicable at both microscopic and global scales, with potential applications in both modern and ancient settings. Importantly, the project will facilitate the robust interpretation of S and O isotope signals, which in turn can be used to probe S cycling, microenvironmental conditions, and depositional parameters.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will not only advance our understanding of sulfur cycling in ecosystems but will also pave the way for similar treatment of isotopic composition in other natural materials. This comprehensive approach promises to significantly augment the scientific community's ability to interpret isotopic signatures, thereby offering a valuable tool for reconstructing past environmental conditions and informing predictions about ecological and biogeochemical processes.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, titled \"Isotopic Signatures of Sulfur Cycling Organism Physiology and Ecology,\" aims to advance our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur (S) through the development of metabolic-isotopic models (MIMs) that interpret isotopic signals in sedimentary compounds. The study focuses on the isotope fractionations of sulfur and oxygen (O) as influenced by biochemical reactions, physical processes, and diagenesis. The compounds of interest are pyrite and carbonate-associated sulfate, which are central to understanding the sulfur cycle in both modern and ancient settings.\n\nThe goals of the research include elucidating metabolic isotope fractionation during sulfate reduction, reduced sulfur oxidation, and sulfur disproportionation, and investigating the impact of diagenesis on isotope signal preservation. Recognizing the current limitations of simplified isotopic fractionation models and the challenge of capturing heterogeneous diagenesis, the project proposes a novel approach that integrates thermodynamics, kinetics, and enzymatic reactions. Experimental validation will be pursued through microfluidic experiments and comparison with environmental data.\n\nThe proposed MIMs will be embedded in ecosystem models to provide a more robust interpretation of S and O isotope signals. This will allow for an understanding of the controls on multi-isotope fractionation in metabolic sulfur cycling and the heterogeneous manifestation of isotopic compositions in aqueous and solid compounds. Insights gained from this research will have broad applications, including the interpretation of microenvironmental conditions and depositional parameters, and could be extended to similar treatments of isotopic composition in other natural materials.\n\nBy enhancing our mechanistic comprehension of sulfur cycling and its isotopic signatures, this project will contribute significantly to the fields of geochemistry, paleoclimatology, and environmental science. The outcomes will bridge the gap in knowledge between microscale processes and global sulfur cycle dynamics, facilitating a more nuanced interpretation of the Earth's biogeochemical history.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Isotopic Signatures of Sulfur Cycling Organism Physiology and Ecology,\" seeks to fundamentally advance our understanding of sulfur (S) and oxygen (O) isotope fractionations associated with sulfur metabolism and their preservation in geological records through diagenesis. At the heart of this proposal is the development and application of metabolic-isotopic models (MIMs) that are experimentally validated and capable of interpreting the complex isotopic signals found in sedimentary compounds such as pyrite and carbonate-associated sulfate.\n\nCurrent limitations in the field include overly simplified models of isotopic fractionation in dissimilatory sulfur metabolism and challenges in accounting for the heterogeneous nature of diagenesis. Our approach is to construct a hierarchy of MIMs that increase in dimensionality and sophistication, capturing the nuances of biochemical reactions, physical processes, and enzymatic reactions that influence isotope fractionation.\n\nThe project will focus on key sulfur metabolisms, including sulfate reduction, reduced sulfur oxidation, and sulfur disproportionation. By embedding these MIMs into ecosystem models and validating them against microfluidic experiment results and environmental data, we aim to uncover the controls on multi-isotope fractionation and their heterogeneous manifestation in both aqueous and solid compounds. This will enable robust interpretation of isotopic compositions and provide insights into microenvironmental conditions and depositional parameters across microscopic to global scales, in both modern and ancient settings.\n\nThe broader implications of this work include the potential for similar treatment of isotopic composition in other natural materials, thereby opening new avenues for probing biogeochemical cycles. Ultimately, the project promises to deliver a transformative framework for interpreting sulfur cycling in Earth's history, with applications that extend beyond the realm of sulfur to advance our understanding of the Earth system as a whole."

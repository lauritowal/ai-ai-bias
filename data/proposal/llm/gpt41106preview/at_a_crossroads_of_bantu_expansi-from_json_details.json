        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal titled \"At a Crossroads of Bantu Expansions: Present and Past Riverside Communities in the Congo Basin, from an Integrated Linguistic, Anthropological and Archaeological Perspective\" aims to unravel the complexities of the Bantu expansion within the eastern part of the Congo Basin. Specifically, it concentrates on the riverside communities in localities such as Kisangani, Bumba, and Kindu, which are situated in a rich environmental setting characterized by the Central-African rainforest and prominent rivers.\n\nThe project is interdisciplinary in nature, incorporating methodologies from linguistics, anthropology, and archaeology to explore the role of rivers in the settlement and development of speech communities. Linguistic research will include historical comparative linguistics, language classification, and the study of language contact, with a focus on specialized vocabulary related to riverine environments. Anthropological methods will involve ethnoecology, analysis of trade and exchange networks, sociocultural aspects, and ethnohistory, to understand the complex ethnic identities and subsistence strategies, such as farming and fishing, of the communities. Archaeological surveys will aim to develop a chrono-cultural framework that contextualizes the findings within a broader historical perspective.\n\nThe research objectives include investigating the role of rivers in the settlement of the region, the challenges of farming in the rainforest, the historical relations between different speech communities, and the specific river-related vocabulary. Extensive fieldwork will provide insight into the ethnoecology, trade networks, sociocultural life, and ethnohistory of the riverside communities.\n\nThis study promises to offer a comprehensive understanding of how environmental resources, such as rivers, have shaped the linguistic, cultural, and subsistence patterns of the Bantu-speaking populations and their neighbors in the Congo Basin. It will contribute significantly to the fields of Bantu studies and human-environment interactions in rainforest ecosystems."

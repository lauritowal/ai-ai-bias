        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Accelerating biofilm Matrix dispersion with Deep Eutectic Solvents,\" aims to develop an innovative NADES-based biofouling control product for the water treatment sector, particularly in membrane filtration technology. Biofouling—a major challenge in water-recycling and desalination processes—poses a significant threat to the efficiency and longevity of water treatment systems, especially in water-stressed regions. The project addresses the demand for clean water by introducing a solution that not only exceeds the performance of current chemical treatments but also aligns with the market trend towards green and sustainable chemicals.\n\nThe core innovation lies in the application of natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES), which are non-toxic, biodegradable, and can be tuned to specific applications. Preliminary data from the PI’s ERC grant ABSOLUTE indicate that NADES can mitigate biofouling more effectively than competing products, with reduced toxicity and higher biodegradability. These characteristics present a substantial commercial opportunity.\n\nProject deliverables include the composition of the NADES-based biofouling control product, patent filing for intellectual property protection, a scalable commercialisation strategy, economic analysis confirming cost benefits, and demonstration data to solicit feedback from end-users, partners, and potential investors.\n\nThe objective is rapid commercialisation through a university spin-out company, leveraging the clear market pull for sustainable solutions in water treatment. By offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical treatments, the project is poised to make a significant impact on global water management practices.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Accelerating biofilm Matrix dispersion with Deep Eutectic Solvents,\" aims to tackle the significant challenge of biofouling in membrane filtration technology, which is critical for water recycling and desalination processes in water-stressed regions. The innovative approach centers on the development of a NADES-based biofouling control product that leverages natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) recognized for their non-toxic, tunable properties, and high biodegradability. By addressing the market demand for green and sustainable chemicals in the water treatment sector, this project seeks to provide an environmentally friendly solution that outperforms existing chemical treatments in effectiveness while minimizing ecological impact.\n\nPreliminary data derived from the PI's ERC grant ABSOLUTE suggests that the NADES-based product not only exceeds the performance of the nearest competing products in terms of effectiveness but also offers reduced toxicity—a key performance indicator. The project's deliverables include the composition of the biofouling control product, patent filing, a scalable commercialization strategy, economic analysis confirming cost benefits across key industrial sectors, and demonstration data to garner feedback from end-users, partners, and potential investors.\n\nThe ultimate goal is rapid commercialization through the formation of a university spin-out company, capitalizing on the growing market trend towards sustainable chemical solutions. This project promises to deliver a breakthrough in water treatment technology with significant commercial and environmental benefits.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Accelerating Biofilm Matrix Dispersion with Deep Eutectic Solvents\n\nThe proposed project, \"Accelerating Biofilm Matrix Dispersion with Deep Eutectic Solvents,\" addresses the critical challenge of biofouling in membrane filtration processes, essential for water-recycling and desalination in water-stressed regions. Biofouling, the undesirable accumulation of microorganisms on membrane surfaces, leads to reduced efficiency and increased costs in water treatment. Current chemical treatments pose environmental concerns due to their toxicity and low biodegradability.\n\nOur innovative solution employs natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) to mitigate biofouling, capitalizing on the market trend towards green and sustainable chemicals. NADES are non-toxic, biodegradable, and their properties can be tuned to specific applications, offering a superior alternative to existing biofouling control products.\n\nThe project leverages preliminary data from the PI’s ERC grant ABSOLUTE, which indicates that the NADES-based biofouling control product not only exceeds the performance of competing products but also achieves reduced toxicity and higher biodegradability. The deliverables include the development of the NADES-based composition, patent filing, a scalable commercialization strategy, economic analysis confirming cost benefits, and demonstration data for market feedback.\n\nThe objective is rapid commercialization through a university spin-out company, meeting the demand for clean water and contributing to the sustainable management of water resources. The project has the potential to transform water treatment practices, offering a greener and more effective approach to biofouling control.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal entitled \"Accelerating biofilm Matrix dispersion with Deep Eutectic Solvents\" targets the pressing need for sustainable water treatment solutions in water-stressed regions. Focused on mitigating biofouling in membrane filtration processes, this innovative project proposes the development of a novel NADES-based biofouling control product. The proposed solution leverages natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) to address the challenge of biofouling in water-recycling and water-desalination systems, which is currently managed by less environmentally friendly chemical treatments.\n\nThe demand for clean water and the market trend toward green and sustainable chemicals underscore the commercial opportunity for this product, which promises to outperform existing competitors in effectiveness, toxicity, and biodegradability. Backed by preliminary data from the PI’s ERC grant ABSOLUTE, the project's objectives include the creation of a superior biofouling control composition, patent filing, development of a scalable commercialisation strategy, economic analysis demonstrating cost benefits, and gathering market feedback through demonstrations.\n\nThe deliverables are designed to confirm the product's performance indicators, which include reduced toxicity and higher biodegradability, making it an attractive option for industries seeking sustainable water treatment options. The project aims for rapid commercialisation through a university spin-out company, addressing both market pull for green chemicals and the urgent demand for cleaner water. The multidisciplinary approach promises a significant step forward in the water treatment sector, benefiting both the environment and industry stakeholders."

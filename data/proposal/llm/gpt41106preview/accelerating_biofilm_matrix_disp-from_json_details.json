        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal entitled \"Accelerating biofilm Matrix dispersion with Deep Eutectic Solvents\" targets the pressing need for sustainable water treatment solutions in water-stressed regions. Focused on mitigating biofouling in membrane filtration processes, this innovative project proposes the development of a novel NADES-based biofouling control product. The proposed solution leverages natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) to address the challenge of biofouling in water-recycling and water-desalination systems, which is currently managed by less environmentally friendly chemical treatments.\n\nThe demand for clean water and the market trend toward green and sustainable chemicals underscore the commercial opportunity for this product, which promises to outperform existing competitors in effectiveness, toxicity, and biodegradability. Backed by preliminary data from the PI’s ERC grant ABSOLUTE, the project's objectives include the creation of a superior biofouling control composition, patent filing, development of a scalable commercialisation strategy, economic analysis demonstrating cost benefits, and gathering market feedback through demonstrations.\n\nThe deliverables are designed to confirm the product's performance indicators, which include reduced toxicity and higher biodegradability, making it an attractive option for industries seeking sustainable water treatment options. The project aims for rapid commercialisation through a university spin-out company, addressing both market pull for green chemicals and the urgent demand for cleaner water. The multidisciplinary approach promises a significant step forward in the water treatment sector, benefiting both the environment and industry stakeholders."

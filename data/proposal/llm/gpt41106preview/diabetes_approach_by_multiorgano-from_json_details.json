        "Abstract:\n\nThe escalating prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) demands innovative research tools for the development and testing of new therapeutic strategies. Our project, \"Diabetes Approach by Multi-Organ-on-a-Chip,\" is designed to address this pressing need by fabricating a biomimetic multi-organ-on-a-chip integrated device. This device will simulate the complex interactions between skeletal muscle tissues and pancreatic islets to better understand T2D's metabolic dysfunctions, specifically focusing on insulin secretion and action required for glucose homeostasis.\n\nThe application of cutting-edge technologies, including organ-on-a-chip devices, biosensors, miniaturized biosensor systems, and advanced tissue fabrication procedures, will enable the construction of an organically relevant in vitro model. This model will allow for high-content screening applications, facilitating the discovery of new molecular drugs and providing a platform for effective drug testing.\n\nKey functions of the device will include the ability to detect glucose consumption, monitor contraction-induced glucose metabolism, measure insulin secretion, and assess protein biomarker secretion. These functionalities will collectively create a powerful tool for T2D disease modeling and drug discovery.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include the improvement of drug test approaches, the development of new therapies to prevent loss of beta cell mass associated with T2D, and addressing defects in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. The successful implementation of this multi-organ-on-a-chip device has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry by providing a novel therapeutic tool for high-precision drug efficacy and safety assessments.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Diabetes Approach by Multi-Organ-on-a-Chip\" project seeks to revolutionize the study and treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) through the development of an innovative biomimetic multi-organ-on-a-chip device. This integrated system will mimic human metabolic processes, focusing on the critical aspects of insulin secretion, insulin action, and glucose homeostasis that are central to the understanding and management of T2D. Utilizing advanced organ-on-a-chip devices, miniaturized biosensor systems, and state-of-the-art tissue fabrication procedures, the project aims to create a multi-tissue chip that offers a high degree of control over experimental variables and enables high-content screening applications.\n\nThe device will feature engineered components such as skeletal muscle tissues and pancreatic islets, enabling the detection of glucose consumption, monitoring of contraction-induced glucose metabolism, measurement of insulin secretion, and assessment of protein biomarker secretion. These functionalities are poised to not only facilitate in-depth studies of metabolism glucose diseases but also provide a robust platform for drug discovery and screening, allowing for the rapid testing of potential new treatments for T2D.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of the project include the improvement of drug test approaches, the identification of new therapies to prevent the loss of beta-cell mass associated with T2D, and the addressing of defects in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Ultimately, the project aims to design a novel therapeutic tool that has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry by providing more physiologically relevant data and accelerating the development of effective treatments for T2D patients."

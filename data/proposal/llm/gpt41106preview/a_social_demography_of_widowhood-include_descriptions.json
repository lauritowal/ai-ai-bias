        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to advance the understanding of widowhood and its implications within ageing societies by establishing a comprehensive social demography of this critical life event. Widowhood is not only a moment of profound grief but also a condition that heightens the risk of negative mental health and economic outcomes, especially as societal trends show an increase in its occurrence alongside a decrease in survival benefits. Existing research on widowhood has been limited in scope, focusing primarily on immediate wellbeing changes after unexpected bereavement. This project proposes a pioneering approach that considers both the risk of entering widowhood and the vulnerability associated with its aftermath, including the often-overlooked period of terminal health decline preceding death.\n\nThe research will illuminate the impact of widowhood through four innovative dimensions: (1) a conceptual and methodological framework for assessing widowhood risk and vulnerability; (2) an analysis of social inequalities influenced by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age; (3) an examination of how country-specific factors contribute to variations in widowhood experiences; and (4) an investigation of temporal changes in widowhood dynamics from 1985 to 2050.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will harmonize and analyze high-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data from up to 60 ageing countries with diverse demographic trends and welfare systems. Through advanced statistical methods, this research will provide comprehensive and systematic estimates of the risk and vulnerability associated with widowhood. The findings will offer valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders, highlighting the pressing need for tailored interventions and sustainable support mechanisms for the widowed population and their families, as well as informing future research on pension and elder care systems."

Although the frequency of this high risk event is increasing across ageing societies, many countries have cut survival benefits exposing more bereaved spouses to dire short- and long-term consequences. Despite its growing relevance, widowhood research remains underdeveloped compared to other disruptive events, such as divorce. This ground-breaking research moves beyond the state-of-the-art in at least four ways to establish a social demography of widowhood. (1) The foundation of my project lies in an innovative conceptual and methodological approach to the risk and vulnerability to widowhood. While risk aims at the probability and duration of widowhood, vulnerability focuses on its mental health and economic consequences. Current assessments of widowhood effects are limited to change in wellbeing directly after bereavement with a special focus on unexpected deaths. However, the most prevalent scenario entails a process of terminal health decline in the years before death. The consequences of the often neglected longer process of expected widowhood may be larger than the shorter process of unexpected widowhood. Three ground-breaking pillars build on risk and vulnerability to examine (2) social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity and nativity, social support networks, gender and age, as well as (3) country differences and (4) change over time. High-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources will be harmonized and applied to an advanced set of statistical methods for up to 60 ageing countries varying in demographic trends and welfare systems from 1985 with projections to 2050. A social demography of widowhood will supplement fragmented evidence with systematic and comprehensive estimates on risk and vulnerability, provide insights into the challenges facing a growing widowed population and their family members, and facilitate new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems.",

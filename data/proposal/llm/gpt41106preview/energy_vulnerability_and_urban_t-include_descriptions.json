        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for EvalUaTE, a pioneering research project aimed at comprehensively understanding the multidimensional aspects of energy poverty in urban areas of Eastern and Central Europe (ECE). In the post-socialist states of ECE, millions of households face the challenge of heating their homes during winter. This difficulty is exacerbated by a complex interplay of factors, including significant energy price hikes, harsh climatic conditions, prevalent inefficient housing, deteriorating infrastructure, and socio-economic transformations marked by substantial income disparities. The prevailing research and policy approaches have largely been constrained to simplistic correlations between household incomes and energy efficiency. EvalUaTE intends to revolutionize this perspective by employing an energy vulnerability framework, which assesses the tendency of households to suffer from inadequate access to essential home energy services.\n\nThe project will delve into how institutional frameworks, physical urban environments, and daily living patterns contribute to the energy vulnerability experienced by urban residents. A combination of qualitative and quantitative research methodologies will be leveraged to conduct a comparative analysis across eight urban districts within four cities: Gdańsk, Prague, Budapest, and Skopje. This innovative study promises to yield a nuanced understanding of domestic energy deprivation in the context of post-socialist urban settings.\n\nThe findings from EvalUaTE have the potential to inform and enhance current technical and policy mechanisms or to facilitate the development of new approaches to ensure the provision of affordable, clean, and efficient energy services. Furthermore, insights from this research could contribute to broader climate change mitigation efforts by addressing energy inefficiencies at the household level in transitioning urban contexts. The project's outcomes aim to have a meaningful impact on improving the quality of life for millions facing energy poverty in ECE."

The limited body of scholarship and policy tends to conceptualize domestic energy deprivation in ECE through the narrow lens of incomes and energy efficiency. The purpose of this project is to radically transform the state of the art in the field by undertaking the first comprehensive investigation of the multiple social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in the grain of the post-socialist city. The project will use an energy vulnerability framework to explore the causes, character and consequences of domestic energy deprivation in ECE. Energy vulnerability can be seen as the propensity of a household to experience a lack of socially- and materially-necessitated energy services in the home. EvalUaTE will investigate the manner in which institutional structures, built tissues and everyday practices shape urban energy vulnerability. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, the project will achieve its aims by undertaking a comparative study of eight urban districts within Gdańsk (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary) and Skopje (FYR Macedonia). The knowledge gained from the project can potentially lead to the improvement of existing, or establishment of new, technical and institutional frameworks for the provision of affordable, clean and efficient energy services in transitioning urban areas, ultimately aiding climate change mitigation.",

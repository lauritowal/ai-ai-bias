        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The neural basis of dynamic territorial aggression and fear,\" aims to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying territorial behaviors, focusing on the medial hypothalamic brain structure's role as a switch between social aggression and avoidance. The research will involve the study of mice in a semi-natural laboratory environment to simulate realistic territorial scenarios. Objectives include mapping where and how territory is encoded within the brain, understanding the control of the hypothalamic switch by such encoding, and monitoring how mice dynamically acquire territories over time. The project will employ cutting-edge techniques, such as in vivo neural recording to track brain activity, activity perturbation to manipulate neural circuits, and computational modeling to decipher synaptic integration and plasticity.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include a detailed understanding of the synaptic mechanisms that underpin territory-based decision-making and insights into potential interventions for maladaptive responses to threats. By investigating medial hypothalamic structure's activity, this study will also test the hypothesis that it encodes a map of social space and requires social experience for its formation. The implications of this research extend to a broader biological comprehension of human aggression and fear and offer prospects for addressing maladaptive responses to threats to personal space, resources, and beliefsâ€”conditions heightened by factors such as seasonal changes and increased population density.\n\nThis proposal is poised to make significant contributions to the field of neuroscience by illuminating the neural circuits and processes that govern territorial aggression and social avoidance, thereby advancing our understanding of fundamental behaviors that shape the interactions of humans and other animals."

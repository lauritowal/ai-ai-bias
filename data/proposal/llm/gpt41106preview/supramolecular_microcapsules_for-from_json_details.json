        "Abstract:\n\nThe SUPROTECT project proposes a transformative approach to enhance the scalability of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) cultivation through the development of innovatively designed supramolecular microcapsules. Building on our substantial groundwork in bioactive hydrogel synthesis and static 3D iPSC culture, the primary objective is to synthesize squaramide-based (SQ) materials tailored for iPSC bioreactor expansion. This proof-of-concept study aims to prepare microcapsules with SQ material either at the core or shell, optimizing protocols for encapsulating iPSCs. The feasibility of these microcapsules will be rigorously tested in dynamic bioreactor conditions to assess iPSC proliferation and quality post-release. Concurrently, the project will undertake detailed market research, strengthen intellectual property positions, and aim for product licensing consolidation. SUPROTECT endeavors to revolutionize iPSC culture systems, offering a scalable, efficient solution to meet the growing demand for stem cell therapies, with implications for personalized medicine and regenerative healthcare solutions."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Communication in Action: Towards a model of Contextualized Action and Language Processing\" project proposes the development of the Contextualized Action and Language (CoALa) processing model, which will offer a revolutionary perspective on in situ language processing. This project is motivated by the premise that language is fundamentally multimodal and that its primary function is to coordinate social actions within conversational structures characterized by rapid turn-taking.\n\nGrounded in the hypothesis that co-speech bodily signals are pivotal for managing the psycholinguistic challenges posed by the millisecond gaps between speaking turns, this project will examine how these signals facilitate the comprehension and planning of social actions such as questions, offers, and declines. To achieve this, the project will undertake three subprojects: ProdAct will investigate the multimodal architecture of social actions using conversational corpora, testing the assumption that social actions are accompanied by distinct \"visual signatures.\" CompAct will explore whether these bodily signals contribute early and rapidly to comprehension during social interactions. Finally, IntAct will study the role bodily signals play in the comprehension process while individuals plan their next social action.\n\nBy integrating insights from psychology, philosophy, and sociology, the CoALa model aims to address key challenges in language processing, such as multimodal integration and the execution of social actions within the constraints of conversational dynamics. The project's interdisciplinary approach promises to advance our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying human communication and to enhance psycholinguistic theory by substantiating the significance of bodily signals in linguistic exchanges.\n\nThe successful development of the CoALa processing model will have profound implications for our perception of language as an embodied, socially embedded phenomenon, and it will pave the way for new research avenues in the cognitive sciences and beyond."

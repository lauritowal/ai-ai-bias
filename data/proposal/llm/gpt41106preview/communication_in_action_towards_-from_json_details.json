        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"Communication in Action: Towards a model of Contextualized Action and Language Processing\", an interdisciplinary research initiative aimed at developing the Contextualized Action and Language (CoALa) processing model. This innovative model focuses on in situ language processing, emphasizing the multimodal nature of language and its integral role in performing social actions within the millisecond constraints of conversational turn-taking.\n\nThe project is inspired by the hypothesis that co-speech bodily signals are pivotal in managing the psycholinguistic challenges posed by the rapid succession of speaking turns. By facilitating language processing, these signals enable the seamless integration of comprehension and planning needed for social interaction. The CoALa model will provide a comprehensive framework that reconciles the intersection of multimodal cues and social action dynamics within conversational structures.\n\nTo substantiate the CoALa model, the project comprises three subprojects: ProdAct, CompAct, and IntAct. ProdAct will investigate the multimodal architecture of social actions, such as questions, offers, and declines, using conversational corpora, examining the assumption that social actions exhibit distinct 'visual signatures'. CompAct will test the contribution of these bodily signatures to the early and rapid comprehension of social actions. Finally, IntAct will explore how these signals inform comprehension while individuals plan their subsequent social action, addressing the intricate coordination of multimodal integration.\n\nThis project is poised to make significant contributions to the fields of psychology, philosophy, and sociology by offering a nuanced understanding of language processing as a multimodal, socially embedded phenomenon. By tackling challenges such as multimodal integration, rapid turn-taking, and the intersection of comprehension and planning, the CoALa model aims to revolutionize our understanding of communication and set the stage for future research in psycholinguistics and beyond.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Communication in Action: Towards a model of Contextualized Action and Language Processing\n\nThe proposed project, Communication in Action, aims to develop the Contextualized Action and Language (CoALa) processing model. This innovative research endeavor focuses on in situ language processing and emphasizes the multimodal and social nature of language. Language is not merely a means of conveying information; it is a tool used to perform social actions within the framework of conversational structure characterized by rapid turn-taking and millisecond gaps between speaking turns.\n\nThe CoALa model hypothesizes that co-speech bodily signals play a crucial role in navigating the psycholinguistic challenges posed by the speed and structure of conversation. These signals are posited to aid in dealing with the conversational challenges by facilitating language processing, particularly in the rapid comprehension and response phases inherent in social interactions.\n\nThe project features three subprojects, each designed to address specific facets of the model. ProdAct will investigate the multimodal architecture of social actions by analyzing conversational corpora for distinct 'visual signatures'. CompAct aims to test the contribution of these bodily signatures to the comprehension of social actions, querying whether they play an early and rapid role. IntAct will explore how bodily signals influence comprehension while individuals plan their next social action.\n\nWith an interdisciplinary approach encompassing psychology, philosophy, and sociology, Communication in Action seeks to integrate diverse perspectives to address key challenges in the field. These include multimodal integration in language processing, the rapid nature of conversational turn-taking, and the interplay between comprehension and planning in social action.\n\nThrough this work, the CoALa model aspires to provide a comprehensive understanding of how language and action are contextualized and processed in real-time social interactions, significantly advancing psycholinguistic theory and our understanding of human communication.\n\nKeywords: in situ language processing, multimodal communication, social action, psycholinguistics, conversational structure, CoALa model.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Communication in Action: Towards a Model of Contextualized Action and Language Processing\n\nThe proposed project, \"Communication in Action: Towards a Model of Contextualized Action and Language Processing\" (CoAct), seeks to develop a groundbreaking Contextualized Action and Language (CoALa) processing model. This model will be the first of its kind to specifically address the multimodal and social aspects of in situ language processing. CoALa will integrate insights from psychology, philosophy, and sociology to better understand how humans use language as a tool for social action within the rapid-fire context of conversational exchange.\n\nConversational structure, characterized by millisecond gaps between speaking turns, presents a significant psycholinguistic challenge that the CoALa model aims to elucidate. The underlying hypothesis is that co-speech bodily signals—such as gestures and facial expressions—play a critical role in bridging these gaps, aiding comprehension, and facilitating the planning of subsequent social actions.\n\nThe project is organized into three synergistic subprojects: ProdAct, CompAct, and IntAct. ProdAct will investigate the multimodal architecture of social actions, such as questions, offers, and declines, using conversational corpora to identify distinct 'visual signatures.' CompAct will test the hypothesis that these bodily signatures contribute early and rapidly to the comprehension of social actions. Finally, IntAct will explore the role of bodily signals in the comprehension of social actions while individuals plan their next move in the conversational dance.\n\nBy addressing challenges such as the integration of multimodal cues in language processing and the rapid nature of conversational turn-taking, CoAct will not only advance psycholinguistic theory but also have practical implications for improving communication in various social contexts. The CoALa model promises to provide a comprehensive framework to understand the complex dynamism of real-world language use, with the potential to impact educational, technological, and clinical fields.\n\nKeywords: language processing, multimodal communication, psycholinguistics, social action, conversational structure, CoALa model.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Communication in Action: Towards a model of Contextualized Action and Language Processing\" project proposes the development of the Contextualized Action and Language (CoALa) processing model, which will offer a revolutionary perspective on in situ language processing. This project is motivated by the premise that language is fundamentally multimodal and that its primary function is to coordinate social actions within conversational structures characterized by rapid turn-taking.\n\nGrounded in the hypothesis that co-speech bodily signals are pivotal for managing the psycholinguistic challenges posed by the millisecond gaps between speaking turns, this project will examine how these signals facilitate the comprehension and planning of social actions such as questions, offers, and declines. To achieve this, the project will undertake three subprojects: ProdAct will investigate the multimodal architecture of social actions using conversational corpora, testing the assumption that social actions are accompanied by distinct \"visual signatures.\" CompAct will explore whether these bodily signals contribute early and rapidly to comprehension during social interactions. Finally, IntAct will study the role bodily signals play in the comprehension process while individuals plan their next social action.\n\nBy integrating insights from psychology, philosophy, and sociology, the CoALa model aims to address key challenges in language processing, such as multimodal integration and the execution of social actions within the constraints of conversational dynamics. The project's interdisciplinary approach promises to advance our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying human communication and to enhance psycholinguistic theory by substantiating the significance of bodily signals in linguistic exchanges.\n\nThe successful development of the CoALa processing model will have profound implications for our perception of language as an embodied, socially embedded phenomenon, and it will pave the way for new research avenues in the cognitive sciences and beyond."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Non-Ergodic Quantum Matter: Universality, Dynamics and Control\n\nThe proposed project aims to pioneer the theoretical framework for non-ergodic quantum matterâ€”systems that defy the conventional march towards thermal equilibrium. Harnessing recent experimental breakthroughs in quantum simulators that realize such non-ergodic states, our research will delve into established non-ergodic phases such as many-body localized states, glassy and kinetically constrained models, and systems exhibiting weak ergodicity breaking. \n\nThe central objective of this project is to build a comprehensive theory that elucidates the universal properties and dynamics of non-ergodic quantum systems. This includes a detailed study of the nature of their long-time dynamics and steady states, as well as the conditions under which these systems avoid thermalization. By doing so, we aim to reveal the fundamental principles governing these exotic phases of matter and contribute to a broader understanding of quantum thermalization processes.\n\nOur methodology will involve describing the universal properties of highly-excited eigenstates, their entanglement characteristics, and developing novel simulation methods for non-ergodic dynamics. We will also focus on identifying experimental signatures that can guide the search for non-ergodic phases in laboratory settings. The project promises practical applications in the realms of quantum information storage and processing, utilizing the extended quantum coherence times of non-ergodic systems for many-body state preparation and optimal control.\n\nLed by the Principal Investigator's expertise in many-body localization, this research is poised to offer profound insights into the quantum-mechanical underpinnings of thermalization, lay the groundwork for a general theory of non-equilibrium quantum systems, and potentially revolutionize the field of quantum information science. Our outcomes will not only advance theoretical understanding but also influence experimental pursuits, offering a strategic direction for the discovery and application of non-ergodic phases.\n\nKeywords: non-ergodic quantum matter, thermal equilibrium, many-body localization, quantum information, theoretical physics, quantum simulators."

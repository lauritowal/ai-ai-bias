        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Major depression as a metabolic disorder: The role of oxygen homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics in depression etiology and therapy\n\nThe project \"MitO2Health\" aims to redefine Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a systemic energy deficiency disease, shifting the paradigm from the traditional neurotransmitter deficiency concept to a model centered on cellular metabolism. This novel approach hypothesizes that the etiology of MDD involves reduced mitochondrial ATP production and disturbances in oxygen homeostasis, contributing to oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\nThe research will be conducted through a longitudinal study involving 300 participants, divided into three groups: 100 MDD patients receiving Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 100 MDD patients on a waiting list, and 100 healthy controls. Over 18 months, the study will assess the clinical and biological status of participants at four intervals: baseline, post-treatment, and at 6- and 18-month follow-ups. The comparative analysis will focus on mitochondrial bioenergy production and oxygen homeostasis, aiming to uncover physiological mechanisms underlying MDD, establish biomarker profiles for treatment response and resistance, and characterize symptom recurrence.\n\nThe findings from MitO2Health are anticipated to revolutionize the understanding of MDD by establishing a modern etiological model based on metabolic dysfunction. By identifying individual biomarkers of therapy response and potential relapse, the project sets the stage for personalized treatment concepts, improving clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and psychiatry. Ultimately, this research holds the promise of providing a scientific foundation for targeted interventions that address the metabolic roots of MDD, offering new hope for millions affected by this debilitating disorder."

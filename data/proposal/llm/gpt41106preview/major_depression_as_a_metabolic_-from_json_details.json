        "Abstract\n\nThe MitO2Health project aims to revolutionize our understanding of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), proposing a shift from the traditional neurotransmitter deficiency concept to a model that frames MDD as a systemic energy deficiency disease rooted in mitochondrial bioenergetics and oxygen homeostasis impairments. The project hypothesizes that MDD is a cellular-metabolic disorder characterized by reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, lowered oxygen transport and utilization, and exacerbated by oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\nTo substantiate this novel approach, MitO2Health will conduct an 18-month longitudinal study involving 300 participants across three groups: MDD patients receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), MDD patients on a waiting list, and healthy controls. Each group will consist of 100 individuals. The study design incorporates four assessment points—initial, post-treatment, 6-month follow-up, and 18-month follow-up—to capture the dynamic interplay between mitochondrial health parameters and MDD progression.\n\nThe primary research goals are to investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying MDD, provide longitudinal evidence of the relationship between mitochondrial and oxygen homeostasis factors and MDD, and test the hypothesis that MDD symptom reduction is linked to the normalization of these parameters through CBT intervention. Outcomes will include detailed biomarker profiles indicative of MDD treatment response, resistance, and symptom recurrence characterization.\n\nThe impact of MitO2Health extends beyond academic contributions, aiming to establish a modern etiological model of MDD, identify individual biomarkers predictive of therapy response and relapse risk, inspire the development of personalized MDD treatment concepts, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and psychiatric practices. The project promises to redefine the clinical approach to MDD, fostering a paradigm shift towards treating depression as a systemic, bioenergetic disorder.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"MitO2Health,\" endeavors to reconceptualize Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a systemic energy deficiency disease, going beyond the traditional neurotransmitter deficiency model. This innovative hypothesis posits that MDD is a cellular-metabolic disorder characterized by reduced mitochondrial energy production and impaired oxygen homeostasis. The aim is to develop and empirically validate a new etiological model of MDD that integrates mitochondrial bioenergetics and oxygen regulation.\n\nThe \"MitO2Health\" project will employ a longitudinal study design, involving 300 participants across three groups: 100 MDD patients receiving Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 100 MDD patients on a waiting list, and 100 healthy controls. Over 18 months, participants will undergo four assessment points to monitor clinical and biological status, including initial, post-treatment, 6-month, and 18-month follow-ups. The intervention group will undergo a 6-month CBT treatment, examining its effects on MitO2Health parameters and MDD symptoms.\n\nThe study seeks to illuminate physiological mechanisms underlying MDD, provide longitudinal evidence of the interplay between MitO2Health parameters and MDD, and test the hypothesis that symptom reduction is coupled with the normalization of MitO2Health parameters. Expected outcomes include identifying biomarker profiles related to MDD treatment response and resistance, as well as characterizing symptom recurrence.\n\nThe anticipated impact of \"MitO2Health\" is manifold: establishing a modern etiological model of MDD, identifying biomarkers for individual therapy response and relapse, and inspiring personalized MDD treatment concepts. Ultimately, this could significantly improve clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and psychiatry by shifting the paradigm from a purely neuropsychiatric disorder to a treatable systemic energy deficiency condition. This groundbreaking research promises to deepen our understanding of MDD and revolutionize its treatment, offering hope for millions suffering from this debilitating disorder.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Major depression as a metabolic disorder: The role of oxygen homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics in depression etiology and therapy\n\nThe MitO2Health project proposes a paradigm shift in the understanding of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) by developing and empirically validating a novel model that conceptualizes MDD as a systemic energy deficiency disease. This groundbreaking research challenges the traditional neurotransmitter deficiency framework, introducing the hypothesis that MDD is a cellular-metabolic disorder, primarily characterized by reduced mitochondrial energy production and compromised oxygen homeostasis.\n\nThis longitudinal study aims to rigorously investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying MDD, examining the interplay between mitochondrial bioenergetics and mental health. A total of 300 participants will be enrolled, including 100 MDD patients undergoing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), 100 MDD patients on a waiting list, and 100 healthy controls. Over the course of 18 months, the study will conduct four assessment points to capture the clinical and biological status of participants, focusing on biomarker profiles for MDD treatment response, resistance, and symptom recurrence.\n\nThe innovative study design incorporates a randomized treatment condition using CBT over six months, allowing for a comparative analysis of the effects on MDD patients relative to controls. Outcomes will include the identification of physiological biomarkers that inform on treatment efficacy and provide insight into the etiology of MDD.\n\nThe potential impacts of MitO2Health are substantial, promising to establish a modern etiological model of MDD, identify biomarkers of individual therapy response and relapse, inspire personalized MDD treatment concepts, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and psychiatry. By addressing the impairments in mitochondrial bioenergy production and oxygen homeostasis, MitO2Health is poised to transform our understanding and management of Major Depressive Disorder.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Major depression as a metabolic disorder: The role of oxygen homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics in depression etiology and therapy\n\nThe project \"MitO2Health\" aims to redefine Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as a systemic energy deficiency disease, shifting the paradigm from the traditional neurotransmitter deficiency concept to a model centered on cellular metabolism. This novel approach hypothesizes that the etiology of MDD involves reduced mitochondrial ATP production and disturbances in oxygen homeostasis, contributing to oxidative stress and inflammation.\n\nThe research will be conducted through a longitudinal study involving 300 participants, divided into three groups: 100 MDD patients receiving Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 100 MDD patients on a waiting list, and 100 healthy controls. Over 18 months, the study will assess the clinical and biological status of participants at four intervals: baseline, post-treatment, and at 6- and 18-month follow-ups. The comparative analysis will focus on mitochondrial bioenergy production and oxygen homeostasis, aiming to uncover physiological mechanisms underlying MDD, establish biomarker profiles for treatment response and resistance, and characterize symptom recurrence.\n\nThe findings from MitO2Health are anticipated to revolutionize the understanding of MDD by establishing a modern etiological model based on metabolic dysfunction. By identifying individual biomarkers of therapy response and potential relapse, the project sets the stage for personalized treatment concepts, improving clinical outcomes in psychotherapy and psychiatry. Ultimately, this research holds the promise of providing a scientific foundation for targeted interventions that address the metabolic roots of MDD, offering new hope for millions affected by this debilitating disorder."

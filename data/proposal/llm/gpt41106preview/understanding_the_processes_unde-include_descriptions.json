        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to develop a novel analytical framework that addresses critical challenges in social science research concerning the interrelations of constructs such as beliefs, values, and attitudes. In the quest to understand the drivers behind polarizing issues like climate change, political ideology, and vaccine hesitancy, social scientists have relied on large-scale survey data. However, traditional regression analyses fail to account for the fact that these constructs are latent and measured with error, leading to underestimated effects and misguided conclusions. Furthermore, when studying diverse groups, such as multiple countries, the complexity of varying underlying processes exacerbates the difficulty of identifying consistent or divergent patterns in the relationships between constructs. Additionally, measurement non-invariance, arising from factors like translation discrepancies, threatens the validity of cross-group comparisons by conflating construct differences with measurement artifacts.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, our grant proposal introduces a cutting-edge mixture multigroup structural equation modeling framework that will revolutionize the analysis of complex survey data. This advanced method will correct for measurement error, accommodate the unique processes within different groups, and account for measurement non-invariance. By employing a clustering approach, the framework will identify subsets of groups that share common underlying processes, thereby refining the analysis of construct relations. This structured methodology ensures that observed differences are rooted in actual variations in construct dynamics rather than methodological biases.\n\nThe project's culmination will see the integration of these innovative methods into freely accessible software, democratizing the ability for researchers to apply sophisticated statistical techniques to their work. The anticipated outcome is a significant leap forward in the accuracy and depth of understanding the factors that shape societal beliefs, with profound implications for addressing polarization and enhancing policy interventions."

For example, do values affect climate change beliefs? Do perceived threats predict political beliefs? Do risk perception and susceptibility to misinformation determine vaccine hesitancy? Polarized beliefs about climate, politics, and vaccination are a societal threat and it is important to study what drives them. Large-scale survey data is gathered to do so. Using regression to answer the questions ignores that constructs are not directly observable, but measured by survey items containing measurement error (challenge 1). Not correcting for this causes the studied effects to be underestimated and conclusions to be misguided. When many groups are involved - such as many countries in the European Social Survey - the underlying processes likely differ across groups. For example, drivers of climate change beliefs may differ for countries experiencing extreme weather. Group-specific or multilevel analyses result in numerous group-specific regression slopes or random effects, making it hard to find which regression effects are different or similar for which groups (challenge 2). Across many groups, the constructs' measurement is often inequivalent or 'non-invariant', for example, due to translation (challenge 3). A measurement model indicates how items measure a construct and disregarding non-invariance in this model invalidates the comparison of effects among constructs (i.e., one may find differences that are actually due to non-invariance). By tackling challenges 1-3, the proposed mixture multigroup structural equation modelling framework provides the tools to break new ground in understanding what drives constructs like polarized beliefs. A clustering finds subsets of groups with common processes. Flexible measurement models account for non-invariance so that the clustering focuses on the processes. I will implement the methods in freely available software.",

        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal introduces an ambitious research project designed to provide a comprehensive reevaluation of urban governance in China, an undertaking of immense global importance given the country's rapid urban transformation. The study aims to dissect the intricate layers of urban governance from the microcosm of neighborhood interactions to the macrocosm of regional dynamics, encapsulating the full spectrum of China's urban development.\n\nAt the neighborhood level, the project will delve into the dynamics between the state and societal forces within everyday living spaces, examining the role of migrant social agencies and the self-governance mechanisms within homeowners' associations. Moving to the urban scale, the research will probe into the strategies governing urban development, specifically focusing on the integration of migrants, ecological considerations, and the deployment of financial instruments and land markets in project implementations.\n\nExpanding to the regional perspective, the project seeks to unravel the complex state-market interplay that redistributes populations and economic activities, shaping the emergent city-region geography. The research methodology will be rooted in grounded ethnography, extensive interviews, and collaborations with Chinese scholars and policymakers. Investigations will span six strategically selected cases, including major cities and national strategic projects, reflecting diverse regional contexts.\n\nThe timing of the project is critical, aligning with China's adoption of a new urban agenda endorsed by the United Nations and current global trade tensions. Anticipated outcomes include a transformative understanding of Chinese urban governance and a pioneering consideration of indigenous viewpoints on urban change in China. The research will contribute to theories of entrepreneurial urban governance and involve a series of workshops within China for collaborative knowledge production, culminating in a range of scholarly publications."

This ground-breaking project will rethink China’s model of urban governance through grounded and multi-scalar investigations ranging from neighbourhoods and cities to regions. For neighbourhoods, it unravels the interface between state and society in everyday living space, migrant social agencies and the self-governance of homeowners’ associations under urbanisation and housing marketization. For cities, it interrogates the development strategies and governance of migrant and ecological urbanism as well as the implementation of projects through financial instruments and the land market. For regions, it uncovers entangled state–market relations which redistribute population and economic activities across cities and produce the city-region. The research will be conducted through six cases: Shanghai, Wuhan, Dali, Xiongan, Jing-Jin-Ji (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), and the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area, based upon grounded ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews and close engagement with Chinese researchers and policy makers across different types of neighbourhoods and cities of varying sizes in coastal, central and western regions, and recent national strategic projects. The project is timely for China to implement a UN-endorsed new urban agenda and rethink its model in the face of trade tensions. It will change how we think of China and its governance and be the first of its kind to explicitly consider indigenous perspectives on Chinese urban transformation. This innovative and contextually sensitive research will contribute to entrepreneurial urban governance theories and will offer a theoretically nuanced and grounded explanation of state entrepreneurialism in China, with six workshops organised within China as integral parts of knowledge production as well as a series of publication outputs.",

        "Abstract\n\n**Early warning of future rapid Arctic sea ice loss**\n\nThe Arctic region is undergoing a significant climatic transformation, with projections indicating seasonally ice-free conditions becoming the norm by the 2050s. This project, entitled \"ArcticWATCH\", aims to develop an integrated early warning system, capable of predicting rapid Arctic sea ice loss with annual updates from the following summer up to five years in advance. The system will leverage a suite of data sources, including climate model projections, initialized climate model predictions, machine-learning-based predictions, satellite observations, and climate reconstructions.\n\nOur hypothesis posits that the Arctic sea ice will experience an abrupt decline before the year 2030, following a decade of relative stability. To test this hypothesis and enhance predictability, ArcticWATCH will conduct targeted numerical experiments to identify new pathways of sea ice predictability. These experiments will also provide design guidance for the Arctic observing system over the next 30 years.\n\nThe proposed early warning system will focus on capturing sub-decadal fluctuations and patterns of stability, with an emphasis on the critical period of 3 to 5 years when an abrupt decline is expected. By integrating innovative targeted numerical experiments, ArcticWATCH will reveal the complex environmental impacts of sea ice loss, including Arctic heatwaves, precipitation extremes, and the broader interactions with Arctic and North Atlantic oceanic circulation.\n\nOur project stands to offer transformative insights into the mechanisms of sea ice retreat and the ability to provide actionable alerts to stakeholders. The outcomes from ArcticWATCH will be pivotal in mitigating risks and adapting strategies for Arctic nations, indigenous communities, and global climate policy, as we approach an unprecedented era in Arctic climatology.\n\nKeywords: Arctic sea ice, early warning system, climate model predictions, machine learning, numerical experiments, environmental impacts."

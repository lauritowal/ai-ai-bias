        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Creative Agency and Religious Minorities: ‘hidden galleries’ in the secret police archives in 20th Century Central and Eastern Europe\n\nThis pioneering project seeks to fundamentally reframe our understanding of the creative agency of religious minorities in Central and Eastern Europe during the 20th century, through a comprehensive comparative study of secret police archives. The research will delve into the confiscated religious art and publications of these communities within Romania, Moldova, and Hungary to uncover the broader implications for religious pluralism and intolerance in contemporary society.\n\nThe project's interdisciplinary approach, integrating archival research, anthropological methods, and cultural studies, is designed to shift the perspective from traditional narratives of justice and truth to one of creative agency and cultural patrimony. By examining millions of files containing materials such as confiscated religious art and minority publications, the research will explore the extension of pluralism and the role of minority religious groups in challenging the hegemonic order under political contexts like fascism and communism.\n\nStructured in three stages, the project will first copy, retrieve, and catalogue creative material from the archives. The second stage involves ethnographic research with the communities that produced these materials to understand their experiences and significance. The final stage is the curation and presentation of a touring exhibition, which aims to extend the project's impact by bringing these previously hidden materials to the public eye.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes include a re-examination and re-contextualization of the holdings in secret police archives and an investigation into the confiscated religious art and publications, providing new insights into the struggles and contributions of religious minorities. This project promises to contribute significantly to the fields of history, anthropology of religion, and cultural studies, while also engaging a broad public audience through its exhibition.\n\nKeywords: Creative agency, religious minorities, secret police archives, Central and Eastern Europe, 20th century, cultural patrimony, pluralism, ethnographic research, public exhibition.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Creative Agency and Religious Minorities: ‘hidden galleries’ in the secret police archives in 20th Century Central and Eastern Europe\" embarks on an unprecedented comparative study that brings together the disciplines of history, anthropology of religion, and cultural studies. This research will delve into the secret police archives of Romania, Moldova, and Hungary, focusing on the creative agency and cultural contributions of religious minorities under the oppressive political regimes of the 20th century, marked by fascism and communism.\n\nThe core aim is to re-examine and re-contextualize the archives' holdings, exploring the confiscated religious art and publications, thereby shedding light on the role of religious minorities in challenging the hegemonic order and contributing to cultural pluralism. The project will employ ethnographic research methods with the communities that produced these creative materials, aiming to connect past experiences with contemporary issues of religious pluralism and intolerance.\n\nThe research will proceed through three stages: firstly, copying, retrieving, and cataloging the creative material from the archives; secondly, conducting ethnographic research with the communities that created the material; and finally, curating and staging a touring exhibition that will present these artistic creations to the public. This exhibition aims to extend the impact of the research by engaging a broader audience, thus enhancing the understanding of the historical significance of religious minorities and their resilience through creative expression.\n\nBy investigating millions of files related to confiscated religious art and publications, the project promises to offer a new perspectival shift on the use of secret police archives – from a focus on justice and truth to an appreciation of creative agency and cultural patrimony. Ultimately, the outcome will provide valuable insights into the role of minority religious groups in extending cultural pluralism and challenging historical narratives dominated by political suppression.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Creative Agency and Religious Minorities: ‘hidden galleries’ in the secret police archives in 20th Century Central and Eastern Europe,\" represents the first comparative research endeavor that re-examines the historical and anthropological significance of secret police archives from an innovative angle. This interdisciplinary study, melding archival investigation with anthropological and cultural studies methodologies, concentrates on the creative agency of religious minorities within the political milieu of fascism and communism in Romania, Moldavia, and Hungary during the 20th century.\n\nThe project's primary objective is to reassess and contextualize the holdings of these archives, which contain millions of files, including confiscated religious art and publications of religious minorities. By engaging in ethnographic research with the communities that generated these materials, the project aims to uncover the ways in which minority religious groups have historically contested the prevailing hegemonic order and contributed to the extension of pluralism.\n\nThis research is structured into three stages: (1) Copying, retrieving, and cataloging the creative materials from the archives; (2) Conducting ethnographic research with the communities that produced these materials; and (3) Curating and staging a touring exhibition to publicly showcase the artistic creations. Through this process, the project seeks to shift the perspective from one focused on justice and truth to one that appreciates the dimension of creative agency and cultural patrimony.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is a nuanced understanding of religious pluralism and intolerance in contemporary society. By presenting the findings in a public exhibition, the project not only extends its impact but also promotes awareness of the rich cultural heritage and resiliency of religious minorities. This project, therefore, not only contributes to the academic fields of history, anthropology, and cultural studies but also engages with the wider public in a meaningful dialogue about cultural identity and diversity.\n\n(Word Count: 298)",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Creative Agency and Religious Minorities: ‘hidden galleries’ in the secret police archives in 20th Century Central and Eastern Europe\" represents a groundbreaking comparative study that re-examines the significance of secret police archives from an innovative angle. By focusing on the creative outputs of religious minorities during the tumultuous 20th century, the project seeks to uncover the cultural patrimony and agency within the realms of history and the anthropology of religion, particularly in the context of fascist and communist political regimes in Romania, Moldova, and Hungary.\n\nThis interdisciplinary research will involve archival analysis, anthropological inquiry, and cultural studies, engaging with millions of files that contain confiscated religious art and publications of religious minorities. The project will progress through three major stages: first, the copying, retrieval, and cataloging of creative materials from the archives; second, conducting ethnographic research with the communities that originally produced these materials; and third, curating and staging a touring exhibition to share these hidden treasures with the public.\n\nOur objectives are to examine the role of minority religious groups in challenging the hegemonic order and to explore the extension of pluralism in contemporary society. Through this process, we aim to shift the perspective on the uses of secret police archives from a focus on justice and truth to one that recognizes creative agency and cultural patrimony.\n\nThe outcome of the project promises to be multifaceted, providing insights into religious pluralism, intolerance, and the broader socio-political dynamics of the 20th century. Additionally, the public exhibition will serve as a profound extension of impact, bringing to light the creative expressions of communities that have remained obscured for decades. This project not only contributes to academic discourse but also fosters a deeper understanding of cultural heritage and resilience among the general populace."

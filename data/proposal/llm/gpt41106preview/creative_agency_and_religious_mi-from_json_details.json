        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Creative Agency and Religious Minorities: ‘hidden galleries’ in the secret police archives in 20th Century Central and Eastern Europe\" represents a groundbreaking comparative study that re-examines the significance of secret police archives from an innovative angle. By focusing on the creative outputs of religious minorities during the tumultuous 20th century, the project seeks to uncover the cultural patrimony and agency within the realms of history and the anthropology of religion, particularly in the context of fascist and communist political regimes in Romania, Moldova, and Hungary.\n\nThis interdisciplinary research will involve archival analysis, anthropological inquiry, and cultural studies, engaging with millions of files that contain confiscated religious art and publications of religious minorities. The project will progress through three major stages: first, the copying, retrieval, and cataloging of creative materials from the archives; second, conducting ethnographic research with the communities that originally produced these materials; and third, curating and staging a touring exhibition to share these hidden treasures with the public.\n\nOur objectives are to examine the role of minority religious groups in challenging the hegemonic order and to explore the extension of pluralism in contemporary society. Through this process, we aim to shift the perspective on the uses of secret police archives from a focus on justice and truth to one that recognizes creative agency and cultural patrimony.\n\nThe outcome of the project promises to be multifaceted, providing insights into religious pluralism, intolerance, and the broader socio-political dynamics of the 20th century. Additionally, the public exhibition will serve as a profound extension of impact, bringing to light the creative expressions of communities that have remained obscured for decades. This project not only contributes to academic discourse but also fosters a deeper understanding of cultural heritage and resilience among the general populace."

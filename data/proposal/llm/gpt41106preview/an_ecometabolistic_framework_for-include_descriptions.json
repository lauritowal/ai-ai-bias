        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative interdisciplinary project aimed at revolutionizing sustainable building practices by embracing a bio-based material paradigm, addressing the critical issue of material depletion. With the architectural field slow to adapt to sustainable materials, despite increasing legislation and professional interest, this project confronts the significant challenges posed by the intrinsic characteristics of bio-based materials: their complex variability, unanticipated behaviors, and inherently shorter lifespans. The project contends that the adoption of bio-based materials necessitates a radical re-evaluation of the foundational values of architecture, advocating for a broader understanding of material lifespans and the development of novel construction methodologies. \n\nAt the heart of the proposal is the development of an eco-metabolistic framework that supports carbon-neutral, renewable, and material-efficient design strategies. This approach is operationalized through the research-by-design method, examining three distinct bio-based materials—glulam, bio-polymer composites, and bioluminescent bacteria. The project leverages advanced computational modeling networks to enable predictive modeling, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing of these materials. \n\nA pivotal aspect of the project is its challenge to the conventional notion of design agency, extending it beyond the point of building completion to encourage ongoing participatory practices. By redefining the perceived limitations of bio-based materials' lifespans as beneficial attributes, the project promotes a dynamic model of continual construction. Ultimately, this transformative approach seeks to foster sustainable, socially responsible, and democratic production models, aligning the built environment with the urgent needs of our planet."

Despite well-organised calls for action maturing into legislation and an attentive profession, architecture is proving reticent in this transition. Bio-based materials are fundamentally different to current building materials being characterised by their complex heterogeneity, unpredictable behaviours and limited lifespans. This project identifies that the key impediments to this transition lie with architecture’s inability to represent, conceptualise and operationalise bio-based materials. It argues that to design with bio-based materials we must challenge the fundamental value proposition of architecture and expand our conception of material lifespan to find new practices of construction. It proposes a holistic eco-metabolistic framework, that allows for carbon-neutral, renewable and materially optimised design solutions. It employs a research-by-design method to investigate three bio-based material perspectives (glulam, bio-polymer composites and bioluminescent bacteria) and instrumentalises them through three advanced computational modelling networks for the predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication and environmental sensing of bio-based materials. It challenges our preconception of design agency as restricted to the traditional cut-off point of building completion, proposing new participatory practices of continual construction to recast the short lifespans of bio-based materials as effective properties of a new sustainable practice. By enabling us to think of buildings as co-present and actively engaged through processes of maintenance and intervention, the project responds to the search for sustainable, more socially conscious and more democratic models of production.",

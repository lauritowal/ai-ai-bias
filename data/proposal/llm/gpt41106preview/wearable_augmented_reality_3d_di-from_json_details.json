        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Wearable Augmented Reality 3D Displays\" (Wear3D), addresses the urgent need to revolutionize wearable display technology. Despite rapid advancements in the field over the past decades, current systems are hampered by a limited field-of-view, technological constraints, and viewing discomfort, primarily due to the absence of 3D depth cues. The Wear3D project aims to overcome these limitations by eliminating bulky relay lenses and providing essential 3D depth cues to ensure a natural viewing experience.\n\nOur objectives include the miniaturization of wearable displays to an eyeglasses form factor and the resolution of the accommodation-convergence conflict which causes perceptual errors. By enabling the eyes to fixate at the correct depth without losing resolution, the proposed technology will markedly improve the quality of interactive 3D augmented reality (AR).\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project are groundbreaking: a natural-looking and interactive 3D experience with a wide field-of-view exceeding 100 degrees, all within a wearable display as natural and unobtrusive as a pair of eyeglasses. These advancements promise to not only extend the state-of-the-art in wearable displays but also to open new research directions for intelligent human-computer interfaces and AR applications across various domains.\n\nThe Wear3D proposal is poised to create a paradigm shift in the way we interact with digital content, propelling us towards a future where augmented reality is seamlessly integrated into our daily lives."

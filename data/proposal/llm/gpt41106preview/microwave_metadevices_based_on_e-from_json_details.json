        "Abstract:\n\nThe MiMETIC project aspires to revolutionize microwave technology through the development of Microwave Metadevices based on Electrically Tunable organic Ion-electron Conductors. This ambitious initiative aims to lay the groundwork for a new era of electrically reconfigurable microwave devices, leveraging the unique properties of organic mixed ion-electron conductors. The project will explore these materials within the 1-100 GHz frequency range, crucial for next-generation wireless communication technologies such as 5G and 6G.\n\nMiMETIC will achieve its vision through three core objectives. First, we will perform comprehensive microwave characterization of organic mixed conductors to understand their electromagnetic response. Second, we will realize reconfigurable metasurfaces on large-area and thin flexible substrates, employing high-throughput deposition techniques. This will facilitate the integration of metadevices into various applications with minimal constraints on form and functionality. Third, we will demonstrate a novel class of microwave devices and metadevices, showcasing the potential of organic mixed conductors to influence fields ranging from wireless communication to untethered bioelectronic interfaces.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include the establishment of a new generation of microwave devices with unprecedented reconfigurability. These metadevices are expected to enhance the pervasiveness and utility of microwave optics, creating new interdisciplinary research opportunities in printed electronics, energy harvesting, organic bioelectronics, and neuromorphic devices. The project's innovations could lead to significant advancements in distributed sensing, wireless bioelectronic interfaces for healthcare, and the exploration of exotic photonics.\n\nIn summary, MiMETIC is poised to expand the technological significance of organic mixed ion-electron conductors, fostering transformative changes across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines, and propelling microwave device technology into a new paradigm of flexibility and functionality."

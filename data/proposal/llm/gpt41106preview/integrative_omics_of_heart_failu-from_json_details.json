        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Integrative omics of heart failure to inform discovery of novel drug targets and clinical biomarkers\" project proposes a cutting-edge research program that leverages the strengths of proteomics, genomics, and epidemiology to address the pressing need for novel therapeutic targets and clinical biomarkers for heart failure. This transformative approach aims to advance precision medicine and tailor individual therapies by identifying subjects at risk for heart disease, assessing heritable components to outcomes, discovering genetic variants associated with risk and outcomes, understanding pathophysiological mechanisms, and evaluating the clinical importance of plasma proteins and genetic variants.\n\nThe research will be conducted on a large scale, utilizing a population-based cohort of 6,000 subjects, nation-wide Swedish disease registers, and more than 70,000 subjects from three generations, including over 3,000 clinical cases. The methods will include comprehensive plasma protein profiling using microarray-based methods and mass spectrometry, genome-wide discovery using resequencing and DNA microarrays, and expression profiling in human heart samples. A novel human cardiomyocyte strain assay will be used to further understand the mechanisms of heart disease.\n\nWith a structured work package system, the research program will systematically profile plasma proteins to identify at-risk subjects, assess heritable components of heart disease outcomes using Swedish registers, discover genome-wide variants, and evaluate the clinical importance of identified proteins and genetic variants. The anticipated outcomes include gaining new insights into the pathophysiology of heart failure, the discovery of actionable drug targets, and the identification of reliable clinical biomarkers.\n\nThis proposal is supported by a robust research infrastructure, including Swedish nation-wide disease registers and large biobanks, and led by an investigator with a strong profile in translational research and experience in genomics, epidemiology, and proteomics. The integration of these omics disciplines sets the stage for a significant impact on the understanding and management of heart failure, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.",
        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Integrative omics of heart failure to inform discovery of novel drug targets and clinical biomarkers\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite significant advances in management, there remains a critical need for novel therapeutic targets and clinical biomarkers that can be used for early detection, risk stratification, and tailored treatment. This proposal outlines an ambitious research program designed to address this gap through the integration of proteomic, genomic, and epidemiological data.\n\nOur objectives are to identify subjects at risk for heart disease, assess heritable components influencing outcomes, discover genetic variants associated with HF risk and progression, understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and evaluate the clinical importance of plasma proteins and genetic variants. We will leverage a population-based cohort of 6000 subjects, nation-wide Swedish disease registers encompassing over 70,000 subjects from three generations, and more than 3000 clinical cases to achieve our goals.\n\nMethodologically, we will employ comprehensive plasma protein profiling using microarray-based methods and mass spectrometry, genomic analysis via resequencing and DNA microarrays, and epidemiological studies. Our work packages are designed to systematically explore each aspect of HF, leading to a detailed understanding of the disease.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this innovative research program include new insights into the pathophysiology of HF, the discovery of novel drug targets, and robust clinical biomarkers. These findings have the potential to significantly impact the field of cardiovascular medicine by enabling precision medicine approaches to HF treatment and prevention. The infrastructure supporting this research includes Swedish nation-wide disease registers and large biobanks, while our investigative team brings a wealth of experience in translational research, genomics, epidemiology, and proteomics.",

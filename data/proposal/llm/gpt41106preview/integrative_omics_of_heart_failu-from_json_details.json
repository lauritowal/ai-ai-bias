        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Integrative omics of heart failure to inform discovery of novel drug targets and clinical biomarkers\n\nHeart failure remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies and diagnostic tools. Our project proposes an innovative approach to tackle this challenge by integrating proteomic, genomic, and epidemiological methods to identify new drug targets and clinical biomarkers for heart failure, ultimately aiming to advance precision medicine in cardiology.\n\nLeveraging a comprehensive population-based cohort of 6,000 subjects, alongside nation-wide Swedish disease registers encompassing over 70,000 individuals from three generations, and more than 3,000 clinical cases, we will conduct in-depth plasma protein profiling using microarray-based methods and mass spectrometry. Concurrently, we will perform genome-wide analysis through resequencing and DNA microarrays, coupled with epidemiological studies, to assess heritable components and discover variants associated with heart failure risk and outcomes.\n\nOur work packages include:\n1. Comprehensive plasma protein profiling to identify subjects at risk for heart disease.\n2. Assessment of heritable components using Swedish registers.\n3. Genome-wide discovery of variants in population-based cohorts.\n4. Expression profiling in human heart samples and a novel cardiomyocyte strain assay.\n5. Evaluation of the clinical importance of plasma proteins and genetic variants.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of our research program encompass new insights into the pathophysiology of heart failure, discovery of drug targets, and identification of clinical biomarkers. We aim to translate these findings into tailored therapies that improve patient outcomes. Our infrastructure includes access to large biobanks and nation-wide disease registers, and our multidisciplinary team has a strong track record in translational research, with expertise in genomics, epidemiology, and proteomics. This project promises to make significant contributions to personalized medicine in heart failure and provide a model for similar studies in other diseases.\n\n(Word count: 275)"

        "Abstract:\n\nThe escalating burden of mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders and PTSD, necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies beyond the moderate efficacy of current psychiatric medications. The \"60-Hz light entrainment to unlock mental health conditions\" project proposes a groundbreaking approach that leverages non-invasive light entrainment to transiently remove the perineuronal net (PNN). PNNs are rigid extracellular matrix structures that stabilize synapses and are implicated in the persistence of certain mental health conditions.\n\nThe proposed research aims to harness 60-Hz light entrainment, discovered as part of an ERC Starting Grant, as a targeted, non-invasive, non-pharmacological, and environmentally friendly therapeutic intervention. In preclinical models, this intervention has shown to improve cognitive performance in mice by enabling microglia to remove PNNs in a brain region-specific manner.\n\nThe primary objectives of the ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant are to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 60-Hz light entrainment in preclinical mouse models of anxiety disorder and PTSD, determine the optimal stage of fear memory formation for intervention, refine treatment length and repetition frequency, and establish physiological parameters as criteria for therapeutic success. The expected outcomes include the refinement of a first prototype, creation of a therapeutic frame for future clinical studies, and laying the groundwork for a spin-off company.\n\nBy targeting PNNs through a novel, non-pharmacological method, this project holds the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for mental health conditions, offering a promising alternative to traditional pharmacological interventions. Its success could transform the approach to mental health treatment, with significant implications for patients, healthcare systems, and society at large."

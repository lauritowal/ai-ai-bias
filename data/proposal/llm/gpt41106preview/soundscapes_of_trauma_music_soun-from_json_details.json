        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Soundscapes of Trauma: Music, Sound and the Ethics of Witnessing\n\nThe proposed project, \"Soundscapes of Trauma: Music, Sound and the Ethics of Witnessing,\" aims to explore the multifaceted role of music and sound in situations of confinement and displacement. This research will span from the Cold War era to the present, focusing on their weaponization, their use as tools of survival, and the ethical implications that arise within this context. The project will adopt a comparative approach across various locations, including Cyprus, Greece, Serbia, Germany, the former Soviet Union, Russia, Iraq, and several South American countries, to provide a diverse and comprehensive analysis.\n\nThe project is innovative in its theoretical framework, which examines the interlocking of politics, ethics, and aesthetics, with a particular focus on the ethics of sound and the ethics of witnessing. This approach will be supported by a cross-disciplinary methodology integrating (ethno)musicology, social anthropology, history, critical theory, human rights law, and sound art.\n\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) brings over a decade of experience in these disciplinary components, ensuring a deep and informed engagement with the subject matter. The expected impact of this research is substantial: it aims to transform the scientific discourse on the social function of music, challenge current perceptions and policies related to detention, and reassess definitions of torture. The project endeavors to provide alternative models for music programs aimed at prisoners and refugees, laying the groundwork for future research and promoting the well-being of both participants and researchers.\n\nThrough its critical analysis, the project, referred to as MUTE, will offer essential insights into the complex interplay between music, sound, and trauma, ensuring the excellence and nuanced scholarship necessary for a comprehensive understanding of these phenomena.

        "**Abstract**\n\nThe project \"Soundscapes of Trauma: Music, Sound and the Ethics of Witnessing\" aims to create a comprehensive and comparative study of music and sound's roles in experiences of confinement and displacement from the Cold War era to the present. The project's central pursuit is to empirically and theoretically investigate the dual nature of music and sound as instruments of oppression and as critical tools for survival. It will explore their usage in various contexts, from psychological warfare to therapeutic interventions in detention centers and refugee camps. \n\nThe project stands out by proposing a novel theoretical framework that intertwines politics, ethics, and aesthetics, with a specific focus on the ethics of sound and the ethics of witnessing. This framework will provide a lens through which the weaponization of music and sound, alongside their empowering capabilities, can be critically analyzed across a range of historical and geographical contexts, including Cyprus, Greece, Serbia, Germany, and countries that constituted the former Soviet Union, as well as Iraq and the Southern Cone of South America.\n\nDrawing on interdisciplinary approaches from (ethno)musicology, social anthropology, history, critical theory, human rights law, and sound art, the project is led by a principal investigator with a decade of dedicated research in these fields. The expected impact of the project includes transforming scientific discourse, reshaping perceptions about music's social functions, reevaluating detention-related policies, reassessing current definitions of torture, and establishing a robust foundation for future research involving music in refugee contexts.\n\nThe relevance of this research is underscored by the ongoing mass asylum seeking in Europe and the increasing number of music-based projects with refugees, highlighting the urgent need to address the well-being of both participants and researchers. MUTE's findings will not only contribute to academic excellence but will also provide critically nuanced insights that can influence policy and practice in the treatment and care of individuals in situations of confinement and displacement.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Soundscapes of Trauma: Music, Sound and the Ethics of Witnessing\n\nThe proposed research project aims to investigate the multifaceted roles of music and sound in situations of confinement and displacement from the Cold War to contemporary times. The study will focus on their weaponization, their function as tools of survival, and the profound ethical challenges they pose in research contexts. The project will adopt a comparative approach, examining case studies in diverse geopolitical locations including Cyprus, Greece, Serbia, Germany, the former Soviet Union and its contemporary state, Russia, Iraq, and several countries in South America.\n\nThe theoretical framework for this research is grounded in the interlocking of politics, ethics, and aesthetics, with a particular focus on the ethics of sound and the ethics of witnessing. This innovative perspective, combined with a multidisciplinary approach that integrates (ethno)musicology, social anthropology, history, critical theory, human rights law, and sound art, seeks to transform scientific discourse and change perceptions about the social function of music.\n\nThe Principal Investigator (PI) brings a decade of immersion in these disciplinary components to the project. The expected impact of the research is substantial: it aims to transform scientific discourse on this subject, change societal perceptions about the role of music, critically reassess detention-related policies, and redefine current understandings of torture. The project also seeks to lay the groundwork for future research on music and refugees, an increasingly pertinent issue given the mass asylum seeking in Europe and the growing number of related music projects.\n\nUltimately, this research will provide alternative models to current music programmes for prisoners and refugees, aiming for enhanced well-being of both participants and researchers. The findings of the project, named MUTE, will contribute to ensuring research excellence and a critically nuanced scholarship that addresses the complexities of trauma, music, and sound.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Soundscapes of Trauma: Music, Sound and the Ethics of Witnessing\" proposes an innovative and interdisciplinary investigation into the roles of music and sound in settings of confinement and displacement from the Cold War era to the present. This critical study aims to explore the dichotomy of music and sound as instruments of both oppression and resilience. It will delve into their weaponization, their significance as tools of survival for individuals in dire circumstances, and the ethical considerations inherent in researching these sensitive applications.\n\nLed by a Principal Investigator with over a decade of expertise in the intersecting fields of (ethno)musicology, social anthropology, history, critical theory, human rights law, and sound art, the project will employ a comparative approach, analyzing cases from diverse global contexts, including Cyprus, Greece, Serbia, Germany, the Soviet Union and its contemporary Russian state, Iraq, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay. This wide-ranging study will illuminate the complex interplay between politics, ethics, and aesthetics, with a particular focus on the ethics of sound and the ethics of witnessing.\n\nThe expected impact of the project is multilayered: it seeks to transform scientific discourse, challenge existing perceptions of music's social functions, reassess detention-related policies, critically evaluate current definitions of torture, and establish a strong foundation for future research on music's role in the experiences of refugees. Furthermore, the proposal is timely and relevant due to the mass asylum-seeking in Europe and the growing number of music research projects with refugees.\n\nMUTE's findings will not only enhance academic scholarship but also contribute to the well-being of participants and researchers, ensuring that the study's outcomes respect ethical boundaries and support the pursuit of well-informed, humane policies and practices. The project promises to offer a new paradigm in understanding the ethical dimensions of music and sound in contexts of trauma and displacement."

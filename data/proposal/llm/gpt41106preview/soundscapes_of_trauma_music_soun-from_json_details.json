        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Soundscapes of Trauma: Music, Sound and the Ethics of Witnessing\" proposes an innovative and interdisciplinary investigation into the roles of music and sound in settings of confinement and displacement from the Cold War era to the present. This critical study aims to explore the dichotomy of music and sound as instruments of both oppression and resilience. It will delve into their weaponization, their significance as tools of survival for individuals in dire circumstances, and the ethical considerations inherent in researching these sensitive applications.\n\nLed by a Principal Investigator with over a decade of expertise in the intersecting fields of (ethno)musicology, social anthropology, history, critical theory, human rights law, and sound art, the project will employ a comparative approach, analyzing cases from diverse global contexts, including Cyprus, Greece, Serbia, Germany, the Soviet Union and its contemporary Russian state, Iraq, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay. This wide-ranging study will illuminate the complex interplay between politics, ethics, and aesthetics, with a particular focus on the ethics of sound and the ethics of witnessing.\n\nThe expected impact of the project is multilayered: it seeks to transform scientific discourse, challenge existing perceptions of music's social functions, reassess detention-related policies, critically evaluate current definitions of torture, and establish a strong foundation for future research on music's role in the experiences of refugees. Furthermore, the proposal is timely and relevant due to the mass asylum-seeking in Europe and the growing number of music research projects with refugees.\n\nMUTE's findings will not only enhance academic scholarship but also contribute to the well-being of participants and researchers, ensuring that the study's outcomes respect ethical boundaries and support the pursuit of well-informed, humane policies and practices. The project promises to offer a new paradigm in understanding the ethical dimensions of music and sound in contexts of trauma and displacement."

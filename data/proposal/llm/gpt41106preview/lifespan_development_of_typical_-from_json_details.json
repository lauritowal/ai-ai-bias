        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'Lifespan Development of Typical and Atypical Multisensory Perception' project, designated as MULTISENSE, proposes an innovative and comprehensive exploration of how multisensory integration abilities develop and vary between individuals with and without synaesthesia across different life stages: childhood, non-elderly adulthood, and older age. Spanning over 48 months and consisting of four work programmes, MULTISENSE aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of multisensory perception and to contribute to our understanding of both typical and atypical perceptual phenomena.\n\nUtilizing a combination of cognitive tests and experimental techniques, the project strives to develop a state-of-the-art assessment tool specifically for child synaesthetes. Through this endeavor, MULTISENSE will evaluate multisensory functions across the lifespan, filling crucial gaps in the literature by developing the nascent field of childhood synaesthesia research and pioneering the novel field of synaesthesia research in aging populations.\n\nSignificant expected outcomes of the project include a comprehensive evaluation of multisensory integration abilities, which will provide valuable feedback to researchers and educational policy makers. Furthermore, the project is set to establish a framework that current and future academics can utilize to further investigate multisensory perception phenomena.\n\nMULTISENSE sets forth a robust agenda to investigate and characterize the trajectory of multisensory perception development, emphasizing the distinct experiences of synaesthetes versus nonsynaesthetes. The knowledge generated from this project is anticipated to have widespread benefits, not only advancing scientific knowledge in the field of neurodevelopment and cognitive neuroscience but also informing educational strategies and interventions for individuals with synaesthesia. Through a multidisciplinary approach, MULTISENSE aspires to make a lasting contribution to the understanding of human sensory experience and its integration over the course of a lifetime."

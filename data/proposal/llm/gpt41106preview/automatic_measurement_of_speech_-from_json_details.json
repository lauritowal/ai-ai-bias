        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal presents the development of an innovative system titled \"Automatic Measurement of Speech Understanding using EEG,\" which aims to revolutionize the evaluation of speech comprehension. Traditional methods require individuals to actively participate by repeating played sentences, demanding labor-intensive manual scoring and specialized speech materials. Our proposed system transcends these limitations by employing electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain responses to natural speech, utilizing automated signal processing to assess speech intelligibility. This fully automatic approach obviates the need for active participation, thereby making it suitable for challenging populations including young children and people with mental impairments.\n\nThe system's advantages are manifold: it is cost-effective, operable outside specialized clinical centers, and directly relates to everyday communication skills. Development goals include the creation of a portable prototype using commodity hardware, validation with test subjects, conducting a market study, and strengthening the intellectual property position. Ultimately, we aim to collaborate with industry partners to develop a commercial product.\n\nOur target endpoints are the setup of industry collaborations and the refinement of a system that can be readily used across various demographics. The project promises to enhance diagnostic capabilities and accessibility, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals and benefiting a wide range of individuals with speech comprehension difficulties.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces a pioneering project, \"Automatic measurement of speech understanding using EEG,\" aimed at developing an innovative system to automatically assess speech understanding through the analysis of brain responses to natural speech. Traditional methods for evaluating speech comprehension, such as playing specially crafted sentences and requiring manual scoring following repetition by the test subject, are labor-intensive, necessitate active participation, and rely on specialized speech material. The proposed system overcomes these limitations by offering a fully automatic measurement that does not require active participation, enabling the testing of various populations including young children and people with mental impairments. The system's practicality is further enhanced as it is designed to be cost-effective and operational outside of specialized clinical centers, thereby relating more closely to everyday communication skills.\n\nThe project's development goals include collaboration with industry to develop a commercial product, creation of a portable prototype using commodity hardware, validation with test subjects, a comprehensive market study, and strengthening of the intellectual property position. The advantages of the proposed system are manifold, promising to revolutionize diagnostics by making it cheaper and more accessible, and laying the groundwork for broader application in clinical practice.\n\nThe proposed strategy includes actively approaching potential industry partners to set up collaborations, ensuring the system meets commercialization goals. The ultimate objective is to provide a tool that can be widely used to improve the understanding of speech processing impairments, benefiting a broad spectrum of individuals who currently face challenges with existing diagnostic methodologies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Automatic Measurement of Speech Understanding using EEG\" project aims to innovate the assessment of speech intelligibility, particularly for populations unable to actively participate in traditional testing methods, such as young children and individuals with mental impairments. Current speech understanding assessments require the test subject to listen to specially crafted sentences, repeat them, and undergo manual scoringâ€”methods that are labor-intensive, require active participation, and rely on specialized speech material. This proposed system circumvents these limitations by using electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain responses to natural speech. Through advanced signal processing techniques, it automatically evaluates speech understanding without the need for active involvement from the subject, thus opening the possibility for broader application beyond specialized clinical settings.\n\nThe project is driven by the medical necessity to accurately gauge speech comprehension in a cost-effective, accessible, and efficient manner. The development strategy includes creating a portable prototype utilizing commodity hardware, validating the system with test subjects, conducting a market study, and strengthening the intellectual property position. In addition, the commercialization goals aim to transform this technology into a viable product through industry collaboration.\n\nThis innovative approach promises a leap forward in speech diagnostics by offering a system that is non-invasive, user-friendly, and directly relatable to everyday communication skills. Ultimately, it paves the way for a more inclusive and equitable assessment of speech understanding across diverse populations.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the development of an innovative system designed for the \"Automatic measurement of speech understanding using EEG.\" The project aims to revolutionize the assessment of speech understanding, particularly for challenging populations such as young children and individuals with mental impairments. Current methodologies necessitate active participation, specialized speech materials, and are labor-intensive, with manual scoring of played sentences repeated by the test subject. These limitations hinder the applicability of speech understanding tests and restrict their use to specialized clinical settings.\n\nThe proposed system addresses these challenges by leveraging fully automated measurements that record brain responses to natural speech and apply advanced signal processing techniques. The key advantages of this novel system include the elimination of the need for active participation, suitability for a broad range of populations, relevance to everyday communication skills, reduction in diagnostic costs, and the capability to operate outside specialized clinical centers.\n\nThe project's development goals are comprehensive, encompassing collaboration with industry partners to create a commercial product, designing a portable prototype using commodity hardware, validating the system with an array of test subjects, conducting a market study, and enhancing the intellectual property position. The strategy involves actively engaging potential industry partners to establish fruitful collaborations.\n\nIn summary, this project promises to deliver a cost-effective, versatile, and user-friendly diagnostic tool, with the potential to vastly improve speech understanding assessments and, consequently, the quality of life for individuals with communication challenges."

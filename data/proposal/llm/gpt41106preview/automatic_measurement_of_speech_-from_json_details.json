        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the development of an innovative system designed for the \"Automatic measurement of speech understanding using EEG.\" The project aims to revolutionize the assessment of speech understanding, particularly for challenging populations such as young children and individuals with mental impairments. Current methodologies necessitate active participation, specialized speech materials, and are labor-intensive, with manual scoring of played sentences repeated by the test subject. These limitations hinder the applicability of speech understanding tests and restrict their use to specialized clinical settings.\n\nThe proposed system addresses these challenges by leveraging fully automated measurements that record brain responses to natural speech and apply advanced signal processing techniques. The key advantages of this novel system include the elimination of the need for active participation, suitability for a broad range of populations, relevance to everyday communication skills, reduction in diagnostic costs, and the capability to operate outside specialized clinical centers.\n\nThe project's development goals are comprehensive, encompassing collaboration with industry partners to create a commercial product, designing a portable prototype using commodity hardware, validating the system with an array of test subjects, conducting a market study, and enhancing the intellectual property position. The strategy involves actively engaging potential industry partners to establish fruitful collaborations.\n\nIn summary, this project promises to deliver a cost-effective, versatile, and user-friendly diagnostic tool, with the potential to vastly improve speech understanding assessments and, consequently, the quality of life for individuals with communication challenges."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Studying the cis-regulatory changes that have shaped human evolution\n\nThe proposed project endeavors to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of human evolution, with a particular focus on cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that have driven phenotypic divergence between humans and our closest relativesâ€”Neanderthals, Denisovans, and non-human apes. This multifaceted study aims to: 1) Generate human-ape hybrid cells to pinpoint expression changes attributable to cis-regulatory variations, 2) Execute massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to functionally map genetic variants distinguishing modern humans and archaic hominins, 3) Develop an innovative methMPRA technique to delineate the role of DNA methylation in gene expression control, and 4) Integrate these data layers to scrutinize human evolutionary trajectories at the sequence, methylation, expression, and phenotypic levels.\n\nThe objectives of this research include the creation of exhaustive resources comprising catalogs of sequence and methylation alterations, the development of a novel method to assess the cis-effects of methylation on gene expression, the construction of new platforms to map human cis-regulation, and the identification of specific genetic modifications underlying distinctive human characteristics.\n\nEmploying a combination of cutting-edge approaches such as hybrid cell creation, MPRAs, and methMPRA, this project is poised to offer unprecedented insights into the regulatory genome. By connecting cis-regulatory changes to human traits, the research will shed light on the genetic architecture of human adaptation and provide a rich resource for the scientific community. The anticipated outcomes promise to refine our understanding of human biology and evolution, with broad implications for fields such as genetics, anthropology, and medicine."

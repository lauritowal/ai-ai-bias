        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Studying the cis-regulatory changes that have shaped human evolution,\" seeks to illuminate the genetic underpinnings of human adaptation and evolution. The project is designed to generate a detailed understanding of how cis-regulatory elements have evolved to shape human traits and how changes in these regions differentiate modern humans from our closest extinct relatives, Neanderthals and Denisovans, as well as from other apes.\n\nThe research team will pursue several interrelated aims: First, they will generate human-ape hybrid cells to identify expression changes driven by cis-regulatory elements. Second, they will employ massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to map the functions of sequence variants that distinguish the different hominins. Third, they will develop methMPRA, an innovative technique, to elucidate the role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression. Finally, they will integrate the resulting data to analyze human evolution comprehensively across sequence variation, methylation patterns, gene expression, and phenotypic changes.\n\nThe objectives of this project are fourfold: to create extensive resources cataloging sequence and methylation changes; to develop a novel method that characterizes the cis-effects of methylation on gene expression; to establish cutting-edge platforms for mapping human cis-regulation; and to identify genetic modifications that are integral to unique human traits.\n\nBy using a combination of hybrid cells, MPRA, and methMPRA methods, the project will construct a powerful framework for studying the cis-regulatory landscape that has been pivotal in human evolution. The outcomes of this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of genetic regulation and the mechanisms of human adaptation, with implications for anthropology, genetics, biology, and medicine.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Studying the cis-regulatory changes that have shaped human evolution\n\nThe project proposed herein aims to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of human evolution, with a focus on the cis-regulatory elements that differentiate humans from their closest relatives, including Neanderthals, Denisovans, and non-human apes. The primary goals of this research are to generate human-ape hybrid cells for the explicit purpose of identifying cis-regulatory expression changes, perform innovative massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to map the functional significance of genomic variants, develop methMPRA to investigate the role of DNA methylation in gene expression, and integrate these data to achieve a comprehensive understanding of human evolution at the level of sequence, methylation, expression, and phenotype.\n\nOur objectives are multi-faceted and include the generation of extensive resources cataloging sequence and methylation changes, the development of novel methodologies for characterizing the cis-effects of methylation on gene expression, the creation of advanced platforms to comprehensively map human cis-regulation, and the identification of specific genetic alterations that underlie distinctive human traits.\n\nThe methodological approaches are cutting-edge and combine the generation of hybrid cells, the application of massively parallel reporter assays, and the novel methMPRA technique. By leveraging these approaches, the project will provide unprecedented insights into the genetic orchestration of human-specific adaptations.\n\nThis research is poised to significantly advance our understanding of human evolution by connecting changes in cis-regulatory elements to functional and phenotypic outcomes. The findings have the potential to illuminate the landscape of human genetic variation and the evolutionary processes that have crafted the modern human genome, thereby offering a deeper understanding of our evolutionary past and present diversity.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Studying the cis-regulatory changes that have shaped human evolution\n\nOur project aims to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of human evolution by focusing on the cis-regulatory changes that have played a pivotal role in human adaptation. The central objectives of this study are to generate a comprehensive catalog of sequence and methylation changes, develop innovative methods to characterize the cis-effects of methylation on gene expression, and construct novel platforms to map human cis-regulation. These efforts will culminate in the identification of genetic variations underlying distinctive human traits.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we will undertake four primary aims: 1) Generate human-ape hybrid cells to ascertain cis-regulatory expression changes, 2) Utilize massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to map the function of variants distinguishing modern humans, Neanderthals, Denisovans, and apes, 3) Develop methMPRA, a novel technique, to map the role of DNA methylation in gene expression, and 4) Integrate data across sequence, methylation, expression, and phenotypic levels to provide a holistic view of human evolution.\n\nOur approaches will leverage innovative technologies such as hybrid cell creation, MPRA, and the development of methMPRA. The anticipated outcome is a multi-dimensional understanding of how cis-regulatory elements contribute to the unique aspects of human biology. This project promises to generate valuable resources for the scientific community, including catalogs of genetic and epigenetic changes that have shaped human evolution. By deciphering the cis-regulatory lexicon of our species, we aim to illuminate the genetic architecture responsible for human-specific traits and thereby advance our understanding of human biology and disease.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Studying the cis-regulatory changes that have shaped human evolution\n\nThe proposed project endeavors to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of human evolution, with a particular focus on cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that have driven phenotypic divergence between humans and our closest relativesâ€”Neanderthals, Denisovans, and non-human apes. This multifaceted study aims to: 1) Generate human-ape hybrid cells to pinpoint expression changes attributable to cis-regulatory variations, 2) Execute massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to functionally map genetic variants distinguishing modern humans and archaic hominins, 3) Develop an innovative methMPRA technique to delineate the role of DNA methylation in gene expression control, and 4) Integrate these data layers to scrutinize human evolutionary trajectories at the sequence, methylation, expression, and phenotypic levels.\n\nThe objectives of this research include the creation of exhaustive resources comprising catalogs of sequence and methylation alterations, the development of a novel method to assess the cis-effects of methylation on gene expression, the construction of new platforms to map human cis-regulation, and the identification of specific genetic modifications underlying distinctive human characteristics.\n\nEmploying a combination of cutting-edge approaches such as hybrid cell creation, MPRAs, and methMPRA, this project is poised to offer unprecedented insights into the regulatory genome. By connecting cis-regulatory changes to human traits, the research will shed light on the genetic architecture of human adaptation and provide a rich resource for the scientific community. The anticipated outcomes promise to refine our understanding of human biology and evolution, with broad implications for fields such as genetics, anthropology, and medicine."

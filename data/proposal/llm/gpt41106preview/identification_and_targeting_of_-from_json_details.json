        "Abstract:\n\nThe current landscape of cancer treatment is hindered by the ineffectiveness of drugs to address the critical issue of cellular heterogeneity in sporadic cancers. This proposal, \"Identification and targeting of somatic changes initiating sporadic cancers,\" aims to revolutionize the approach to cancer therapy by focusing on the early genetic alterations that give rise to cancer. The central hypothesis is that identifying and understanding these initiating changes can lead to the development of more effective treatments.\n\nOur research will employ hypothesis-driven and functional genomics approaches to systematically identify and catalogue the genetic changes that initiate sporadic cancers. We have observed that a subgroup of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) maintains a normal karyotype despite having significant DNA changes smaller than 10Mb. These karyotypically normal DCCs are thought to be central in uncovering the early, functionally relevant genetic changes that are likely shared among cancer progeny cells. By comparing these DCCs with primary tumors and advanced DCCs, which display additional chromosomal changes, we aim to understand the progression of cancer and the genetic basis for cellular heterogeneity.\n\nOur objectives include the identification of the initiating changes, testing the function of these early aberrations, performing functional viability screens to determine the impact of these changes on cancer cell fitness, and developing novel systemic therapies that target the identified critical alterations – the so-called \"Achilles' heel\" of a given cancer. By focusing on these shared, early genetic changes, our research will provide a rationale for the design of combination therapies and adjuvant therapies post-curative resection before the manifestation of metastasis.\n\nThis project promises to fill the gap in the scientific community's understanding of the rationale to attack the cellular heterogeneity in cancer. By selecting the most promising therapeutic targets and designing novel therapies, we aim to improve the survival and quality of life for patients with sporadic cancers.\n\nKeywords: sporadic cancers, cellular heterogeneity, functional genomics, early genetic changes, systemic therapies, karyotypically normal DCCs."

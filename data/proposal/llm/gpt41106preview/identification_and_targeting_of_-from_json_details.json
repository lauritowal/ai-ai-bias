        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Identification and targeting of somatic changes initiating sporadic cancers,\" addresses the urgent need to improve the effectiveness of cancer therapies, which are currently hampered by the challenge of cellular heterogeneity within tumors. Despite advances in cancer treatment, the ineffectiveness of current drugs is widely acknowledged, with a lack of strategies to tackle the genetic diversity of cancer cells postulated as a significant barrier to successful outcomes.\n\nThis research initiative proposes a novel approach to systematically identify and target the early genetic changes that give rise to sporadic cancers. The foundation of the proposal is the premise that cancer initiation is linked to genetic alterations, and that early changes are not only functionally relevant but also likely shared among the mono-clonal progeny of cancer cells. Progression of the disease is thought to be driven by those genetic alterations which either enhance cellular fitness or are neutral.\n\nOur observations have revealed a subgroup of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) that maintain a normal karyotype yet exhibit significant DNA changes smaller than 10Mb. These cells are hypothesized to be central to uncovering the early, shared genetic changes critical for cancer initiation and are distinct from primary tumors and advanced DCCs, which display multiple additional chromosomal alterations.\n\nThe project's goals are to create a comprehensive catalogue of the initiating genetic changes of sporadic cancers, test the function of early aberrations, perform functional viability screens, and ultimately develop novel systemic therapies targeting what could be considered the Achilles’ heel of a given cancer. By focusing on the shared critical alterations, the research aims to provide a rationale for the design of adjuvant therapies that can address cancer cell heterogeneity and prevent manifest metastasis following curative resection.\n\nThis hypothesis-driven, functional genomics approach is poised to fill a significant gap in the scientific community's knowledge, with the potential to revolutionize the selection of therapeutic targets and the design of combination therapies. The project promises to advance our understanding of cancer biology and pave the way for more effective and personalized cancer treatments.",
        "Abstract:\n\nDespite significant advancements in oncology, the effectiveness of current cancer drugs remains limited, largely due to the cellular heterogeneity of tumors. This grant proposal, titled \"Identification and targeting of somatic changes initiating sporadic cancers,\" addresses the critical need for a deeper understanding of the genetic alterations that give rise to sporadic cancers. The project stands on the premise that cancer initiation is associated with certain genetic changes that are functionally relevant and shared among monoclonal cancer progeny. These early changes, often smaller than 10 megabases, are believed to be crucial for the progression of cancer, as they either enhance fitness or are neutral, allowing the cancer cells to survive and proliferate.\n\nOur research will focus on Disseminated Cancer Cells (DCCs) that display a normal karyotype, hypothesizing that these cells are central to uncovering the early genetic changes responsible for cancer initiation. Through hypothesis-driven research and functional genomics, we aim to systematically identify the initiating changes of sporadic cancers, test the function of these early aberrations, and perform functional viability screens to ascertain their role in cancer progression.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop novel systemic therapies that target the identified shared critical alterations – the 'Achilles' heel' of given cancers. By leveraging our observations and innovative approaches, we expect to address the gap in scientific knowledge regarding the rationale to attack cellular heterogeneity in cancer. This project promises to enhance our ability to select the most promising therapeutic targets, design effective combination therapies, and provide successful adjuvant therapy post-curative resection, thereby preventing manifest metastasis and improving patient outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the proposed research represents a novel approach to cataloging the initiating changes of sporadic cancers and developing targeted therapies, addressing long-standing challenges in the field of oncology.",
        "Abstract:\n\nDespite advances in cancer therapy, the effectiveness of current drugs is extremely limited, particularly due to the cellular heterogeneity characteristic of sporadic cancers. The proposed project, \"Identification and targeting of somatic changes initiating sporadic cancers,\" aims to address this critical challenge by systematically identifying and targeting the early genetic changes that give rise to cancer.\n\nOur novel approach is premised on the hypothesis that cancer initiation is associated with specific genetic alterations, and that these early changes are functionally relevant and shared among the monoclonal progeny of cancer cells. Progression of the disease then depends on subsequent genetic changes that either enhance cellular fitness or are selectively neutral. Observations from our preliminary work have identified a subgroup of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) that maintain a normal karyotype but exhibit significant DNA changes smaller than 10Mb, in contrast to primary tumors and advanced DCCs, which show multiple additional chromosomal changes.\n\nWe propose to leverage hypothesis-driven research and functional genomics to (1) create a comprehensive catalogue of the initiating genetic changes in sporadic cancers, (2) assess the functional impact of these early aberrations, (3) conduct functional viability screens to determine the fitness advantage conferred by these changes, and (4) develop novel systemic therapies designed to specifically target the \"Achilles’ heel\" of a given cancer—a shared critical alteration.\n\nThe project's goals are ambitious but achievable, and have the potential to revolutionize the understanding and treatment of cancer by addressing the currently unmet need for rationale-based therapies that can overcome cellular heterogeneity. Success in this endeavor promises to inform the design of combination therapies, improve adjuvant therapy post-curative resection, and ultimately prevent the manifestation of metastasis, dramatically improving outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe current landscape of cancer treatment is hindered by the ineffectiveness of drugs to address the critical issue of cellular heterogeneity in sporadic cancers. This proposal, \"Identification and targeting of somatic changes initiating sporadic cancers,\" aims to revolutionize the approach to cancer therapy by focusing on the early genetic alterations that give rise to cancer. The central hypothesis is that identifying and understanding these initiating changes can lead to the development of more effective treatments.\n\nOur research will employ hypothesis-driven and functional genomics approaches to systematically identify and catalogue the genetic changes that initiate sporadic cancers. We have observed that a subgroup of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) maintains a normal karyotype despite having significant DNA changes smaller than 10Mb. These karyotypically normal DCCs are thought to be central in uncovering the early, functionally relevant genetic changes that are likely shared among cancer progeny cells. By comparing these DCCs with primary tumors and advanced DCCs, which display additional chromosomal changes, we aim to understand the progression of cancer and the genetic basis for cellular heterogeneity.\n\nOur objectives include the identification of the initiating changes, testing the function of these early aberrations, performing functional viability screens to determine the impact of these changes on cancer cell fitness, and developing novel systemic therapies that target the identified critical alterations – the so-called \"Achilles' heel\" of a given cancer. By focusing on these shared, early genetic changes, our research will provide a rationale for the design of combination therapies and adjuvant therapies post-curative resection before the manifestation of metastasis.\n\nThis project promises to fill the gap in the scientific community's understanding of the rationale to attack the cellular heterogeneity in cancer. By selecting the most promising therapeutic targets and designing novel therapies, we aim to improve the survival and quality of life for patients with sporadic cancers.\n\nKeywords: sporadic cancers, cellular heterogeneity, functional genomics, early genetic changes, systemic therapies, karyotypically normal DCCs."

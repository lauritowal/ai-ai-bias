        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe EMPORIGIN project seeks to explore the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy, aiming to determine whether its sub-components are universal across species and cultures. Empathy, the ability to share and comprehend the emotions and thoughts of others, is widely regarded as a key aspect of human nature. The prevailing assumption is that infants and great apes possess a limited capacity for empathy, but this may be due to inadequate research methodologies and a scarcity of focused studies. By employing innovative and comparative techniques such as thermal imaging, pupillometry, and eye-tracking, alongside longitudinal observations and pioneering experiments, EMPORIGIN aims to rectify this research gap. We plan to conduct the first comparative analysis of empathic development in humans and bonobos—our closest living relatives—assessing infants from two distinct human societies, Vanuatu and Samoa, and from both wild and semi-captive bonobo populations.\n\nThese societies have been chosen due to their practice of distributed caregiving, albeit with differences in societal organization and emotional expression, offering a unique opportunity to investigate empathy across varying cultural backgrounds. EMPORIGIN will scrutinize the hypothesis that a fundamental empathic capacity is shared between humans and bonobos, while postulating that humans may exhibit a heightened desire to alleviate the emotional states of others and engage in reciprocal emotional interactions. These human-specific traits could potentially be the catalysts for unique forms of sharing and cooperation seen in our species.\n\nBy integrating cross-disciplinary methods from biology, psychology, ethology, and anthropology, EMPORIGIN aspires to deliver groundbreaking insights into the origins of empathy and challenge the established views on its exclusivity to humans. This research carries the potential to significantly expand our understanding of what underpins one of the most profound human abilities."

However, we lack knowledge about the origins of empathy and to what extent its sub-components reflect species and cultural universals. Studying infants and great apes enables us to identify the developmental and evolutionary origins of empathy and the extent of its human uniqueness. Until now, it has largely been assumed that infants and great apes lack the capacity for empathy. However, this claim may reflect a lack of adequate methodologies and research attention, leaving infant and great ape empathy underestimated. Now, combining novel techniques to investigate empathy comparatively (thermal-imaging, pupillometry and eye-tracking) with longitudinal observations and innovative experiments, EMPORIGIN will overcome this issue to provide the first comparative investigation of empathy development in humans and bonobos, our closest living relatives. Rich datasets on bonobo (wild and semi-captive) infant development and caregiver interactions will be compared to those from human infants in two small-scale, traditional societies – Vanuatu and Samoa. Both societies show distributed-caregiving but vary in societal structure and emotional expressivity. Using a cross-species and cross-cultural approach, EMPORIGIN will deliver step-change insights into empathy development that go far beyond the State-of-the-Art. We will test the hypothesis that humans and bonobos share a core capacity for empathy, but humans diverge in a greater motivation to ameliorate others’ emotional states and a capacity for reciprocal emotional exchange. These capacities could lead to a cascade of human-unique forms of sharing and co-operation. Combining approaches across biology, psychology, ethology and anthropology, EMPORIGIN will advance our understanding of the origins of empathy, one of our most remarkable capacities, and challenge current perspectives about its human uniqueness.",

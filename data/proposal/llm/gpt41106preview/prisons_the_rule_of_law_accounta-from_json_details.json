        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights\" (PRILA) proposal envisions a groundbreaking study to create the first comprehensive account of the mechanisms for securing rights and accountability within European prisons. This timely and critical research aims to document and transform our understanding of the rule of law in the penal context and address the complex experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and staff of accountability bodies. PRILA seeks to elucidate how penal policies and practices can better protect the rule of law and uphold the rights of individuals in prison settings.\n\nThe project has several ambitious objectives. It will document the lived experiences of those within the prison system, scrutinize the adherence to legal standards and principles of fairness, and transform prevailing accounts of the legitimacy of prisons, judicial review, the pains of imprisonment, and the breadth of penal power. By employing a mix of legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods, PRILA will offer a multidisciplinary perspective that integrates public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment.\n\nThe research will examine accountability structures to understand how they manifest penal ideologies or prison regimes and will critically assess whether European conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness are distinctive. The outcomes of this research are expected to provide an in-depth analysis of penal ideologies, the types of prison regimes across Europe, and the practical implementation of accountability measures. Importantly, PRILA aims to support the creation and implementation of improved penal policies and practices that can serve as a model for the protection of rights and the rule of law in prisons across Europe and potentially globally.\n\nPRILA represents a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of legal and judicial conceptions in the penal system and to contribute to a more just and fair penal landscape. This research will be significant for policymakers, legal professionals, and human rights advocates, offering evidence-based insights that can lead to tangible improvements in the lives of those affected by incarceration."

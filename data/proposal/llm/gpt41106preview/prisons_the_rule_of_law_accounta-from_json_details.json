        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights\" (PRILA) project seeks to comprehensively investigate the state of rights, accountability, and the rule of law within European prisons. With the overarching aim to create the first detailed account of these critical aspects in the correctional environment, PRILA will document and analyze the experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and members of accountability bodies to offer transformative insights into the legitimacy of prison operations, judicial review processes, the burdens of incarceration, and the lived experiences of penal power.\n\nThis multidisciplinary research, spanning public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, will employ an integrative approach combining legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods. By examining how accountability structures manifest penal ideologies or prison regimes, PRILA will provide an unprecedented analysis of penal concepts and their application. This research is significant for its potential to advance judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness, particularly within a distinctly European context.\n\nPRILA's focus is on enhancing our understanding of the rule of law in carceral institutions, scrutinizing the processes that ensure fair, transparent, and consistent decision-making and action-taking within prisons. The project will contribute to the creation of improved penal policies and practices, ensuring better protection of the rule of law and rights in prisons.\n\nKey outcomes anticipated from PRILA include a comprehensive account of 'accountability work' as experienced in practice, a nuanced analysis of penal ideologies and prison regimes, and actionable recommendations for policy reform. Ultimately, PRILA aims to support the creation of more humane and legally sound penal systems in Europe, which respect the rule of law and uphold the rights of all stakeholders within the prison context.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights (PRILA)\n\nThe \"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights\" (PRILA) project aims to pioneer a comprehensive exploration of the state of European prisons with respect to the rule of law, accountability, and the protection of prisoners' rights. The central ambition of PRILA is to create the first extensive account of how rights, accountability, and adherence to the rule of law are operationalized and experienced within the unique context of European penal systems.\n\nThe objectives of PRILA are manifold and interconnected. The project will document the lived experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and personnel from accountability bodies in order to understand the implementation and impact of existing structures designed to ensure fair, transparent, and consistent decision-making and actions. PRILA seeks to transform and extend the scholarly understanding of legitimacy in prisons, the pains of imprisonment, and the nuances of penal power. A critical examination of the judicial review of administrative actions and how accountability structures reflect penal ideologies or prison regimes forms an integral part of the research agenda.\n\nPRILA will employ a multidisciplinary approach, harnessing methodologies from public and prison law, human rights, sociology of punishment, and comparative law. The methodological framework will be comprehensive, combining legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods to provide a rich, multifaceted analysis.\n\nExpected outcomes include a distinctive European account of accountability work in practice, an analysis of penal ideologies and prison regimes, and the development of improved penal policies and practices. By advancing judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness, PRILA will contribute significantly to the protection and enhancement of rights in prisons, supporting the creation of more effective and humane penal policies.\n\nPRILA stands as a distinctive project that will illuminate the European experience of penal power, accountability, rule of law, and rights, setting a precedent for future research and policy reforms in the field of prison studies and criminal justice.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights' (PRILA) project seeks to illuminate the under-explored area of rights, accountability, and rule of law within European prison systems. With its acronym reflecting its core thrust, PRILA aims to document the lived experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and the staff of accountability bodies, thereby creating the first comprehensive account of how rights mechanisms and accountability structures operate in practice. This groundbreaking research will transform and extend existing scholarly accounts of legitimacy, judicial review, the pains of imprisonment, and penal power experiences within prisons.\n\nThe project is rooted in a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment. It employs a tripartite methodological framework that includes legal research, qualitative analysis, and quantitative study. Through this blended methodology, PRILA seeks to examine how accountability structures serve as manifestations of penal ideologies or prison regimes, and to advance judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness. This examination is expected to reveal whether and how these concepts are distinctively European, thus contributing to a broader understanding of European penal law and policy.\n\nPRILA's objectives are ambitious and multifaceted. They include documenting and analyzing the experiences of those within the prison system, providing a critical examination of judicial review of administrative actions, and understanding the experiences of penal power from multiple perspectives. The project's ultimate aim is the creation of better penal policies and practices that align with the protection of the rule of law and uphold human rights in prisons.\n\nThe expected outcomes of PRILA are significant. It will provide an unprecedented account of 'accountability work' as experienced in practice, offer a nuanced analysis of penal ideologies and types of prison regimes, and support the development of improved penal policies and practices. By doing so, PRILA will contribute to a fairer and more transparent prison system that respects the rule of law and ensures the rights of all stakeholders within the penal system.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Prisons: the Rule of Law, Accountability and Rights\" (PRILA) proposal envisions a groundbreaking study to create the first comprehensive account of the mechanisms for securing rights and accountability within European prisons. This timely and critical research aims to document and transform our understanding of the rule of law in the penal context and address the complex experiences of prisoners, prison staff, and staff of accountability bodies. PRILA seeks to elucidate how penal policies and practices can better protect the rule of law and uphold the rights of individuals in prison settings.\n\nThe project has several ambitious objectives. It will document the lived experiences of those within the prison system, scrutinize the adherence to legal standards and principles of fairness, and transform prevailing accounts of the legitimacy of prisons, judicial review, the pains of imprisonment, and the breadth of penal power. By employing a mix of legal, qualitative, and quantitative research methods, PRILA will offer a multidisciplinary perspective that integrates public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment.\n\nThe research will examine accountability structures to understand how they manifest penal ideologies or prison regimes and will critically assess whether European conceptions of accountability, rule of law, and fairness are distinctive. The outcomes of this research are expected to provide an in-depth analysis of penal ideologies, the types of prison regimes across Europe, and the practical implementation of accountability measures. Importantly, PRILA aims to support the creation and implementation of improved penal policies and practices that can serve as a model for the protection of rights and the rule of law in prisons across Europe and potentially globally.\n\nPRILA represents a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of legal and judicial conceptions in the penal system and to contribute to a more just and fair penal landscape. This research will be significant for policymakers, legal professionals, and human rights advocates, offering evidence-based insights that can lead to tangible improvements in the lives of those affected by incarceration."

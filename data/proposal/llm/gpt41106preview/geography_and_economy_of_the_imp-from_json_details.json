        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Geography and economy of the imperial properties in the Roman World (from Augustus to Diocletian)\", aims to conduct a comprehensive socio-economic study of the properties owned by Roman emperors between 44 BC and AD 284, a period marked by the reigns of significant figures like Augustus and Diocletian. This project, denoted by the acronym PATRIMONIVM, seeks to fill a critical research gap as there has not been a major survey of this nature since the early 20th century.\n\nFocusing on various property types, including residences, cultivated land, pastureland, woods, mines, quarries, luxury items, and slaves, the project examines their role in public expenditure, their use to confer benefactions, and the local economic repercussions of imperial ownership. It will also explore the geopolitical impact of these properties, such as trans-regional uniformity, economic and cultural integration, and their function as a vector of human mobility and socio-cultural transformation.\n\nPATRIMONIVM's primary objective is to create a comprehensive online relational database that incorporates geodata and synergizes with related databases of known persons, regions, and bibliographic references. This digital tool will be instrumental in assessing the role of imperial investments and the involvement of the emperor’s freedmen in the Roman economy.\n\nThe expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the economic and cultural significance of imperial properties, thereby unveiling patterns of exploitation and integration across the empire. The dissemination strategy comprises the publication of an authoritative history of imperial properties and a series of five books, which will provide academics and the wider public with valuable insights into the Roman world's socio-economic framework.\n\nIn summary, PATRIMONIVM represents a multidisciplinary and comparative approach to understanding the interconnectedness of geography, economy, and imperial power in the Roman empire, offering a fresh perspective on an era that shaped much of Western history.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Geography and Economy of the Imperial Properties in the Roman World (from Augustus to Diocletian)\n\nProject Acronym: PATRIMONIVM\n\nThe PATRIMONIVM project seeks to conduct a groundbreaking, multidisciplinary study of the imperial properties in the Roman world from 44 BC to AD 284, encompassing the reigns of Emperors Octavian/Augustus and Diocletian. The aim of this comprehensive socio-economic study is to fill a significant research gap, as no major survey has been undertaken since the early 20th century on this subject. \n\nThe project will create an online relational database (PATRIMONIVM) that integrates published sources with geodata, and compiles related databases on known persons, regions, and bibliographic references. This database will serve as a foundation for a series of five books, culminating in an authoritative history of the imperial properties. By analyzing residences, cultivated land, pastureland, woods, mines, quarries, luxury items, and slaves, the project will elucidate the role of these properties in the Roman economy, their contribution to public expenditure, confer benefactions, and their broader socio-cultural impact, including the vector of human mobility and trans-regional uniformity.\n\nThe study will test hypotheses regarding the nature of imperial investments and the role of the emperor’s freedmen in property management. By examining patterns of exploitation and ownership roles, the project will offer insights into the geopolitical and economic integration of the empire and the positive effects of cultural integration on peripheral areas.\n\nPATRIMONIVM's expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of the role of imperial properties as a vector for socio-cultural transformation and their contribution to local economic repercussions. Moreover, by creating a comprehensive documentary base, PATRIMONIVM will significantly advance the field of Roman studies and provide a vital resource for future scholarship.\n\nThe project's multidisciplinary and comparative approach promises to redefine our understanding of property management and economic strategy in the Roman Empire, setting a new standard for historiographical analysis in classical studies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Geography and economy of the imperial properties in the Roman World (from Augustus to Diocletian)\" and denoted by the acronym PATRIMONIVM, aims to fill a critical research gap by delivering a comprehensive socio-economic study of the properties owned by Roman emperors. The study will cover an extensive period from 44 BC to AD 284, a time frame that encapsulates the reigns of significant emperors such as Octavian/Augustus and Diocletian.\n\nDespite the importance of imperial properties in the Roman economy, no major survey has been conducted since the early 20th century. PATRIMONIVM seeks to address this deficiency by creating an online relational database that encompasses a myriad of property types such as residences, land, mines, and slaves. This database will integrate published sources with geodata and be complemented by related databases covering known persons, regions, and bibliographic references.\n\nThe project's objectives include a multidisciplinary and comparative study approach to examine the geopolitical and economic impact of imperial properties. This includes assessing their role in public expenditure, benefactions, local economic repercussions, and the influence on trans-regional uniformity and cultural integration. The project hypothesizes that imperial investments and the roles played by the emperor’s freedmen were significant in the socio-cultural transformations of the time.\n\nExpected outputs from PATRIMONIVM comprise an authoritative series of five books and a groundbreaking history of imperial properties, shedding light on their role in the Roman economy and as vectors of human mobility. The study will present new insights into the exploitation patterns of properties and their positive effects on peripheral areas of the empire, contributing significantly to our understanding of the Roman world.\n\nBy leveraging a multidisciplinary framework, PATRIMONIVM promises to become a seminal resource for historians, archaeologists, economists, and scholars interested in the intricate dynamics of imperial power and its economic foundations in ancient Rome.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Geography and economy of the imperial properties in the Roman World (from Augustus to Diocletian),\" designated as PATRIMONIVM, aims to undertake a groundbreaking multidisciplinary and comprehensive socio-economic study of the properties owned by Roman emperors. From residences to mines, these properties were crucial to the empire's economy and played a significant role in the socio-cultural transformation of the Roman World.\n\nDespite the importance of this subject, the last major survey was conducted in the early 20th century, leaving a substantial research gap that PATRIMONIVM seeks to fill. The study period spans from 44 BC to AD 284, covering the reigns of emperors Octavian/Augustus to Diocletian. The project will create an online relational database that includes geodata and is connected with other related databases on persons, regions, and bibliographic references. This innovative digital resource will facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the role and management of imperial properties, considering factors such as public expenditure, benefactions, local economic repercussions, patterns of exploitation, and cultural integration.\n\nPATRIMONIVM will test hypotheses regarding the impact of imperial investments and the role of the emperor’s freedmen in the administration and development of these properties. It will also investigate the properties' role as a vector of human mobility and assess the geopolitical impact they had in achieving trans-regional uniformity and economic and cultural integration.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project include the elucidation of the role of these properties in the Roman economy, their contribution to socio-cultural transformation, and the creation of an authoritative history of imperial properties through a series of five books. This study will significantly enhance our understanding of the Roman World's geopolitical and economic landscape and provide a valuable resource for future research in Roman history and economy."

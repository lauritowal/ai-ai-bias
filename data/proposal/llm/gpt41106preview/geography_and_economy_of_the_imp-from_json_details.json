        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Geography and economy of the imperial properties in the Roman World (from Augustus to Diocletian),\" designated as PATRIMONIVM, aims to undertake a groundbreaking multidisciplinary and comprehensive socio-economic study of the properties owned by Roman emperors. From residences to mines, these properties were crucial to the empire's economy and played a significant role in the socio-cultural transformation of the Roman World.\n\nDespite the importance of this subject, the last major survey was conducted in the early 20th century, leaving a substantial research gap that PATRIMONIVM seeks to fill. The study period spans from 44 BC to AD 284, covering the reigns of emperors Octavian/Augustus to Diocletian. The project will create an online relational database that includes geodata and is connected with other related databases on persons, regions, and bibliographic references. This innovative digital resource will facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the role and management of imperial properties, considering factors such as public expenditure, benefactions, local economic repercussions, patterns of exploitation, and cultural integration.\n\nPATRIMONIVM will test hypotheses regarding the impact of imperial investments and the role of the emperor’s freedmen in the administration and development of these properties. It will also investigate the properties' role as a vector of human mobility and assess the geopolitical impact they had in achieving trans-regional uniformity and economic and cultural integration.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project include the elucidation of the role of these properties in the Roman economy, their contribution to socio-cultural transformation, and the creation of an authoritative history of imperial properties through a series of five books. This study will significantly enhance our understanding of the Roman World's geopolitical and economic landscape and provide a valuable resource for future research in Roman history and economy."

        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal advocates for the creation of a comprehensive Swedish historical database, encompassing an unparalleled collection of disaggregated data from approximately 2,500 Swedish administrative districts for the years 1749 to 1952. The database will codify an extensive array of information including economic activity, political dynamics, population statistics, occupational distribution, educational attainments, social statistics, and records of infrastructure advancements such as railway development. Sweden's unparalleled legacy of consistent and reliable data on population and vital statistics since 1749 offers a unique opportunity to assemble a panel data set of unmatched scope and detail.\n\nThe project stands out globally due to the depth and breadth of data at the local administrative level. It is expected to result in a dataset with up to half a million observations per variable. Such a rich, historical data resource will provide novel insights into the patterns of economic growth, structural changes, and development over a span of two centuries. The high-resolution data will also enable rigorous empirical analyses using advanced identification strategies like instrumental variables and regression discontinuity, enhancing the precision of economic research.\n\nTo illustrate the dataset's potential, preliminary research utilizing a regression-discontinuity approach has already explored how different types of democracies allocate resources post-democratization. This work is in an advanced stage of peer review at the prestigious journal Econometrica. With the newly compiled data, we plan to investigate a series of questions pivotal to understanding economic development and growth, contributing significant value to historical economic research and policy formulation. This grant will provide the means to assemble and disseminate this valuable data, fostering a multitude of research opportunities with both national and international significance."

The finished data set will consist of comprehensive and detailed information on economic activity, political characteristics, vital statistics, occupational structure, education, social and agriculture statistics and infrastructure investments (e.g., railway construction). The comprehensiveness and complete coverage of historical data at the local administrative level is what makes this project unique from an international perspective. Since Sweden has the longest continuous and reliable data series on population and vital statistics in the world,starting as early as 1749, makes it possible to construct a comprehensive panel data set over all 2,500 Swedish local administrative units covering a 200 year period. Consequently, the total number of observations for each variable can be as large as 0.5 million (N=2500×T=200). With this type of rich and disaggregated historical data it become possible to get a better understanding of economic growth, structural transformation and economic development. Also, within-country variation allows for more satisfying empirical identification strategies such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuities or difference-in-differences estimation. As a case in point, I have demonstrated the potential usefulness of the Swedish historical data by addressing the question of whether redistribution of resources towards the poor differs between types of democracy after democratization. The identification strategy is based on a regression-discontinuity design where the type of democracy partly is a function of population size. This paper is currently “revise and resubmit” 2nd round at Econometrica. After collecting the new data, we intend to studying a number of questions related to economic development and growth.",

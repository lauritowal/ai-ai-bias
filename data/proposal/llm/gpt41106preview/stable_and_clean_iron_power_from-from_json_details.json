        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Stable and Clean Iron Power from ICONIC\" project presents a revolutionary advancement in sustainable energy technology through the development of Iron Power â€“ a CO2-free, circular energy carrier with high energy density, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Addressing current challenges associated with iron-based energy carriers such as flame stabilization, iron evaporation, and high NOx emissions, the ICONIC project proposes a novel combustion concept that leverages the recirculation of partly-cooled hot burnt gases, autoignition of iron aerosol mixtures, and suppression techniques to mitigate nanoparticle formation and reduce NOx emissions.\n\nThe ICONIC project will undergo a multi-phase development process, beginning with a small-scale system and progressing to a conceptual Mega-Watt size design. The technology focuses on the combustion of an iron aerosol mixture to generate heat for high-temperature processes, followed by the collection of the resultant iron-oxide powder. This powder will then be regenerated into iron powder using green hydrogen, completing the energy cycle without CO2 emissions. The project aims to produce a well-controllable ICONIC burner that epitomizes the practical application of this concept.\n\nAnticipated results include a proof of concept for a stable and clean iron combustion system, industrial-scale implementation, and a thorough market evaluation. Commercial interest has already been registered from start-ups and potential launching customers, demonstrating the project's viability and potential for widespread adoption.\n\nThe project upholds the ERC MetalFuel program's objectives by developing a disruptive technology with substantial environmental benefits. With the successful development of the ICONIC combustion concept, this project promises to contribute significantly to the sustainable energy market, offering a viable solution for energy storage and transport while mitigating the environmental impact of current energy systems."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: An Integrated Approach to Understanding the Impact of De Novo Mutations on the Mammalian Genome\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to elucidate the role of spontaneous de novo mutations in shaping the mammalian genome, with a focus on their impact on fitness, quantitative traits, and conservation biology. Employing the house mouse as a model organism, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive mutation accumulation (MA) experiment paired with next-generation genome sequencing to characterize thousands of mutation events. The objectives are manifold: to dissect the effects of mutations in the heterozygous state, to determine the molecular spectrum of mutations, and to explain mutation rate variation across the genome. Further, the research will explore the correlations between nucleotide diversity and recombination rate, as well as the density of conserved genomic elements, and develop novel methodologies for assessing the contributions of background selection and selective sweeps to nucleotide diversity.\n\nWe will compare the genomes of MA lines and wild mice to scrutinize the contributions of coding and noncoding mutations to fitness variation and address crucial questions regarding the weakening of natural selection in human populations and the efficacy of selection in endangered species. The project is poised to address a vital gap in our understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative variation, the threat of declining population size in conservation biology, and the distribution of nucleotide variation in the genome.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include significant advances in our understanding of the evolutionary impact of new mutations on phenotypic and molecular diversity in mammals. This study stands to provide critical insights into the genetic mechanisms underpinning biodiversity and adaptation, with significant implications for human health, agriculture, and conservation efforts.\n\nKeywords: de novo mutations, mammalian genome, mutation accumulation experiment, house mouse, genomic variation, conservation biology."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"A Genomic and Macroevolutionary Approach to Studying Diversification in an Insect-Plant Arms Race,\" seeks to untangle the complex coevolutionary dynamics between herbivorous insects and plants within the framework of the escape-and-radiate model. Specifically, the project will focus on the Papilionidae family, commonly known as swallowtail butterflies, and their various host-plant families to understand the mechanisms that drive evolutionary change and diversification.\n\nThe project's objectives include constructing a complete species-level phylogeny for Papilionidae using whole-genome sequencing, calibrating this phylogeny with time, and combining it with species traits to estimate ancestral host-plant preferences and subsequent host-plant shifts. Additionally, we aim to recreate dated phylogenies of the main host-plant families to assess parallel diversification trends with the butterflies, estimate diversification rates in different evolutionary scenarios, and conduct a genomic survey to pinpoint genes under positive selection that are related to host-plant shifts. A pivotal aspect of our approach involves characterizing the transcriptomes of both caterpillars and their host plants to identify genes implicated in the evolutionary arms race, comparing these across the swallowtail phylogeny.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this multidisciplinary research include a comprehensive species-level phylogeny for Papilionidae, detailed reconstructions of host-plant family phylogenies, and diversification rate estimates for various clades. Furthermore, it will lead to the identification of genes under positive selection associated with host-plant shifts and a more precise understanding of the insect-plant arms race through characterized transcriptomes.\n\nOur research has the potential to answer critical evolutionary questions on the long-term mechanisms that underpin ecological interactions, providing valuable insights into the macroevolutionary patterns and processes that have shaped current biodiversity. Through this project, we aspire to develop a robust macroevolutionary and genomic framework that will significantly contribute to the study of coevolution and the origin and evolution of complex ecological relationships."

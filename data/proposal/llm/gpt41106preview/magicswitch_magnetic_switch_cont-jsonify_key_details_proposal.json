Governments, healthcare facilities, commercial businesses and individuals are all storing information in electronic form. This has led to the emergence of digital and cloud-based technologies. The ability to use information more efficiently has resulted in a rapid increase of the value of information. Indeed, many organizations today recognize information as their most valuable asset. However, with the Big Data revolution, information faces new, and potentially more damaging, security threats: 88 records were lost or stolen every second in 2017, and this number is expected to increase year-over-year. Thus, enhancing robustness and security in data storage systems is one of the major challenges in our modern society. Our vision for the near future is to turn the scientific output of the ERC Consolidator SPIN-PORICS into a new type of storage memory. MAGIC-SWITCH will deliver the prototype and business case for a new type of secure storage memory, at an industrial-relevant scale, in which “pre-selected” stored data can be made visible or hidden by applying a specific voltage sequence (which can be randomized, similar to a password). Magneto-ionic effects will govern the operation of this memory system. This novel storage device could be used to store sensitive data (e.g., healthcare data that are mandatory to be archived for several years) or encryption keys. The specific goal of this PoC project is to take the initial steps towards this vision by building a prototype (moving from Technology Readiness Level TRL 3 to 5), standardizing its manufacturing process and creating a business case for its commercial exploitation (including a pitch that can be used to close new partnerships or in fund-raising)."

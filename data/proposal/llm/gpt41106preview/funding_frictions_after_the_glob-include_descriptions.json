        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the critical impact of funding frictions on the financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companiesâ€”a topic that has gained prominence following the severe market instabilities experienced during the 2007-2009 Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic-induced turmoil in March 2020. Funding frictions, which can hamper institutions' ability to borrow or refinance debt, pose systemic risks that can lead to defaults and financial instability. Despite their significance, funding frictions have often been overlooked in pre-crisis research. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by analyzing how post-crisis market developments have influenced funding frictions and their consequential effects on financial entities. The research will concentrate on four key post-GFC changes: the surge in deficits in developed economies, the enhanced regulation of Money Market Mutual funds, the trend of pension risk transfers from firms to insurance companies, and the implementation of stringent bank regulations as part of the Basel III accords. By examining these factors, the study will provide insights into their effects on funding costs and access to credit markets. The findings are expected to assist sovereign entities in managing their growing debt burdens and offer policy makers a nuanced understanding of the effects, including potential unintended consequences, of regulatory measures. This research will contribute to the development of informed strategies to mitigate funding risks and enhance financial stability, benefiting a broad range of stakeholders from financial institutions to national policy architects."

In extreme situations, such as the 2007-2009 global financial crisis (GFC) or the market turmoil in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, funding frictions can lead to the default of otherwise healthy institutions and destabilize the entire financial system. While earlier research (pre-GFC) tends to disregard funding frictions, the enormous risk associated with these market tensions highlights that a deeper understanding of funding frictions is crucial - it can guide policy makers to determine their optimal responses to future crises and help institutions to reduce their funding risk. In this project, I will investigate how funding frictions affect financing conditions for countries, banks, pension plans, and life insurance companies. While funding frictions can, in the most extreme cases, lead to the bankruptcy of otherwise healthy entities, they usually first manifest through elevated costs for external financing, shorter debt maturities, or a lack of access to certain credit markets. Focusing on these aspects, I will investigate the following question: How did the market developments since the GFC affect funding frictions for countries, banks, pension funds, and insurance companies? More specifically, I examine four post-crisis changes in financial markets - (i) ballooning deficits in most developed economies, (ii) tighter regulation of Money Market Mutual funds, (iii) pension risk transfers with firms transferring their defined benefit (DB) pension plans to life insurance companies, and (iv) tighter bank regulation (as implemented in the Basel III capital accords) - and study their impact on funding costs and access to credit markets. The results can help sovereigns with managing their increasing debt levels and inform policy makers about the (potentially unintended) consequences of regulatory changes.",

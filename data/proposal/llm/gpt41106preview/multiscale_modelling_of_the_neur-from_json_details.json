        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Multiscale Modelling of the Neuromuscular System for Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation\n\nThe proposed project aims to revolutionize the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) through the development and implementation of a sophisticated multiscale model for closed-loop Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). The current open-loop DBS systems do not optimally cater to the fluctuating nature of PD symptoms and therapy needs. The objectives of this research are to improve long-term stimulation outcomes, limit side-effects, extend battery life, increase therapeutic efficacy, reduce costs, and minimize energy consumption.\n\nThe core of our research is to design a new multiscale model that will accurately simulate neural sensing and stimulation, account for the electric field around the DBS electrode, and predict the effect on individual neurons as well as neural networks. This model will also be capable of generating muscle force models, thereby providing a comprehensive tool for understanding and manipulating the neuromuscular system in PD. The integration of multiple temporal and spatial scales will allow the model to accommodate the nonlinear nature of the system and manage both short- and long-term changes in system behavior.\n\nTo validate the model, we will conduct a series of experiments to ensure its accuracy and reliability. The expected outcomes include the identification of new biomarkers of neural activity, which will enable the design of a new control strategy for closed-loop DBS, providing significant improvements in patient outcomes. The research will also offer new insights into the mechanisms of PD and DBS, ultimately leading to more effective and efficient therapeutic strategies.\n\nThis innovative approach has the potential to transform the way electrical stimulation devices are used in implanted therapies, changing the standard of care for PD patients. By developing a model that predicts and responds to patient-specific needs, our research aims to reduce the burden of PD on individuals and society as a whole."

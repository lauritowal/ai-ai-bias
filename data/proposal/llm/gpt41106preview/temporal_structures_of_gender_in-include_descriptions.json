        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to expand the sociological understanding of welfare regimes and their interaction with gender roles beyond the established Western-centric framework. The pioneering work of Esping-Andersen identified 'three worlds' of welfare regimes, but these are primarily based on Western societal models. Our research aims to introduce a global perspective by investigating emerging patterns of welfare regimes and gender inequalities in East Asian societies, namely China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. \n\nThe project, entitled GenTime, is designed to study gender inequality through the lens of time use across both East Asian and Western societies. By analyzing newly accessible cross-national and historical comparative time diary data, alongside household panel data, we intend to explore the gender division of labor within various welfare regimes. GenTime will focus on three key areas: the division of unpaid work within households, the role of welfare regimes in shaping domestic labor trends, and the impact of time use on later family outcomes from a life course perspective.\n\nA significant aspect of our research will examine how modern technology affects care provision and domestic labor, potentially influencing trends in gender inequality. We aim to determine whether East Asian welfare regimes constitute a unique typology and how these regimes contribute to the systematic differences between men and women in terms of daily activity engagement and leisure enjoyment.\n\nUltimately, this project will provide valuable insights into the gendered division of labor and social inequality across different cultural and social traditions. It will also contribute to policy discussions by highlighting the importance of time use as a critical element of public policy. The findings are expected to have broad implications for the design and implementation of social welfare policies that more effectively address gender disparities in both Western and non-Western contexts."

But these worlds, and later developments in this field, including the extension and application of the framework to gender roles, derive exclusively from Western models. What will emerge as we seek to develop a global perspective on other models of welfare regimes and how they handle gender inequalities? We will answer this question, using newly available data deriving from beyond the conventional Anglophone and European theatres: from China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to explore patterns emerging from other cultural and social traditions. GenTime will be a study of gender inequality in patterns of time use across East Asian and Western societies. We will investigate the development trajectories and provision of unpaid work in different welfare regimes, and the systematic differences between men and women in the amount of time they spend on daily activities and their daily life schedules. It will examine time use as an important parameter of public policies. We will establish if East Asian regimes represent a distinct typology. The project will shed new light on the gender division of labour and social inequality across different regime types. Furthermore, we will examine how the use of modern technology in care provision and domestic labour may shape the trends in gender inequality. We will investigate the impacts on gender differences in leisure time and enjoyment in daily activities. High quality cross-national and historical comparative time diary data and household panel data will be analysed to study gender inequality 1) at the household level on how couples divide their roles in work and family; 2) at the societal level on the role of welfare regimes in shaping the trends in domestic division of labour; and 3) from a life course perspective on the impacts of time use on later family outcomes.",

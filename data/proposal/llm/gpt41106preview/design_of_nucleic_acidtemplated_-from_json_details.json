        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Design of Nucleic Acid-Templated Ordered Protein Assemblies\n\nThe proposed research seeks to pioneer the development of a novel class of designed nanomaterials through the integration of protein design and DNA nanotechnology. The aim is to leverage the synergistic potential of these two fields to fabricate ordered protein assemblies with precise control over size, shape, and composition—features currently unattainable by either technology alone.\n\nThe project will unfold in three interrelated approaches. The first approach will utilize nucleic acids as templates to define the dimensions and introduce addressability into protein structures, thereby allowing for the genetic encoding and in-cell assembly of these complex materials. The second approach extends the complexity of the templates by incorporating both DNA and RNA nanostructures. This will facilitate the development of two-dimensional and three-dimensional protein assemblies that mirror the shape of the nucleic acid template, possessing enhanced rigidity, stability, and biological functionality. A library-scale screening will couple phenotypes, such as size and patterning, to genotypes, which embodies the sequence of the nucleic acid, enabling phenotype-to-genotype coupling.\n\nThe third approach positions the nucleic acid as a mold, which is not incorporated into the final assembly, but used to catalyze the assembly of nanoparticles. By employing a single mold for multiple particles, this method offers a scalable solution for the creation of nanomaterials.\n\nThis research project promises to unlock unprecedented property access by combining the addressability and precision of DNA nanotechnology with the structural diversity and functionality of protein design. The anticipated outcome is the establishment of a transformative platform for the design of nanomaterials with significant implications for materials science, biotechnology, and medicine.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project titled \"Design of Nucleic Acid-Templated Ordered Protein Assemblies\" aims to pioneer a revolutionary class of designed nanomaterials by synergistically combining the fields of protein design and DNA nanotechnology. This innovative approach will enable precise control over the size, shape, and composition of protein assemblies, thereby unlocking novel properties that are currently unattainable by either technology in isolation.\n\nThe proposed research will pursue three main approaches: (1) Utilizing nucleic acids as templates to define the dimensions and addressability of protein structures, thereby facilitating their assembly within living cells. This will be achieved through genetic encoding, ensuring that the protein components are structurally and mechanically tailored for specific functions. (2) Exploiting complex DNA and RNA templates to shape two- and three-dimensional protein assemblies that reflect the template nanostructure's shape. This will result in assemblies with enhanced rigidity, stability, and biological functionality. A library-scale screening method will be employed to couple phenotypes—such as size, shape, and patterning of functional domains—with the genotype of the nucleic acid sequence. (3) Using nucleic acids as molds for protein assembly, with DNA origami technology catalyzing the nanoparticle assembly process. This approach ensures scalability by utilizing a single mold for the creation of multiple nanoparticles.\n\nBy integrating the capabilities of DNA nanotechnology for defining precise nanostructures with the versatile functionality of protein design, this project promises access to an expanded property space of nanomaterials. The success of this endeavor will have far-reaching implications for various applications, including biomedicine, materials science, and nanorobotics. Through these groundbreaking approaches, the project aims to chart new territory in the realm of nanoscale engineering and establish a foundation for future innovations in the field.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Design of Nucleic Acid-Templated Ordered Protein Assemblies,\" aims to pioneer a new class of designed nanomaterials at the intersection of protein design and DNA nanotechnology. The initiative seeks to harness the capabilities of both fields to manipulate the size, shape, and composition of protein assemblies with unprecedented precision. By leveraging the structural and mechanical properties inherent in proteins and the defining dimensions and addressability provided by nucleic acids, the project envisions the creation of novel materials with functionalities not accessible through single-technology approaches.\n\nThe proposal outlines three distinct but synergistic approaches. The first focuses on defining protein structural and mechanical properties within a nucleic acid template that introduces addressability and dimensionality. This method includes the possibility of genetic encoding, allowing for in-cell assembly of the designed materials. The second approach involves the use of complex DNA and RNA templates to control various factors such as assembly size, shape, and biological functionality. This process will be supported by library-scale screening methods and phenotype-genotype coupling to optimize the design.\n\nThe third approach positions nucleic acids as molds that are not incorporated into the final assembly but are instrumental in determining the size and composition of the protein assembly. This approach also addresses scalability by utilizing a single mold to catalyze the assembly of multiple particles. The synergy between DNA nanotechnology and protein design is critical, providing access to properties such as rigidity, stability, and biological functionality that are unavailable to single technologies.\n\nOverall, this project represents a novel convergence of DNA nanotechnology and protein design, offering the potential to advance the field of nanomaterials and open up new avenues for applications in biotechnology, materials science, and medicine. The proposed project's innovative approaches promise to expand the toolbox for nano-engineering and stimulate further research in this interdisciplinary domain.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Design of Nucleic Acid-Templated Ordered Protein Assemblies,\" aims to pioneer a new class of designed nanomaterials through an innovative synergy of protein design and DNA nanotechnology. By leveraging the precision of nucleic acid templates, this initiative seeks to meticulously control the size, shape, and composition of protein assemblies to achieve functionalities inaccessible by either technology alone.\n\nOur approach involves three distinct strategies to manipulate protein assemblies: 1) Utilizing nucleic acids to define dimensions and introduce addressability within the assembly process, allowing for the genetic encoding and in-cell assembly of protein structures with defined structural and mechanical properties. 2) Exploring complex DNA and RNA templates to control factors such as size, shape, and addressability, resulting in two- and three-dimensional assemblies that reflect the shape of the templating nucleic acid nanostructure. These assemblies are designed to exhibit enhanced rigidity, stability, and biological functionality, with the potential for library-scale screening and phenotype-genotype coupling. 3) Employing nucleic acids as molds, catalyzing the assembly of nanoparticles without incorporating themselves into the final structure, offering a scalable solution by using one mold for multiple nanoparticles.\n\nThe combination of protein design and DNA nanotechnology in this project promises to access properties previously unavailable to single technologies, enhancing our ability to design nanomaterials with specific, desired characteristics. By transcending the limitations of traditional approaches, this research has the potential to revolutionize the field of nanomaterials and open up new avenues in biomedical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology.\n\nThe project's success will be ensured by a cross-disciplinary team with expertise in protein engineering, nucleic acid chemistry, and nanofabrication, setting the stage for groundbreaking advancements in the design of ordered protein assemblies."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"BiogENesis and Degradation of Endoplasmic Reticulum proteins\" project proposes a groundbreaking study of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein network in eukaryotic cells. By leveraging the power of Cryo-electron tomography (CET) and advanced computational analysis, this research seeks to elucidate the complex processes of protein biogenesis and homeostasis within the ER with subnanometer resolution. The project's objectives are to reveal the molecular intricacies of the ER protein biogenesis and homeostasis, examine the structure and dynamics of the ER translocon, and provide unprecedented insights into the cotranslational import, N-glycosylation, stabilization, folding, and oligomerization of model substrates such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed research will investigate the degradation pathways of misfolded ER proteins via the cytosolic 26S proteasome using cytomegalovirus-induced depletion of MHC class I as a model system. It will also assess the structural response of the ER-bound translation machinery during ER stress, particularly focusing on IRE1-mediated mRNA degradation mechanisms. An innovative aspect of this project is the improvement of 'in silico purification' techniques, which is expected to enhance the study of various states of native macromolecules.\n\nThis project stands to make significant contributions by developing a new approach to the structural biology of membrane-associated processes. The implications of this research are far-reaching, with the potential to advance our understanding of viral immune evasion mechanisms, glycosylation disorders, and diseases associated with chronic ER stress, such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions. By providing a comprehensive blueprint of ER protein networks, this proposal aims to facilitate breakthroughs in molecular biology that can translate into therapeutic strategies for a range of diseases."

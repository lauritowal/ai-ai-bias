        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Computational Dissection of Effective Circuitry and Encoding in the Retina for Normal and Restored Vision\" (CODE4Vision) project proposes a groundbreaking investigation into the complex neural networks that process and encode visual information in the retina. This project addresses the urgent need for vision restoration therapies in individuals with photoreceptor degeneration, a debilitating condition that impairs visual processing capabilities. By utilizing innovative methods such as artificial stimulation of retinal neurons and optogenetics, CODE4Vision aspires to unravel the intricate nonlinear operations and dynamics of approximately 30 parallel signaling streams from retinal ganglion cells.\n\nThe project's objectives include identifying the effective connectivity between ganglion cells and bipolar cells, and determining the specific features of information processing between these neuronal layers. Employing a suite of advanced techniques, including computational statistics, machine learning, closed-loop experiments, and simultaneous bipolar and ganglion cell recordings, the project seeks to characterize the layout of bipolar cell inputs to ganglion cells and to comprehend the diverse neural code of the retina. These approaches are tailored to account for the nonlinear and dynamical characteristics of retinal connections, thereby offering a more accurate representation of natural retinal activity.\n\nThe expected outcomes of CODE4Vision are twofold: the development of new models elucidating how the retina encodes natural visual stimuli, and the establishment of stimulation schemes for optogenetic vision restoration that mimic this natural encoding in mouse models. The anticipated advancements from CODE4Vision have the potential to significantly impact the field of neuroscience, particularly in the realm of sensory processing and neuroprosthetics, paving the way for transformative vision restoration strategies.",

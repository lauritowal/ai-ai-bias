        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Computational Dissection of Effective Circuitry and Encoding in the Retina for Normal and Restored Vision\" (CODE4Vision) project aims to revolutionize our understanding of neural circuitry in the retina and to leverage this knowledge for the development of innovative vision restoration therapies. This initiative addresses the critical need to help patients with photoreceptor degeneration by reconstructing the natural transmission of visual information to the brain.\n\nAt the core of CODE4Vision is the challenge to unravel the complex nonlinear operations and dynamics across the ~30 parallel signaling streams emanating from retinal ganglion cells. By identifying the effective connectivity between ganglion cells and their presynaptic bipolar cells and determining the unique features of information processing between these neuronal layers, the project seeks to decode the intricate neural language of the retina.\n\nEmploying a diverse array of techniques, including computational statistics, machine learning, closed-loop experiments, and simultaneous bipolar and ganglion cell recordings, CODE4Vision is poised to develop new models that accurately represent how the retina encodes natural visual stimuli. These models will inform the creation of tailored stimulation schemes for optogenetic vision restoration, initially tested in mouse models.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project are not only of theoretical significance but carry profound implications for the practical application of vision restoration therapies. By dissecting the retina's encoding strategies and recreating natural retinal activity, CODE4Vision will pave the way for the development of treatments that can restore sight to those who have lost it due to degenerative conditions, thus significantly enhancing their quality of life."

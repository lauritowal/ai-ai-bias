        "Abstract:\n\nThe POLLCLIM project, \"Plant adaptation in a changing pollination climate,\" aims to unravel the consequences of shifts in pollination dynamics for animal-pollinated plants. With pollination climates altering globally, the adaptive responses of plants to these changes remain poorly understood. This project seeks to illuminate how variations in pollinator assemblages contribute to natural selection and influence the evolutionary trajectories of plants.\n\nPOLLCLIM will develop a pioneering conceptual framework that underscores the likely non-additive contributions of individual pollinator species to the selection pressures on plant traits. The project will focus on a functionally diverse set of pollinators visiting a pollination-generalized wildflower in Southern Scandinavia. Through a multifaceted approach combining observational field studies of 50 plant populations, controlled single-pollinator flight-cage experiments, and tailored statistical modelling, POLLCLIM will generate empirical data on phenotypic adaptation and elucidate spatio-temporal variation in selection.\n\nQuantitative-genetic analyses will be employed to evaluate how individual pollinators shape plant traits and to extrapolate these effects to larger evolutionary patterns of population divergence. Annual population surveys and well-replicated selection studies will offer a detailed perspective on the interplay between natural selection and genetic constraints.\n\nExpected outcomes include a deeper understanding of plant responses to changing pollination climates and novel insights into the role of selection in both microevolution and macroevolution. By examining the impacts of pollinator-mediated selection, POLLCLIM will contribute significantly to the fields of ecology, evolution, and conservation biology, providing a framework for predicting and managing the evolutionary responses of plant populations in an era of global environmental change."

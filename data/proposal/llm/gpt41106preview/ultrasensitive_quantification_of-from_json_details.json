        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Ultrasensitive Quantification of Proteins using DNA Aptamer Amplification and Semiconductor Technology\n\nWith the decline in life expectancy since 2015 in regions such as the EU and US, largely attributed to preventable diseases linked to obesity—a condition affecting 40% of worldwide adults and 13% classified as obese—it is imperative to develop innovative health monitoring solutions. Current non-invasive, cost-effective treatments are insufficient, highlighting the need for technological advancements in the regulation of food metabolism. Leptin, a hormone playing a crucial role in regulating appetite and weight, has been identified as a key biomarker for body fat mass and diet efficiency. Its concentration changes more significantly than weight loss, making it an ideal candidate for monitoring through non-invasive means such as saliva.\n\nBuilding upon a foundation laid by an ERC Synergy Grant, our proposal, \"Ultrasensitive Quantification of Proteins based on Amplification of DNA Displaced from DNA Aptamer Duplex using Semiconductor Technology,\" aims to further develop a point-of-care (PoC) platform. This platform leverages an aptamer-based approach for the quantitative detection of protein molecules, employing real-time Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification and Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor lab-on-chip arrays.\n\nThe proposed technology boasts key advantages such as linear label-free detection, ultrasensitivity, reduced complexity, faster time-to-result, and lower cost. These features position our platform as one of the most sensitive PoC techniques for protein quantification. With a patent currently under preparation, the funding requested will be instrumental in developing this PoC platform, which has potential applications in obesity, anorexia, and appetite control, among other health conditions.\n\nIn summary, this project represents a significant leap forward in the management of obesity and related metabolic disorders, providing a novel molecular method for broader protein target quantification and highly sensitive PoC techniques for protein quantification.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal entitled \"Ultrasensitive Quantification of Proteins based on Amplification of DNA Displaced from DNA Aptamer Duplex using Semiconductor Technology\" addresses a critical challenge in the field of biomedical diagnostics: the need for highly sensitive, non-invasive, and cost-effective methods for the detection and quantification of biomarkers such as leptin, which plays a crucial role in regulating appetite and weight. Given the alarming statistics that show a decline in life expectancy since 2015 in regions like the EU and US, and with over 40% of adults overweight and 13% obese, there is an urgent need for improved obesity management and prevention strategies.\n\nLeveraging the work funded by an ERC Synergy Grant, this project aims to develop a point-of-care (PoC) diagnostic platform using real-time Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) and Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) lab-on-chip array technology. The novel molecular method we propose enables broader protein target quantification and provides a highly sensitive PoC technique for the quantification of proteins such as leptin. Leptin levels, which correlate with body fat mass and change at a rate greater than weight loss, are measurable in saliva, offering a non-invasive monitoring method that can be used to gauge diet efficiency.\n\nOur PoC platform will advance the current state of obesity treatments by offering a solution that is linear and label-free, ultrasensitive, and reduces both complexity and time-to-result. Additionally, the assay promises to be more cost-effective than existing alternatives. The project will further develop patented aptamer-based technology to enhance protein detection capabilities, with potential applications extending beyond obesity to conditions such as anorexia and other appetite control disorders.\n\nThe grant funds will be used to develop this innovative PoC platform, which is poised to revolutionize the field of metabolic regulation and contribute significantly to human health by enabling early detection and more effective management of obesity and related conditions.\n\nKeywords: Protein quantification, obesity, leptin, point-of-care, lab-on-chip, ISFET, LAMP, aptamer, non-invasive diagnostics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe “Ultrasensitive Quantification of Proteins based on Amplification of DNA Displaced from DNA Aptamer Duplex using Semiconductor Technology” project is a cutting-edge research initiative aimed at confronting the global health challenge posed by obesity, a condition affecting 40% of adults worldwide and contributing to a third of preventable premature deaths since 2015 in regions like the EU and US. Central to obesity is the hormone leptin, which regulates appetite and weight, and is directly correlated with body fat mass. Despite its significance, current non-invasive, cost-effective treatments for obesity are lacking, with an urgent need for improved monitoring of leptin to guide dietary efficiency and treatment.\n\nLeveraging previous work supported by an ERC Synergy Grant, this project proposes the development of a point-of-care (PoC) platform utilizing an aptamer-based approach for the quantitative detection of leptin. This innovative technology employs real-time Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) and Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) lab-on-chip arrays to achieve linear label-free detection, ultrasensitive responsiveness, and reduced complexity and cost. Saliva will be used as the monitoring medium, taking advantage of the established correlation between salivary and plasma leptin levels.\n\nThe project's goal is to create one of the most sensitive PoC techniques for protein quantification, addressing a gap in the market for non-invasive and cost-effective obesity treatments. The technology platform promises a reduced time-to-result, making it a potentially transformative tool for managing obesity, anorexia, and other appetite control disorders. With a patent currently under preparation, the funding sought will enable the development of the PoC platform, which has the potential to revolutionize the way leptin and other proteins are monitored, leading to better health outcomes for millions of individuals worldwide.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe escalating prevalence of obesity, with 40% of worldwide adults being overweight and 13% classified as obese, has become a critical public health concern. Obesity is linked to an array of diseases and has been associated with a decline in life expectancy since 2015. Currently, there are no non-invasive, cost-effective treatments that can be widely implemented. Leptin, a hormone pivotal in regulating appetite and body weight, has emerged as an essential biomarker for monitoring dietary efficiency, as its concentration directly correlates with body fat mass and changes more significantly than weight loss itself. The ability to precisely measure leptin levels in saliva, which correlates with plasma levels, could revolutionize obesity prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nOur project, titled \"Ultrasensitive Quantification of Proteins based on Amplification of DNA Displaced from DNA Aptamer Duplex using Semiconductor Technology,\" builds upon preliminary work funded by an ERC Synergy Grant and aims to develop a point-of-care (PoC) platform for the ultrasensitive detection of leptin. By leveraging the real-time Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) technique and Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) lab-on-chip arrays, the proposed technology platform offers several advantages, including linear label-free detection, reduced complexity, faster time-to-result, and lower costs. The innovative approach combines the specificity of aptamer-based detection with the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification, a method currently under patent preparation.\n\nThe funding requested will facilitate the development of one of the most sensitive PoC techniques for protein quantification to date. This technology has the potential for broad applications, including obesity management, appetite control in conditions such as anorexia, and other diseases where protein quantification is relevant. Our aim is to provide a transformative tool for healthcare professionals, enabling them to monitor and manage obesity and related disorders effectively."

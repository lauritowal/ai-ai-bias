        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Sequence similarity networks: a promising complement to the phylogenetic framework to study evolutionary biology,\" seeks to revolutionize the analysis and understanding of molecular sequences within the context of evolutionary biology. Confronting the challenge posed by the exponential growth of molecular sequence data, which includes organisms, environmental samples, and mobile genetic elements, the project proposes the development of large complex similarity networks as an innovative approach to complement existing phylogenetic trees and networks.\n\nOur team aims to identify and study chimeric genes and genomes, detect and analyze shared genetic goods among gene families and microbial communities, test genetic diversity in environmental sequences, and improve the statistical framework for the comparison of similarity networks. By leveraging the structure of these networks, which are expected to consist of a few million nodes and tens of millions of edges, we anticipate providing a more inclusive and rapid analytical capability for both divergent and conserved sequences.\n\nThe project draws inspiration from the analytical methods employed in social and regulatory network studies to offer a new perspective in evolutionary biology, where the importance of sequence comparison is fundamental. The methodology involves comparative analyses of sequences derived from various origins and aims to produce an additional comparative framework for evolutionary biology.\n\nExpected outcomes include the establishment of new methods for the detection of environmentally and genomically derived sequences and a novel description of the structure of genetic diversity on Earth. This research promises fast, inclusive comparative analyses that have the potential to unveil sequences of significant medical and biological interest and deepen our understanding of sequence exchange between genes, genomes, species, and environments. The project's deliverables will significantly benefit a limited number of research teams currently equipped to handle such comprehensive analyses, thereby expanding the research scope in the field of evolutionary biology."

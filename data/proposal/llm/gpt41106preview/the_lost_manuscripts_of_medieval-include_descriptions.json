        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe LostMa project seeks to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the transmission and evolution of human cultures, with a focus on the preservation and dissemination of written cultural artefacts. This groundbreaking research aims to determine the extent to which the survival or disappearance of manuscripts, texts, and ideas is influenced by factors beyond mere chance. Employing an innovative approach that draws parallels with evolutionary biology and language development, LostMa will explore the processes of innovation, fixation, and extinction as they pertain to textual transmission.\n\nBy examining the replication, alteration, and destruction of texts in manuscript form, this project endeavors to quantify the role of chance versus human agency in cultural transmission and canon formation. This investigation will challenge conventional humanities perspectives by integrating cutting-edge methodologies from artificial intelligence, complexity science, and philological scholarship. Utilizing stochastic models and multi-agent computer simulations, LostMa will emulate the complex dynamics of textual propagation.\n\nA focused case study on chivalric literature within the European tradition will serve as the proving ground for this research. A comprehensive data collection effort will encompass a corpus of 4000 documents across Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages, with an intensive examination of approximately 1000 Old French manuscripts. By employing deep learning techniques, the project will generate empirical data to be juxtaposed with simulation outcomes. This will afford a unique opportunity to measure deviations from randomness, infer non-observable parameters such as text and manuscript loss/survival rates, and ultimately reveal the underlying forces that shape cultural heritage through the ages. LostMa represents a paradigm shift in the study of cultural transmission, poised to provide unprecedented insights into the stewardship of human cultures."

It strives to establish in what measure the transmission (and subsequent preservation or loss) of written artefacts, texts and ideas deviates from pure chance, and, if it deviates, by how much and why it does. It will do so by analysing the way that texts in manuscript form were copied, transformed or destroyed, in a similar way to the evolution of living organisms or of language variants, through process of innovation/mutation, fixation or extinction. As such, the goal of this project is not only to understand the processes behind the transmission of texts, but also to grasp the extent to which humans are the actors of the transmission of their own culture and how much the survival of texts or the constitution of cultural canons are due to chance. If this notion may seem provocative to humanities researchers, evolutionary biologists have long discovered the role of random drift in the survival or extinction of genetic traits and species. To investigate this question, this project will attempt a paradigm-shift in philological methods, by combining artificial intelligence, complexity science and philological expertise. Stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations will be used to emulate the process of textual transmission. A case study will be taken, regarding chivalric literature in European context. Supported by deep learning methods, large-scale data collection will be made on a corpus of 4000 documents in Romance, Germanic and Celtic languages, with a full-text zoom on approx. 1000 Old French manuscripts. Data will provide observable values to be compared to simulation results, in order to measure deviations from chance, make inferences on non observable values such as loss/survival rates of works and manuscripts, and understand the dynamics at work behind the transmission of texts.",

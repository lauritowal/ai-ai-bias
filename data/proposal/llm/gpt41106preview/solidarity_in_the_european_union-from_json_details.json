        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Solidarity in the European Union\" project seeks to articulate a normative model of solidarity tailored to the unique historical and situational context of the European Union (EU). This project, grounded in principles of socioeconomic justice, addresses the critical question of the obligations of social justice that transcend national borders within the EU. The primary aim (EUSOL1) is to develop a theoretical framework of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity that is responsive to the EU's particular challenges. The second aim (EUSOL2) involves applying this model to four central and divisive issues within the EU: free movement of persons, burden-sharing in refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and the process of enlargement and accession.\n\nThis initiative is significant for normative debates on the EU's nature and development, international and global justice, and the interaction between empirical facts and normative political theory. By focusing on solidarity as a core value in European integration, the project has direct relevance to some of the most pressing issues facing the EU today, offering a comprehensive approach to understanding and resolving the tensions inherent in a diverse union of states."

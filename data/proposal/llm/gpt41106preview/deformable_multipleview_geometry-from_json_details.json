        "Abstract:\n\nProject Title: Deformable Multiple-View Geometry and 3D Reconstruction, with Application to Minimally Invasive Surgery\n\nThe proposed project seeks to address a critical gap in the field of 3D Computer Vision, particularly in the subdomain of Shape-from-Motion techniques used to recover 3D shapes from images. Traditional approaches have been largely successful in static, rigid environments; however, they fail to accommodate deformable scenes, which poses a significant challenge for applications like Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) where precise, real-time 3D reconstructions of soft tissue are required. The primary issue is the lack of a robust theoretical framework for Deformable Shape-from-Motion and the absence of practical computational solutions.\n\nOur objectives are twofold: (1) to develop a solid theory for Deformable Shape-from-Motion by generalizing existing theories of Multiple-View Geometry, and (2) to create practical, computational solutions that can be applied in real-world scenarios, particularly in MIS. The research will be conducted along three main lines: theory development, computational implementation, and real-world application.\n\nThe theoretical component will involve the construction of a generalized framework for Deformable Multiple-View Geometry, utilizing mathematical tools such as differentiable projective manifolds. Computationally, the project aims to develop new methods for solving the inverse problems derived from the theoretical work, ensuring that these solutions are computationally feasible and efficient for MIS applications.\n\nThe success of this project will not only make significant contributions to the theoretical underpinnings of 3D Computer Vision in deformable environments but will also provide surgeons with advanced tools for better outcomes in MIS procedures. By bridging the gap between theoretical computer vision and practical surgical application, our work promises to enhance the capabilities of surgical interventions, reduce patient recovery times, and improve overall surgical success rates.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Deformable Multiple-View Geometry and 3D Reconstruction, with Application to Minimally Invasive Surgery\" project seeks to address a significant gap in the field of 3D Computer Vision, particularly in the context of medical technology. Traditional Shape-from-Motion techniques, which recover 3D shapes from images, rely on the assumption of a rigid environment. However, in the dynamic, deformable setting of biological tissues encountered during minimally invasive surgery, these methods falter. The project's aim is to extend the theory of Multiple-View Geometry to deformable environments, overcoming the limitations posed by the lack of a solid theoretical framework and the absence of practical solutions for generating dense 3D shape results in such settings.\n\nThe project's objectives are to develop a rigorous mathematical framework for Deformable Shape-from-Motion, create new computational means for solving inverse problems inherent in this domain, and apply this knowledge to improve the accuracy and safety of Minimally Invasive Surgery. The research will proceed along three lines: theoretical development using advanced mathematical tools such as differentiable projective manifolds; computational implementation that creates practical algorithms capable of dealing with the non-rigidity of biological tissues; and real-world application, demonstrating the utility of the developed theory and computational tools in a surgical setting.\n\nBy generalizing the existing theory of rigid environments to include deformability, Project FLEXABLE endeavors to produce a comprehensive solution that will not only advance the field of 3D Computer Vision but also have a profound impact on medical practices by enhancing surgical precision and patient outcomes. The success of this project could revolutionize the way surgeons interact with 3D data, leading to less invasive procedures, reduced recovery times, and improved surgical results.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Deformable Multiple-View Geometry and 3D Reconstruction, with Application to Minimally Invasive Surgery\n\nThe evolution of 3D computer vision has been instrumental in advancing numerous fields, including medical imaging and surgical applications. The current state-of-the-art primarily handles rigid environments, which is limiting when applied to dynamically changing settings such as those encountered in minimally invasive surgery. This grant proposal outlines an ambitious project aimed at addressing the critical gap in the field of 3D computer vision: the lack of a robust theoretical and practical framework for Deformable Shape-from-Motion in deformable environments.\n\nThe proposed research \"Deformable Multiple-View Geometry and 3D Reconstruction\" seeks to extend the well-established theories of Multiple-View Geometry, which have been successful in rigid settings, to account for non-rigid, deformable objects. The project is divided into three primary lines of research: theoretical development, computational implementation, and real-world application, with a particular focus on the challenges posed by minimally invasive surgery.\n\nOur objectives include the development of a solid theory for Deformable Shape-from-Motion, utilizing mathematical tools such as differentiable projective manifolds to generalize existing rigid theories. We aim to create new computational methods for solving the inverse problems derived from this extended theory. The ultimate goal is to apply the developed framework and computational tools to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of 3D reconstruction in the context of minimally invasive surgery, thereby enhancing surgical outcomes and patient care.\n\nBy overcoming the existing limitations due to the lack of a solid theoretical foundation and practical solutions for deformable environments, this research has the potential to make significant contributions to the field of 3D Computer Vision, with far-reaching implications for the medical community and beyond.\n\nProject FLEXABLE represents a transformative step in the journey towards comprehensive, real-time 3D visualization of deformable anatomical structures, which is a cornerstone for the future of minimally invasive surgical techniques.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Deformable Multiple-View Geometry and 3D Reconstruction, with Application to Minimally Invasive Surgery\" aims to address the critical challenges in the field of 3D Computer Vision, notably the current limitations in Shape-from-Motion techniques when applied to deformable environments. Traditional approaches predicated on Multiple-View Geometry have been successful under the assumption of a rigid environment. However, their applications have been markedly restricted by the lack of a solid theoretical foundation and practical solutions for deformable settings, which are particularly relevant to dynamic fields such as Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS).\n\nThe primary objectives of this proposal are: to develop a comprehensive theory for Deformable Shape-from-Motion; to create robust computational tools that can implement this theory; and to apply these advancements to enhance the precision and safety of MIS procedures. To achieve these aims, our research will unfold along three main lines: theory development, computational implementation, and real-world application.\n\nThe theoretical component will seek to generalize the existing rigid theories to accommodate deformability, using advanced mathematical tools such as differentiable projective manifolds. The computational aspect will focus on devising new means to solve the inverse problems arising from our theoretical models. Finally, our practical application will target the high-stakes environment of MIS, where the ability to accurately reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D images can significantly impact patient outcomes.\n\nBy bridging the gap between rigid and deformable theories in 3D Computer Vision, and harnessing these insights for practical use in surgery, this project promises to not only propel forward the academic understanding of Shape-from-Motion but also to deliver tangible improvements to surgical practices. The end result will be a versatile and theoretically sound methodology with the potential to transform various applications where dynamic 3D reconstruction is vital."

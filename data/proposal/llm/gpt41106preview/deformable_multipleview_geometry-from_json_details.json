        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Deformable Multiple-View Geometry and 3D Reconstruction, with Application to Minimally Invasive Surgery\" aims to address the critical challenges in the field of 3D Computer Vision, notably the current limitations in Shape-from-Motion techniques when applied to deformable environments. Traditional approaches predicated on Multiple-View Geometry have been successful under the assumption of a rigid environment. However, their applications have been markedly restricted by the lack of a solid theoretical foundation and practical solutions for deformable settings, which are particularly relevant to dynamic fields such as Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS).\n\nThe primary objectives of this proposal are: to develop a comprehensive theory for Deformable Shape-from-Motion; to create robust computational tools that can implement this theory; and to apply these advancements to enhance the precision and safety of MIS procedures. To achieve these aims, our research will unfold along three main lines: theory development, computational implementation, and real-world application.\n\nThe theoretical component will seek to generalize the existing rigid theories to accommodate deformability, using advanced mathematical tools such as differentiable projective manifolds. The computational aspect will focus on devising new means to solve the inverse problems arising from our theoretical models. Finally, our practical application will target the high-stakes environment of MIS, where the ability to accurately reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D images can significantly impact patient outcomes.\n\nBy bridging the gap between rigid and deformable theories in 3D Computer Vision, and harnessing these insights for practical use in surgery, this project promises to not only propel forward the academic understanding of Shape-from-Motion but also to deliver tangible improvements to surgical practices. The end result will be a versatile and theoretically sound methodology with the potential to transform various applications where dynamic 3D reconstruction is vital."

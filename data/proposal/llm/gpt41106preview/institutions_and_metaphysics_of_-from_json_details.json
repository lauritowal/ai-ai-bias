        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, \"Institutions and Metaphysics of Cosmology in the Epistemic Networks of Seventeenth-Century Europe,\" undertakes a groundbreaking comparative analysis of the religious and political underpinnings of cosmological debates during a period defined by significant scientific and confessional upheaval. The seventeenth century witnessed the emergence of opposing epistemic cultures, particularly within the Protestant network of northern European universities and the global web of Jesuit colleges. These institutions were pivotal in shaping discussions on heliocentrism, the plurality of worlds, and the nature of celestial matter—controversies that were further intensified by events such as the Roman prohibition of the Copernican system in 1616 and Galileo's condemnation in 1633.\n\nThe project will focus on the intersection of scientific discourse and confessional politics, examining how cosmological debates were influenced by the increasing political and confessional fragmentation of the time. By exploring the formation of competing cosmological cultures along confessional and political lines, the research aims to unravel the complex interrelations between cosmological debates in northern European Protestant and Jesuit networks. It will provide a comparative assessment of early formations and transformations of epistemic webs, seeking to identify parallelisms, contrasts, and intersections in seventeenth-century cosmological discourses.\n\nSignificance lies in addressing the gap in literature concerning the comparative study of the history of knowledge institutions and their metaphysical legitimation. This research will illuminate the political-confessional dimension of early-modern cosmology and the extent to which science was embedded in the struggles for cultural hegemony. The findings are expected to make a vital contribution to our understanding of how institutional and ideological battles shaped the development of early modern science, offering a nuanced perspective on the nature of these epistemic cultures and their lasting impact."

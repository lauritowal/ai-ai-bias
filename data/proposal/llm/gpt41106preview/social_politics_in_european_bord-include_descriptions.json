        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe evolution of welfare and social care systems in Europe is often understood through the lens of state-driven initiatives. However, this project proposes a shift in perspective by highlighting the contributions of local actors, including families and civic associations, in the development of welfare systems within three distinct European border regions: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border areas. This innovative approach spans from the late 19th century to the 1990s and emphasizes the collaborative nature of welfare construction between public and private entities in locales where central state influence was inconsistent. The study aims to illuminate the complex dynamics of inclusion and exclusion within welfare provision, exacerbated by the unique socio-political landscapes of borderlands.\n\nBy employing comparative and transnational methodologies, the project team will dissect the intricate interplay of local welfare structures influenced by various forms of identity and solidarity, such as occupation or religion. The investigation will not only compare the north-western, eastern, and south-eastern borderlands but also track the transference of welfare-related ideas, individuals, and practices across these regions.\n\nThe overarching goal of this research is to deepen our understanding of how local endeavors have shaped broader European welfare systems. Through meticulous local case studies placed in wider contexts, the team will deliver insights with the potential to inform current debates on welfare reform. As Europe grapples with contentious discussions regarding social rights, this historical analysis of local actors' contributions to welfare in borderlands will offer valuable perspectives for contemporary policy discourse and societal reflection."

By focusing on the interactions among local actors and following developments from the late 19th century to the 1990s, this project turns our attention to the co-construction of welfare by public and private actors in highly mixed borderlands, where the reach of central states often fluctuated and a range of local welfare structures, based on national, but also non-national forms of identity/solidarity (e.g., occupation or religion) flourished. The focus on overlapping, and, at times, competing structures of social provision will allow me and my team to examine the interplays between inclusion and exclusion that have long shaped European welfare provision by zeroing in on those contexts where such competition was particularly visible. We will do this by placing intensively researched local studies in comparative and transnational frameworks, examining similarities and differences between north-western, eastern and south-eastern borderlands while tracing the circulation of ideas, people and practices. It is our conviction that the long-range historical study of local actors’ ideas and practices around social welfare in European borderlands has much to tell us about the development of welfare across Europe in general. Our comparative and transnational analysis of the three borderlands will thus enable us to contribute constructively to contemporary societal debates about welfare reform at a time when the social rights (or lack thereof) of populations in Europe are the subject of acrimonious, even violent debate.",

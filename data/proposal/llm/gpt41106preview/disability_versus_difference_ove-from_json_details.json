        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"Disability versus Difference over Development in the Autisms\" seeks to refine the understanding of autism by exploring the heterogeneity within the autism population. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by early-developing conditions, primarily identified through social-communication difficulties and restricted repetitive behaviors. However, the considerable variability in developmental trajectories, treatment responses, and neurobiological underpinnings suggests a spectrum of conditions rather than a singular disorder.\n\nThe primary objectives of the project are to understand autism on a deeper level and to develop individualized facilitation strategies that are impactful. By employing the AUTISMS-3D model, the project aims to differentiate the autism spectrum to explain the variability seen among individuals. This model focuses on three key areas: disability, difference, and development, and it is hypothesized that a major first-level distinction can be made within the autism population between 'disability' and 'difference' in developmental outcomes.\n\nMethodologically, the project will use stratification models based on intellectual functioning, language, and adaptive behavior, coupled with data-driven clustering analyses of large phenotypic and clinical longitudinal datasets. Neurobiological differences will be tested using an array of methods including MRI, fMRI, DTI, EEG, and eye tracking under both static and naturalistic viewing conditions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a refined conceptualization of autism, leading to the advancement of precision medicine tailored to individual profiles within the autism spectrum. By dissecting the heterogeneity at genomic and phenomic scales, this study will provide insights into the subtypes of autism, distinguishing between profound disability and variations in developmental outcomes. The research has a strong intervention context, emphasizing early intervention strategies that are informed by an enhanced neurobiological understanding of individual differences.\n\nThis innovative approach holds the potential to revolutionize the way autism is perceived and treated, moving towards more effective and personalized interventions that acknowledge the diverse experiences of individuals on the autism spectrum."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Disability versus Difference over Development in the Autisms,\" aims to refine our understanding of autism by distinguishing between disability and difference in developmental outcomes within the autism population. Autism, characterized by social-communication difficulties and restricted repetitive behaviors, is highly heterogeneous, with variations at the genome and phenome levels. This heterogeneity complicates diagnosis, intervention, and treatment, necessitating a model that can account for the diverse presentations and trajectories of the condition.\n\nThe project's core objectives are to understand autism more deeply, develop individualized impactful facilitation strategies, and explain variability in developmental paths, treatment responses, and neurobiological mechanisms. To achieve these goals, we will develop and test the AUTISMS-3D model, which focuses on disability, difference, and development. The model aims to explain heterogeneity within the autism population, identifying subtypes such as profound disability and difference in developmental outcomes.\n\nOur methods will include data-driven clustering analyses of large phenotypic and clinical longitudinal datasets, leveraging stratification models based on standardized clinical measures of intellectual functioning, language, and adaptive behavior. We will also use advanced neurobiological assessment methods such as MRI, fMRI, DTI, EEG, and eye-tracking under static and naturalistic viewing conditions to test for neurobiological differences.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research are a major first-level distinction within the autism population between 'disability' and 'difference' in developmental outcomes, a refinement of the understanding and concepts of autism, and an advancement towards precision medicine for autisms. These outcomes will have significant implications for early intervention strategies and the broader approach to autism treatment and support.\n\nBy integrating clinical measures with innovative data analysis techniques and neurobiological assessments, this project will contribute to a paradigm shift in how autism is conceptualized and addressed, moving toward a more individualized approach to care and support for those on the autism spectrum.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Disability versus Difference over Development in the Autisms\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to support the research project \"Disability versus Difference over Development in the Autisms.\" Autism, an early developing condition characterized by social-communication difficulties and restricted repetitive behaviors, represents a spectrum with vast heterogeneity in developmental outcomes. The project aims to understand the nuances of autism and develop individualized facilitation strategies by distinguishing \"disability\" from \"difference\" within the autism population.\n\nThe project will introduce and test the AUTISMS-3D model, a novel framework designed to explain heterogeneity within the autism population, focusing on disability, difference, and development. We will employ data-driven clustering analyses, incorporating stratification models based on intellectual functioning, language, and adaptive behavior. Our data sources include large phenotypic datasets and extensive clinical longitudinal datasets, which will be crucial for identifying subtypes such as profound disability versus difference in developmental outcomes.\n\nThe research team will utilize a range of neurobiological difference assessment methods, including MRI, fMRI, DTI, EEG, and eye tracking under static and naturalistic viewing conditions. These methods will enable us to test neurobiological differences across the autism spectrum.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a major first-level distinction within the autism population between disability and difference in developmental outcomes, a refined understanding of autism, and significant advancements towards precision medicine for autisms. By differentiating autism at the levels of genome and phenome, this research will contribute to the development of targeted early intervention strategies and improve the lives of individuals with autism.\n\nThe impact of this research extends beyond academic advancement; it promises to enhance clinical practices, inform policy-making, and empower communities by providing a deeper understanding of the diverse nature of autism.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project 'Disability versus Difference over Development in the Autisms' aims to revolutionize our understanding of autism by scrutinizing the dichotomy between disability and difference within the autism spectrum. This research seeks to elucidate the heterogeneity in developmental trajectories, response to interventions, and underlying neurobiological mechanisms in individuals with autism. The core objective is to understand autism on a deeper level and to facilitate individualized approaches that significantly impact those affected by the condition.\n\nThe innovative AUTISMS-3D model will be developed and tested to explain the variability within the autism population. The model will focus on three principal aspects: disability, difference, and development. Our approach includes a combination of stratification models based on clinical measures of intellectual functioning, language, and adaptive behavior, alongside data-driven clustering analyses using large phenotypic and big clinical longitudinal datasets. The research will also employ a variety of neurobiological assessment methods, including MRI, fMRI, DTI, EEG, and eye-tracking under both static and naturalistic viewing conditions.\n\nWe anticipate two major outcomes from this study. First, a significant distinction within the autism population between 'disability' and 'difference' in developmental outcomes will be established. Second, the research will refine the understanding of autism and contribute to the advancement of precision medicine tailored to the autisms.\n\nThe anticipated impact of the research is multifold: it will refine the concepts and understanding of autism, enhance early intervention strategies, and lay the groundwork for personalized treatment plans. By integrating data from the genome to the phenome scale, this project represents a pivotal step towards embracing the complexity of autism and providing a foundation for transformative healthcare strategies for individuals with autism.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"Disability versus Difference over Development in the Autisms\" seeks to refine the understanding of autism by exploring the heterogeneity within the autism population. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by early-developing conditions, primarily identified through social-communication difficulties and restricted repetitive behaviors. However, the considerable variability in developmental trajectories, treatment responses, and neurobiological underpinnings suggests a spectrum of conditions rather than a singular disorder.\n\nThe primary objectives of the project are to understand autism on a deeper level and to develop individualized facilitation strategies that are impactful. By employing the AUTISMS-3D model, the project aims to differentiate the autism spectrum to explain the variability seen among individuals. This model focuses on three key areas: disability, difference, and development, and it is hypothesized that a major first-level distinction can be made within the autism population between 'disability' and 'difference' in developmental outcomes.\n\nMethodologically, the project will use stratification models based on intellectual functioning, language, and adaptive behavior, coupled with data-driven clustering analyses of large phenotypic and clinical longitudinal datasets. Neurobiological differences will be tested using an array of methods including MRI, fMRI, DTI, EEG, and eye tracking under both static and naturalistic viewing conditions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a refined conceptualization of autism, leading to the advancement of precision medicine tailored to individual profiles within the autism spectrum. By dissecting the heterogeneity at genomic and phenomic scales, this study will provide insights into the subtypes of autism, distinguishing between profound disability and variations in developmental outcomes. The research has a strong intervention context, emphasizing early intervention strategies that are informed by an enhanced neurobiological understanding of individual differences.\n\nThis innovative approach holds the potential to revolutionize the way autism is perceived and treated, moving towards more effective and personalized interventions that acknowledge the diverse experiences of individuals on the autism spectrum."

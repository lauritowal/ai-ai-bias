        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Deep-sea carbonates under pressure: mechanisms of dissolution and climate feedbacks\n\nThis five-year research initiative aims to unravel the complex mechanisms governing the dissolution of deep-sea calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and its critical role in long-term carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. With the abyssal and hadal realms covering two-thirds of the Earth's surface and harboring vast deposits of CaCO3—formed from the remnants of marine organisms—this project addresses significant knowledge gaps in our understanding of the dissolution processes under the extreme pressures of the deep ocean.\n\nThe proposed study will employ high-pressure reactors, cutting-edge sensors, and advanced CaCO3 imaging techniques to mimic the deep-sea conditions that facilitate CaCO3 dissolution. Bacterial cultures and natural CaCO3 grains will be housed in these reactors to generate precise and continuous data on the biogeochemical processes at play. This approach will also allow for the exploration of the elusive bacterial communities that contribute to CaCO3 transformations.\n\nOur objectives are threefold: to unveil the nature and rate of CaCO3 dissolution under varying environmental factors, to generate high-resolution data that can inform the refinement of a global biogeochemical model, and to deepen our comprehension of the oceans' capability to neutralize CO2 over millennial timescales. This research is poised to contribute significantly to our understanding of ocean acidification impacts, the challenges posed by high-pressure environments, and the potential for mitigating climate change through enhanced marine carbon sinks.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include a series of insights into the driving mechanisms of deep-sea CaCO3 dissolution and a refined model that more accurately represents the ocean's role in global carbon cycles, thereby promoting informed strategies for climate change mitigation."

        "Abstract:\n\nProposal Name: Adolescent Precursors to Psychiatric Disorders – Learning from Analysis of User-Service Engagement\n\nAim: This grant proposal, named Adolescent Precursors to Psychiatric Disorders – Learning from Analysis of User-Service Engagement (APPLAUSE), seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between young people experiencing mental health issues and the various formal and informal mental health services and support structures available to them. The primary aim is to generate evidence that can lead to the development of innovative strategies for earlier access to mental health care.\n\nMethods: The project will collect and analyze data from two distinct cultural contexts, the UK and Brazil, using both standard and innovative life course methods. This will aid in characterizing the complete patterns of service use during adolescence, a critical period for mental health development.\n\nSignificance: Psychiatric disorders are the primary cause of disability among individuals aged 10-24 years, with 70% of adult psychiatric disorders being preceded by mental health problems during adolescent years. Despite this, there is often a delay of more than ten years in accessing care, and the factors impeding access remain largely unknown. By focusing on current access models, individual experiences, and culturally embedded social factors, the project aims to address this complex global problem.\n\nImpact: The expected outcome is the creation of an important international resource offering globally relevant insights into mental health care delivery for young people. This resource will be pivotal in advancing the development of diverse and innovative strategies for improving earlier access to care, thus potentially reducing the long-term impact of psychiatric disorders worldwide.\n\nConclusion: APPLAUSE promises to fill a significant gap in the current understanding of adolescent mental health service engagement and pave the way for transformative changes in how mental health care is delivered to young people globally."

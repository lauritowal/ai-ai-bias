        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Chromatin Fiber and Remodeling Factor Structural Studies\n\nThe proposed research seeks to unravel the complex hierarchical structure of chromatin and the dynamic mechanisms of chromatin remodeling, which are central to understanding DNA compaction and access. Chromatin's role in encoding epigenetic information and its dependence on remodeling factors like ISW1a for proper function underscores the significance of such studies for medical science. Building on previous work that includes the high-resolution structure of the nucleosome core particle and the X-ray structure of the tetranucleosome, the project aims to overcome challenges related to structural polymorphism and crystal disorder, informed by new evidence on in vivo nucleosome spacing.\n\nThe research will employ a multifaceted approach, including cryo-electron microscopy to study the chromatin fiber and crystallographic analysis of a tetranucleosome with linker histone, aiming to illuminate the structure of chromatin fiber. Additionally, the project will perform functional assays using recombinant ISW1a and interaction studies to dissect the mechanism for nucleosome spacing by chromatin remodeling factors. The expected outcomes include the development of cryo-EM and X-ray structures incorporating dinucleosomes and a deeper understanding of the ATPase domain's interaction with nucleosome substrates.\n\nThe expected impacts of this research are profound, offering advances in the understanding of chromatin structure, providing new insights into the chromatin remodeling processes, and paving the way for contributions to medical developments, specifically in the areas of epigenetics and gene regulation. The methodologies to be utilized are on the cutting edge of structural biology, including the use of cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, supported by advanced computing for data analysis. Through the elucidation of these complex biological structures and interactions, the project will address fundamental questions in chromatin biology and foster potential therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic disorders.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Chromatin Fiber and Remodeling Factor Structural Studies\" project aims to elucidate the complex hierarchical structure of chromatin and the molecular mechanisms governing its remodeling, which are vital for understanding DNA compaction and access. This research holds significant potential for medical advancements by decoding the epigenetic information embedded within chromatin modifications. Building on previous accomplishments, including the high-resolution structure of the nucleosome core particle and the X-ray structure of the tetranucleosome, this project seeks to address the challenges of structural polymorphism and crystal disorder.\n\nThe project is divided into two main parts: Part A will focus on employing cryo-electron microscopy to study the chromatin fiber and conduct a crystallographic study of the tetranucleosome with linker histone. Part B will expand on these techniques to incorporate dinucleosomes into cryo-EM and X-ray structures. Functional assays using the recombinant chromatin remodeling factor ISW1a will provide insights into the interaction between the ATPase domain and nucleosome substrates. The recent discovery of a structurally based mechanism for nucleosome spacing by ISW1a underscores the feasibility and potential impact of this research.\n\nThe methodologies combine state-of-the-art high-resolution structure analysis, cryo-electron microscopy, and functional assays to overcome existing challenges and leverage new evidence on in vivo nucleosome spacing. The use of recombinant ISW1a for interaction studies will further refine our understanding of chromatin dynamics.\n\nThe expected impacts of this project include a deeper comprehension of the chromatin structure, novel insights into chromatin remodeling processes, and significant contributions to the field of medicine. This proposal requests funding to support the acquisition of cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography data and the development of robust functional assays, thereby enabling a comprehensive investigation of these essential biological phenomena.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Chromatin Fiber and Remodeling Factor Structural Studies\n\nThe proposed project seeks to elucidate the hierarchical structure of chromatin and the detailed mechanisms by which chromatin remodeling factors such as ISW1a influence nucleosome spacing and access. Our recent success in determining the high-resolution structure of the nucleosome core particle and the X-ray structure of the tetranucleosome informs our in-depth exploration of chromatin organization and its functional implications in cellular processes and medical advancements.\n\nThis study will leverage cutting-edge methodologies, including cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, to achieve several primary objectives. Firstly, we aim to determine the three-dimensional structure of the chromatin fiber, particularly focusing on the role of the linker histone in the formation of a tetranucleosome. Secondly, we plan to develop detailed cryo-EM and X-ray structures that incorporate dinucleosomes, furthering our understanding of the nucleosome's structural polymorphism and crystal disorder challenges.\n\nAdditionally, through functional assays using recombinant ISW1a and interaction studies of its ATPase domain with nucleosome substrates, we will delineate the structurally based mechanisms governing nucleosome spacing. This will build upon our recent findings, which provided the first mechanistic insight into nucleosome organization by a chromatin remodeling factor.\n\nThe proposed research is poised to offer pivotal contributions to the field of epigenetics, particularly by advancing our comprehension of chromatin's structural and functional dynamics. The insights gained may pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions targeting chromatin remodeling pathways, with far-reaching impacts on the treatment of diseases linked to epigenetic dysregulation. With access to state-of-the-art cryo-electron microscopes and X-ray crystallography equipment, along with high-quality materials such as recombinant ISW1a, this project promises to resolve longstanding questions surrounding the intricate architecture of chromatin fiber and its remodeling.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Chromatin Fiber and Remodeling Factor Structural Studies\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive research project aimed at elucidating the hierarchical structure of chromatin and the intricate mechanisms of chromatin remodeling. Chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells, is essential for compacting DNA and governing access for transcription, replication, and repair. Epigenetic information is encoded through chromatin modifications, which are dependent on chromatin remodeling processes.\n\nPrevious work has yielded high-resolution structures of the nucleosome core particle and the X-ray structure of the tetranucleosome, contributing valuable insights into the organization of DNA within chromatin. Despite these advancements, challenges such as structural polymorphism and crystal disorder hinder progress. New evidence indicating in vivo spacing of nucleosomes underscores the need for further investigation.\n\nOur proposed study approaches include a cryo-electron microscopy study of the chromatin fiber and a crystallographic study of the tetranucleosome with linker histone. We also plan to develop cryo-EM and X-ray structures incorporating dinucleosomes and to perform functional assays using recombinant ISW1a, a chromatin remodeling factor that has recently been implicated in nucleosome spacing. Interaction studies of the ATPase domain of ISW1a with nucleosome substrates will provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of chromatin remodeling.\n\nThe objectives of our research are twofold: Part A will apply new findings to cryo-EM and crystallographic studies of chromatin fiber and tetranucleosome; Part B seeks to obtain cryo-EM and X-ray structures of dinucleosomes and study the interaction of ISW1a with nucleosome substrates. Through these methodologies, this study aims to advance our understanding of chromatin structure and remodeling processes, ultimately contributing to medical developments.\n\nThe expected impacts of this research include new insights into the chromatin structure, elucidation of remodeling mechanisms, and significant contributions to the fields of molecular biology and medicine. The grant will support the use of cutting-edge equipment such as cryo-electron microscopes and X-ray crystallography, and materials including recombinant ISW1a and nucleosome substrates."

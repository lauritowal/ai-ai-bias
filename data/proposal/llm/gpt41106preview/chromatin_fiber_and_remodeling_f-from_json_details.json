        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Chromatin Fiber and Remodeling Factor Structural Studies\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive research project aimed at elucidating the hierarchical structure of chromatin and the intricate mechanisms of chromatin remodeling. Chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cells, is essential for compacting DNA and governing access for transcription, replication, and repair. Epigenetic information is encoded through chromatin modifications, which are dependent on chromatin remodeling processes.\n\nPrevious work has yielded high-resolution structures of the nucleosome core particle and the X-ray structure of the tetranucleosome, contributing valuable insights into the organization of DNA within chromatin. Despite these advancements, challenges such as structural polymorphism and crystal disorder hinder progress. New evidence indicating in vivo spacing of nucleosomes underscores the need for further investigation.\n\nOur proposed study approaches include a cryo-electron microscopy study of the chromatin fiber and a crystallographic study of the tetranucleosome with linker histone. We also plan to develop cryo-EM and X-ray structures incorporating dinucleosomes and to perform functional assays using recombinant ISW1a, a chromatin remodeling factor that has recently been implicated in nucleosome spacing. Interaction studies of the ATPase domain of ISW1a with nucleosome substrates will provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of chromatin remodeling.\n\nThe objectives of our research are twofold: Part A will apply new findings to cryo-EM and crystallographic studies of chromatin fiber and tetranucleosome; Part B seeks to obtain cryo-EM and X-ray structures of dinucleosomes and study the interaction of ISW1a with nucleosome substrates. Through these methodologies, this study aims to advance our understanding of chromatin structure and remodeling processes, ultimately contributing to medical developments.\n\nThe expected impacts of this research include new insights into the chromatin structure, elucidation of remodeling mechanisms, and significant contributions to the fields of molecular biology and medicine. The grant will support the use of cutting-edge equipment such as cryo-electron microscopes and X-ray crystallography, and materials including recombinant ISW1a and nucleosome substrates."

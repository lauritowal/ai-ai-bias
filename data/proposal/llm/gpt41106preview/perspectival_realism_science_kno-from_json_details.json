        "Abstract:\n\nThe grant proposal titled \"Perspectival Realism: Science, Knowledge, and Truth from a Human Vantage Point\" seeks to develop a cutting-edge philosophical framework, perspectival realism, which reconciles the subjectivity inherent in scientific inquiry with the objective pursuit of truth. This highly interdisciplinary project bridges the gap between philosophy of science, scientific practice, history of science, and history of philosophy, with a focus on scientific perspectivism across the physical sciences, life sciences, and social sciences.\n\nThe research aims to resolve pressing questions such as whether scientific knowledge can be both perspectival and true, and if perspectivism is compatible with realism. The project's innovative methodology will unfold through five sub-projects, engaging collaborators from diverse disciplines including physicists, historians of science and philosophy, and philosophers of science.\n\nThe goals of the proposal include:\n1. Conducting a systematic investigation into how contemporary physicists handle perspectival modelling, exploring both non-perspectival methods in particle physics and the integration of different data sets in observational cosmology.\n2. Examining historical case studies to understand the extent of scientific controversies arising from perspectival modelling, with an emphasis on measurement and experimental techniques.\n3. Re-assessing the historical origins of perspectivism during the Enlightenment period, particularly focusing on Kant's 'Copernican Revolution'.\n4. Elaborating on a metaphysical framework that supports perspectival realism, answering whether perspectivism can coexist with an objective view of realism.\n\nThe outcome of this research is an innovative philosophical position that advances debates on pluralism, unification, and realism in scientific research. By fostering a scientifically and historically informed understanding of perspectival realism, this project has the potential to reframe our conception of scientific knowledge and truth from a human vantage point.\n\n(Word count: 273)"

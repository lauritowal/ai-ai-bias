        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project \"Beyond Turing: Reaction-diffusion mechanisms of embryonic self-organization\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of biological pattern formation by transcending the limitations of current Turing models. Despite Turing's hypothesis framing reaction-diffusion as a driver of self-organization, existing models suffer from oversimplification, fragility, and an inability to account for non-repetitive patterns observed in vivo. Furthermore, these models fail to scale with tissue size, which is critical for accurate representation of embryonic development.\n\nOur multi-disciplinary team, with expertise spanning theoretical physics, experimental embryology, and computational biology, seeks to address these gaps by developing innovative computational tools to explore reaction-diffusion systems with a level of complexity and biological realism never before achieved. We will identify robust self-organizing mechanisms, discover paradigms for non-repetitive pattern formation, and elucidate scaling mechanisms that are congruent with tissue size changes during development.\n\nThe approach will involve challenging existing models with high-resolution quantitative data, both from published datasets and collaborations with experimentalists. Pilot data indicates the potential for new paradigms that better reflect the molecular intricacies of in vivo systems. Our collaborative efforts will not only create more resilient and reproducible models but also provide insights into embryonic self-organization that can have profound implications for developmental biology and regenerative medicine.\n\nThis proposal promises to deliver unprecedented advancements in the field, offering a more profound understanding of the fundamental processes that guide embryonic development. By bridging the gap between theoretical models and biological reality, \"Beyond Turing\" will set a new standard for the study of self-organization and pattern formation in complex biological systems."

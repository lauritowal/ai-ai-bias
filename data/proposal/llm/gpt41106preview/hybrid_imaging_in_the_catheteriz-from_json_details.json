        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Hybrid Imaging in the Catheterization Room,\" aims to extend the application of the patented IXSI c-arm scanner, hitherto used for oncological purposes, into the realm of interventional cardiology. Building on the foundation established by the ERC Consolidator Grant (ERC CoG), this project seeks funding through the ERC Proof of Concept grant to evaluate the potential of IXSI in improving the identification of culprit vessels and assessing treatment outcomes during cardiac interventions.\n\nThe objectives of the project are fourfold: firstly, to assess the benefits and market share of IXSI for cardiology patient groups and treatments; secondly, to evaluate its performance specifically for cardiology using custom-made testing devices; thirdly, to investigate the cost-effectiveness of IXSI for cardiology following necessary hardware modifications; and finally, to develop a comprehensive business case promoting the adoption of IXSI in cardiac interventions.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include accelerated clinical implementation of IXSI in cardiac interventions, which will benefit from the technology's ability to provide enhanced imaging during procedures. With nearly one million percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed annually in the United States alone, the commercial potential for IXSI is substantial. This initiative promises not only to improve patient care but also to capture a significant share of the market, given its massive application field.\n\nThe project aligns with the ERC's mission to bridge the gap between pioneering research and marketable innovation, representing a strategic advancement in medical imaging technology with a high commercial incentive and the potential for significant impact on clinical practices in interventional cardiology."

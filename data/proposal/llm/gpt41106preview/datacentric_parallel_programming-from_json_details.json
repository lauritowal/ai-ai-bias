        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Data-centric Parallel Programming\"\n\nLarge-scale heterogeneous parallel computers are at the forefront of addressing some of the most computationally demanding problems in modern science and technology, such as drug design, weather prediction, and big data analytics. These systems range from quad-core laptops to million-core supercomputers, all characterized by heterogeneous parallel processors that present a significant challenge: efficiently mapping data to the target memory system. As the degree of parallelism increases, the cost of data access grows, making the optimization of data layout paramount.\n\nThe current control-centric programming model has limitations, as it often overlooks the importance of data access patterns. To overcome these limitations, our proposal, \"Data-centric Parallel Programming,\" introduces a holistic approach that pivots to a data-centric program formulation. This new paradigm represents programs as collections of values, termed \"memlets,\" which the compiler and runtime system actively manage, mapping them as first-class objects. This innovative system integrates both static and dynamic scheduling of memlets, ensuring efficient use of complex heterogeneous target architectures.\n\nThe proposed solution is not merely theoretical; it will be demonstrated across a variety of applications, including scientific computing, data analytics, and graph processing. By adopting a data-centric approach, we aim to circumvent the looming scaling wall that threatens to stall advancements in computational capabilities. Our holistic compiler and runtime system will set a new state of the art in parallel computing, allowing for unprecedented technological progress in a multitude of fields dependent on high-performance computing.\n\nThe significance of this project is clear: without a shift to data-centric parallel programming, we risk hitting a bottleneck in our ability to solve large-scale problems efficiently. Our proposed system seeks to ensure that the next generation of heterogeneous parallel computers will be fully exploitable, fostering continual technological advancement and innovation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe rise of large-scale heterogeneous parallel computers, from quad-core laptops to million-core supercomputers, has ushered in a new era of challenges for the programming community. Our proposal, \"Data-centric Parallel Programming,\" addresses the critical difficulty in efficiently mapping data to the diverse memory systems of these architectures. As computational problems become increasingly parallel in nature, applications such as drug design, weather prediction, and big data analytics are hitting a scaling wall due to the growing cost of data access, which scales with the amount of parallelism.\n\nCurrent programming paradigms adopt a control-centric model that largely ignores the critical aspect of data layout. This approach is proving to be unsuitable for the current trend of heterogeneous parallel processors, where data access and mapping significantly impact performance. Our proposed solution is a shift towards a data-centric program formulation, which represents programs as collections of values, termed \"memlets.\" These memlets are treated as first-class objects by a holistic compiler and runtime system that intelligently maps them across various architectures. This shift from a control-centric to a data-centric approach is central to overcoming the inefficiencies of previous models.\n\nThe proposed system will combine both static and dynamic scheduling of memlets to handle the complexities of heterogeneous target architectures effectively. The system aims to advance the state of the art in parallel computing by demonstrating its capability across a range of applications, including scientific computing, data analytics, and graph processing. Without this data-centric solution, the computational capabilities of future systems will be severely limited, hindering progress in crucial technological fields. Our project is therefore essential to ensure continued scaling and advancement in parallel computing performance.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe advent of large-scale heterogeneous parallel computers has ushered in an era where computationally demanding problems, such as drug design, weather prediction, and big data analytics, can be tackled more effectively than ever before. However, the challenge remains in programming these systems efficiently, as the cost of data access grows with the amount of parallelism, and current abstractions largely ignore data access patterns. The proposal \"Data-centric Parallel Programming\" seeks to address this gap by introducing a data-centric approach to program formulation.\n\nOur project focuses on the development of novel programming methodologies that consider data layout optimizations as crucial to the success of parallel computing on a wide range of computing platforms, from quad-core laptops to million-core supercomputers. We propose to shift away from the traditional control-centric model towards a holistic compiler and runtime system that utilizes collections of values, termed memlets, as the primary program representation.\n\nThe proposed system will handle the mapping of memlets as first-class objects, thus allowing for both static and dynamic scheduling to efficiently address the complex heterogeneous target architectures. This approach is expected to significantly advance the state of the art in parallel computing by facilitating the efficient exploitation of varying computational architectures, ultimately avoiding the scaling wall that threatens to limit future computational capabilities.\n\nOur proposed solution will be demonstrated through applications in scientific computing, data analytics, and graph processing. By adopting a data-centric parallel programming model, we aim to lay the groundwork for technological advancements that are essential for progressing in fields that rely heavily on the power of parallel computing. The consequence of not addressing this challenge is a potential stagnation in computational growth, as traditional methods do not scale effectively with the architectural trends in parallel processors. Thus, our project stands to make a significant impact in the way computationally intensive problems are approached and solved.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe advent of large-scale heterogeneous parallel computers has ushered in a new era of scientific possibilities in fields ranging from drug design to weather prediction and big data analytics. However, the programming of these complex systems poses a significant challenge: efficiently mapping data to the target memory system for a range of computing platforms, from quad-core laptops to million-core supercomputers. With data access costs rising in tandem with the degree of parallelism, the need for optimization in data layout is more crucial than ever. The current control-centric programming model falls short in addressing this need, leading to a potential \"scaling wall\" that could severely limit future computational capabilities.\n\nOur proposal, titled \"Data-centric Parallel Programming,\" aims to revolutionize the programming paradigm for parallel computing by introducing a data-centric approach to program formulation. We propose representing programs as collections of values, termed \"memlets,\" which are treated as first-class objects by a holistic compiler and runtime system. This system is designed to handle complex heterogeneous target architectures through a unique blend of static and dynamic scheduling of memlets. By rethinking data mapping and access, our approach addresses the notorious difficulty of data mapping and aims to break through the scaling wall that current abstractions cannot circumvent.\n\nThe system's efficacy will be demonstrated through applications in scientific computing, data analytics, and graph processing. By advancing the state of the art in parallel computing, this data-centric model promises to unlock a new level of performance and efficiency, ensuring that our computational abilities continue to grow in line with technological advancements. The outcome of this project has the potential to provide a fundamental shift in how large-scale computational problems are approached, ultimately impacting a wide range of computationally intensive applications."

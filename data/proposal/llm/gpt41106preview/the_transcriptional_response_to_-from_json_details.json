        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"The Transcriptional Response to Oxidative Stress\" aims to dissect the complex biological response of cells to oxidative stress, a factor implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders and cancer. Oxidative stress leads to rapid and transient global repression of transcription, a process not fully understood. Our hypothesis posits that the transcriptional response to oxidative stress involves intricate regulation of transcription elongation and termination, connected to post-translational modifications of RNA polymerase II. This proposal will pursue objectives to investigate the transcriptome-wide oxidative stress response in human cells, study the response following physiological induction in mice, and elucidate the mechanisms by which transcriptional response factors influence transcription-associated genome instability and neuronal cell identity.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we will employ state-of-the-art sequencing techniques, time-resolved proteomics, and a novel screening approach. The research will provide new knowledge about the transcriptional response to oxidative stress and the stress-specific mechanisms that govern transcriptional repression at most genes. Understanding how RNA polymerase II can stop and restart transcription in response to oxidative stress is crucial for comprehending the cellular processes that contribute to the development of disease.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to reveal targets for therapeutic intervention in diseases where oxidative stress plays a key role. By advancing our understanding of the cellular response to environmental stress, this project has the potential to make a substantial impact on the treatment and management of neurological disorders and cancer. \n\nKeywords: Oxidative stress, transcription, RNA polymerase II, sequencing, proteomics, neurological disorders, cancer."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"A Modular Sensing and Imaging Toolkit for the Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer Employing Lab-on-the-Chip Methodologies\" aims to revolutionize the early detection and non-invasive monitoring of prostate cancer (PCa). This proof-of-concept project addresses the limitations of current diagnostic methods, such as ELISA, which struggles with detection limits below 1 ng/ml for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Leveraging advancements from the ERC Consolidator Grant-funded O2Sense project, this initiative will focus on the development of diagnostic sensor prototypes that combine electrochemical and optical biosensing techniques.\n\nThe proposed modular toolkit targets the early diagnosis of PCa in ageing men worldwide, with the potential to detect circulating cancerous cells and low levels of PSMA in blood up to five years before symptoms appear. Utilizing lab-on-the-chip technology, the project will create real-time application sensors with improved sensitivity. The project's goals include the development of fast and reliable PCa detection methods and the ability to non-invasively monitor PCa post-diagnosis.\n\nThe approach includes interfacing novel sensors with actuators on a lab-on-the-chip platform, leading to the development of technologies such as peptides-functionalised graphene substrates and field-effect transistors. These nanotechnologies will be employed to detect a panel of PCa biomarkers, with sensor outputs providing combined electrochemical and fluorescence emission signals. The project will emphasize target identification and validation, bioassay development, and stringent quality control.\n\nBy achieving these objectives, the Tools-To-Sense project will not only deliver a modular toolkit for early PCa diagnosis but also contribute significantly to the field of molecular imaging and personalized medicine. The anticipated advancements promise to offer an innovative solution for the healthcare sector, potentially improving outcomes for millions of men at risk for prostate cancer."

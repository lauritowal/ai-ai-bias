        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"A modular sensing and imaging toolkit for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer employing lab-on-the-chip methodologies\" (Tools-To-Sense) aims to revolutionize the early detection of prostate cancer (PCa) by overcoming the current limitations of standard ELISA screening techniques, which struggle with detection limits below 1 ng/ml for prostate-specific antigen (PSA). This proof-of-concept project focuses on the development of diagnostic sensor prototypes that utilize a combination of electrochemical and optical biosensing technologies integrated into lab-on-the-chip platforms. \n\nTools-To-Sense will leverage advancements from the ERC Consolidator Grant O2Sense, particularly in the field of tailored chemical sensors for molecular imaging of PCa. The proposed sensors aim to detect circulating PCa cells at concentrations that are currently undetectable, allowing for the diagnosis of PCa up to five years before the onset of symptoms. This will significantly benefit the target population of ageing men worldwide through early diagnosis and non-invasive monitoring post-diagnosis.\n\nThe project's approach includes the identification and validation of PCa biomarkers, development of bioassays for these targets, and rigorous quality control to ensure reliability. Novel nanotechnology techniques will be employed, such as peptides-functionalised graphene substrates and field-effect transistors, to develop sensors capable of providing real-time applications with higher sensitivity. These sensors will generate a physical signal consisting of a combined electrochemical and fluorescence emission, offering an innovative method for molecular imaging and early PCa detection.\n\nThe anticipated advancements from Tools-To-Sense include the ability to detect low levels of PSMA in blood and other biomarkers associated with PCa, facilitating a significant leap forward in PCa diagnostics and patient care. This project promises to create a new standard in PCa screening, ultimately improving early diagnosis and monitoring, with potential applications extending to other forms of cancer.",
        "Abstract:\n\nProstate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among aging men worldwide, with early detection being critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Current screening methods, such as ELISA, are limited by their inability to detect low concentrations of prostate-specific antigens (PSA) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), often missing the early, treatable stages of the disease. The proposed project, \"A Modular Sensing and Imaging Toolkit for the Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer Employing Lab-on-the-Chip Methodologies,\" aims to overcome these limitations by developing a proof-of-concept diagnostic toolkit that integrates cutting-edge biosensor technologies for rapid and sensitive detection of circulating PCa cells.\n\nOur project will leverage advancements from the ERC Consolidator Grant O2Sense, focusing on the design of diagnostic sensor prototypes using peptides-functionalised graphene substrates and field-effect transistors. These sensors will be capable of real-time application, detecting a panel of PCa biomarkers with significantly higher sensitivity than current methods. The toolkit will provide a combined electrochemical and fluorescence emission signal, offering a dual-detection approach for enhanced accuracy.\n\nThe project's goals include the development of fast and reliable PCa detection methods, enabling early diagnosis and non-invasive monitoring of PCa post-diagnosis. We aim to detect low levels of PSMA in blood up to five years before symptoms, employing lab-on-the-chip methodologies to interface sensors with actuators for real-time applications.\n\nOur interdisciplinary team will conduct target identification and validation, bioassay development, and rigorous quality control to ensure the toolkit's efficacy and reliability. The anticipated outcome is a modular, real-time application for early PCa diagnosis, significantly impacting patient survival rates and quality of life. This advancement holds promise for setting a new standard in PCa screening and monitoring.",

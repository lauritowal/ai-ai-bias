        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Verified Physics-Aware Machine Learning to Transform Non-Linear Power System Stability and Optimization\n\nThe proposed project aims to revolutionize the electricity sector's approach to stability and optimization amidst the intensifying challenge of integrating renewable energy sources and managing increased demand. Our objective is to develop physics-aware verifiable neural networks accompanied by a training procedure that guarantees accuracy, targeting the current limitations of computational intractability and prohibitive costs associated with existing methods.\n\nThe innovative core of our proposal lies in the creation of data-driven methodologies that can handle complexity, deliver a performance 250-1000 times faster than traditional approaches, and offer higher accuracy. By exploiting the physical properties of power systems, we propose verifiable neural networks that are not black-box in nature, thus enhancing reliability in safety-critical systems.\n\nOur methods will ensure that the neural network training procedure is designed with guarantees, providing a provable upper bound on the prediction error across the entire input space. This addresses the limitations of black-box models in critical applications by allowing for physics-aware predictions that can be verified for accuracy. The proposed solution also simplifies the optimization problem by reducing it to a tractable mixed-integer linear program, increasing computation speed and tractability.\n\nThe impact of our project is expected to be transformative, unifying the framework for dynamics and optimization, accurately capturing feasible regions, eliminating the need for approximations, and significantly reducing redispatching costs, with potential annual savings amounting to billions of euros. The proposed methods and solutions have the potential to extend beyond power systems, applicable to a wide range of physical safety-critical systems, which underscores the broad relevance and significance of this research.\n\nThis project promises a paradigm shift in how we handle non-linear constraints and optimization in power systems, laying the groundwork for a more sustainable and economically viable future in energy management."

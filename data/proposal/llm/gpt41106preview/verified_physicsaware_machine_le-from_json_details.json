        "Abstract:\n\nIn response to the urgent need for global warming measures, the proposed project, \"Verified physics-aware machine learning to transform non-linear power system stability and optimization,\" aims to revolutionize the electricity sector by enhancing system stability amidst the integration of renewable energy sources and the surge in electricity demand. Current approaches reach computational intractability and impose extremely high costs; however, data-driven methodologies have demonstrated handling complexity with impressive performance, offering high accuracy and a computational speed 250-1000 times faster than traditional methods.\n\nOur innovative approach utilizes physics-aware verifiable neural networks, a groundbreaking technology poised to provide by-design guarantees of prediction accuracy across the entire input space. The proposed training procedure will ensure a provable upper bound on prediction errors, transforming the handling of non-linear constraints and reducing complex optimization problems to tractable mixed-integer linear programs. This not only increases computation speed and tractability but also offers a non-black box approach that exploits physical properties – a critical feature for safety-critical systems.\n\nThe impact on power systems will be profound, unifying dynamics and optimization within a single framework, accurately capturing feasible regions, removing costly approximations, and eliminating redispatching costs – leading to annual savings of billions of euros. Furthermore, the applications of this research extend beyond power systems, encompassing a wide range of physical safety-critical systems.\n\nThis project promises a paradigm shift in how we manage and optimize power systems for a sustainable and stable energy future, contributing significantly to CO2 emission reduction efforts and addressing the challenges posed by the rapid increase in electricity demand.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Verified physics-aware machine learning to transform non-linear power system stability and optimization,\" seeks to revolutionize the electricity sector by addressing the critical challenge of maintaining system stability amidst the integration of renewable energy sources and rising electricity demand. The project's ultimate objective is to develop and deploy physics-aware verifiable neural networks, which are capable of handling the complexity of power system dynamics with higher accuracy and at speeds exponentially faster than traditional methods—ranging from 250 to 1000 times quicker.\n\nCurrent approaches to power system stability and optimization are computationally intractable and extremely costly, rendering them insufficient for the disruptive changes required for global warming measures, such as replacing bulk generation units with renewable energy sources. The proposed solution leverages recent advancements in data-driven methods, specifically the development of physics-aware verifiable neural networks that can predict with a provable upper bound of error across the entire input space. This innovation allows for handling non-linear constraints and significantly simplifies the optimization problem by reducing it to a tractable mixed-integer linear program, thereby enhancing computation speed and tractability.\n\nThe impact of this project is anticipated to be far-reaching, offering a unified framework for dynamics and optimization that accurately captures the feasible region, eliminates approximations, and removes the need for costly redispatching, potentially saving billions of euros annually. Moreover, the applications of this research extend beyond power systems to a wide range of physical safety-critical systems, thereby contributing to a more sustainable and reliable future.\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to support the development and implementation of this trailblazing approach, promising significant advancements in power system stability and optimization while contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions and the combat against global warming.",

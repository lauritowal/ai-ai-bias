        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"Towards a decentred history of the Middle East: Transborder spaces, circulations, frontier effects, and state formation, 1920-1946,\" aims to reconstruct the socio-historical narrative of the Middle East’s state formation during the interwar period. This research will concentrate on the territories of Turkey, Iraq, and Syria, scrutinizing the period between 1920 and 1946—a transformative era following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. \n\nThe primary objectives are to conduct a socio-historical analysis of state violence in Middle East borderlands, to examine the role of border populations in the construction of historical narratives, to study the frontier effects on subjectivity, space, and time, and to offer a historical perspective on the current conflicts in Syria and Iraq. By focusing on transborder phenomena and the circulation of people, goods, and ideas, this project challenges the centralized narratives of state formation and offers a decentred view that encompasses the perspectives and agency of borderland populations.\n\nThe research will deploy a multi-level approach, examining macro, meso, and micro historical developments. Methodologically, it will involve the analysis of diverse historical documents, including diplomatic, administrative, and military records, missionary documents, and newspapers. These sources will illuminate the co-production of borders between states and societies and the 'histoire-problème' of borderlands. The project's epistemological underpinnings consider borderlands as dynamic spaces where the interactions between local actors and state representatives shape the historical and social landscape.\n\nBy providing a holistic and finely-grained understanding of territorial state formation in the post-First World War Middle East, this research will not only contribute to historical knowledge but also offer valuable insight for contemporary conflict resolution and policy-making in the region.\n\nKeywords: Middle East history, borderlands, state formation, transborder spaces, interwar period, socio-historical analysis."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Local Control of Macroscopic Properties in Isolated Many-body Quantum Systems (LoCoMacro)\n\nThe proposed project, LoCoMacro, seeks to revolutionize our understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics in many-body quantum systems by exploring the capacity to control macroscopic properties through localized interventions. Historically, research has predominantly focused on equilibrium properties of systems typically coupled to an environment. However, recent experimental breakthroughs with ultra-cold, trapped atoms have shifted attention towards the nonequilibrium dynamics in almost isolated systems. These advancements have unveiled phenomena such as a new kind of relaxation not caused by dissipation, challenging conventional wisdom.\n\nThis project aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind the relaxation of inhomogeneous systems, the emergence of nonequilibrium steady states, and the global effects of localized perturbations on stationary properties. LoCoMacro will confront these questions by combining advanced analytic techniques and state-of-the-art numerical simulations to achieve precise control over macroscopic nonequilibrium properties by acting locally. The project will investigate integrable models to obtain exact results for correlation functions and entanglement measures, which are crucial for understanding many-body localization and thermalization.\n\nLoCoMacro bridges the gap between several pivotal topics, such as thermalization in homogeneous systems and many-body localization in disordered ones, providing a comprehensive approach to nonequilibrium dynamics. The unique focus on localized perturbations serves as a novel pathway to control and predict the behavior of complex quantum systems.\n\nThe outcomes of LoCoMacro are expected to have profound implications for the field, opening new avenues for research in quantum control, information processing, and material sciences. The insights gained could lead to the development of innovative technologies based on the principles of quantum mechanics, with potential applications in quantum computing and beyond."

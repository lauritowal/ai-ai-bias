        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Constraints and Opportunities for Horizontal Gene Transfer in Bacterial Evolution\n\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a pivotal mechanism in bacterial evolution, endowing populations with new traits and capabilities while simultaneously posing the risk of incorporating deleterious genetic material. The proposed research seeks to elucidate the selective forces that govern the success or failure of HGT events, which is critical for a comprehensive understanding of microbial evolution and for addressing the global challenge posed by pathogenic bacteria.\n\nDespite its fundamental role, current models of HGT lack precision in accounting for the variance in outcomes of these events. Our project introduces a groundbreaking approach that incorporates genomic context to decipher the selective drivers of HGT. We plan to develop a novel genetic technology that enables high-throughput fitness measurements of HGT events. By doing so, we aim to identify and quantify constraints that determine HGT success, including the intrinsic effects of transferred DNA and its integration into various genomic regions.\n\nOur methodology will encompass a detailed analysis of the fitness effects associated with genetic transfers mediated by plasmids (Objective 1), as well as those resulting from DNA integration into different chromosomal regions (Objective 2). Furthermore, we will reconstruct HGT's role in the evolution of a significant human pathogen (Objective 3), thereby providing invaluable insights into the adaptive processes of bacteria.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the selective forces driving HGT. This will significantly advance the field of evolutionary microbiology and potentially inform the development of novel strategies to combat bacterial pathogens. Through this innovative research, we aim to shed light on the complex interplay between bacterial genomes and the environment, ultimately contributing to our ability to predict and influence bacterial evolutionary trajectories."

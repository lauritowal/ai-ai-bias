        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Repair of Junctional Atrioventricular Conduction and Impulse Formation,\" aims to address the limitations of current biological pacemakers by developing a stem cell-based therapy capable of restoring atrioventricular (AV) conduction and impulse formation. With approximately 300,000 pacemaker implantations annually in Europe and a complication rate of 5%, resulting in costs upward of 8 billion Euros, there is a critical need for innovative solutions. Current biological pacemakers serve only about 20% of patients due to hardware-related complications, indicating a significant unmet need for the majority of patients with pacemaker indications.\n\nThe core objective of this project is to create a therapy that leverages human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate AV nodal cells capable of restoring intrinsic cardiac rhythm. This novel approach involves extensive in vitro testing of hiPSC-derived AV nodal cell-like cells, followed by in vivo implantation in sheep models with permanent AV block. The study will assess the cells' capacity to bridge electrical activity between the atrium and ventricle, and protect against atrial tachycardia.\n\nIn collaboration with Medtronic, dedicated implantation catheters will be developed to facilitate the precise delivery of these cellular constructs. The project will also focus on optimizing the cellular constructs to meet regulatory compliance and prepare them for clinical testing.\n\nThe impact of this therapy could be profound, potentially broadening the applicability of biological pacing to nearly all pacemaker patients. This would not only reduce the incidence of pacemaker-related complications but also improve the quality of life for affected individuals and decrease healthcare expenditures. Our innovative strategy embodies a transformative step towards personalized cardiac therapy and a future of safer, more effective pacemaker alternatives."

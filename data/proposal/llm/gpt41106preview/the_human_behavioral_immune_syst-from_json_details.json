        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Human Behavioral Immune System: Consequences for Health and Innovation\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to investigate the human behavioral immune system (HBIS)â€”a suite of psychological mechanisms that have evolved over two million years to detect pathogens and motivate avoidance behaviors, critically shaping human health and behavior. Grounded in the field of evolutionary psychology, our project proposes an interdisciplinary approach to explore and understand the components of HBIS, including olfactory, emotion, and learning systems, and their impact on behaviors associated with pathogen risk, such as interpersonal contact, mating, and eating.\n\nThe project has three core objectives: (1) to elucidate the origins of trait variation in HBIS activation, (2) to determine the consequences of HBIS on behavior upon the detection of pathogen cues, and (3) to examine how HBIS influences the learning of avoidance and rejection behaviors. This research is poised to offer groundbreaking insights into the evolutionary underpinnings of human behavior and its implications for modern health practices and the acceptance of innovations such as soap, condoms, and indoor plumbing, which have historically reduced contact with viruses and bacteria, thereby increasing human lifespan and quality of life.\n\nMethodologically diverse studies will be carried out to investigate trait HBIS activation and its role in the rejection or acceptance of innovations, utilize state HBIS activation to promote the use of health technologies, and leverage HBIS in shaping dietary behavior. The anticipated outcomes of this research include a deeper understanding of how the HBIS impacts behavior and learning, strategies to encourage health-promoting technologies, and evidence-based approaches to modify dietary behaviors for improved health outcomes.\n\nUltimately, this research will illuminate the foundational role of HBIS in health and innovation, offering valuable knowledge for public health interventions, policy-making, and the development of technologies that align with our evolved behavioral tendencies."

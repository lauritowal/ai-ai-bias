        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"The Ocular Glymphatic System\" aims to pioneer research into the eye's glymphatic system—a recently discovered pathway responsible for the clearance of 65% of amyloid-beta from the normal adult brain—and its potential link to major neurodegenerative eye diseases such as macular degeneration and glaucoma. Our research team proposes a transformative hypothesis that these conditions are mechanistically related disorders with a common causal pathway rooted in the dysregulation of the glymphatic pathway.\n\nGiven the absence of traditional lymphatic vessels in the eye, our research seeks to elaborate on the ocular glymphatic system's role in clearing protein wastes, particularly amyloid-beta. We hypothesize that disruptions in this system could underlie the pathogenesis of macular degeneration and glaucoma, providing a novel therapeutic target.\n\nThe objectives of the proposal are fivefold: WP1 focuses on defining the cellular mechanisms driving ocular glymphatic transport of amyloid-beta using an ex vivo optic nerve model. WP2 aims to establish the existence of ocular glymphatic transport in live animals through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). WP3 will determine the regulative influence of the sleep-wake cycle on the ocular glymphatic system. WP4 tests whether suppressed ocular glymphatic transport leads to age-dependent macular degeneration due to toxic protein accumulation. Finally, WP5 explores the impact of increased intraocular pressure on glymphatic export of amyloid-beta and its relationship to glaucoma.\n\nThis research has the potential to link the biology of a new pathway for metabolic substrate and waste transport in the adult brain to eye diseases, offering groundbreaking insights into disorders that have long evaded a comprehensive understanding or effective treatment. By elucidating the glymphatic system's role in ocular health, we aim to open avenues for novel therapeutic strategies, potentially transforming the clinical approach to preventing and managing neurodegenerative eye diseases."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Gravitational Interferometry with Entangled States in Optical Fibers\n\nThe GRAVITES project proposes an innovative experimental venture combining the fields of quantum photonics, precision interferometry, general relativity, and quantum field theory. Our primary objective is to measure the gravitational properties of single and entangled photons within the framework of Einstein's general relativity using a state-of-the-art large-scale fiber interferometer. This ambitious endeavor aims to exceed the precision and sensitivity of current fiber-based quantum interferometers by orders of magnitude.\n\nThe project's scope includes the advancement of single-photon interferometry technology and the exploration of the combined effects of gravitation and field quantization in dielectric waveguides. By investigating the gravitational influence on quantum superposition and quantum entanglement, GRAVITES anticipates uncovering new physics at the intersection of gravity and the quantum realm, thereby creating an unprecedented experimental platform.\n\nThe interdisciplinary approach of GRAVITES integrates cutting-edge methodologies from the aforementioned disciplines to test the theoretical predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The outcomes of this research hold the potential to revolutionize quantum metrology and quantum sensing applications by providing enhanced sensitivity and novel insights into the fundamental interactions between quantum states and gravitational fields.\n\nIn conclusion, GRAVITES is poised to forge a path toward new scientific horizons, deepening our understanding of the universe by probing the subtle interplay between quantum phenomena and the fabric of spacetime, while simultaneously driving technological innovations with broad applicability in precision measurement and sensing technologies."

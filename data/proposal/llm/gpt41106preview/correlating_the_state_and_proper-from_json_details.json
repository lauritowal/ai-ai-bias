        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Correlating the State and Properties of Grain Boundaries\" (GB-CORRELATE) project aims to pioneer the prediction and manipulation of grain boundary (GB) phase transitions in polycrystalline materials, focusing on Cu and Al alloys fashioned into thin films. By establishing comprehensive guidelines for GB phase transitions and diagrams, the project endeavors to elucidate the correlation between GB phase transitions and subsequent changes in key material properties, such as GB strength, mobility, transport properties, and GB mechanics.\n\nGB-CORRELATE will adopt a hierarchical strategy, progressing from the study of individual special GB to the behavior of extensive GB networks. The project will implement a dual approach, combining statistical and combinatorial thin film deposition techniques to synthesize materials with precise solute elements, including Ag, Al, Cu, Si, Ni, and B. To ensure the comprehensive characterization of GB phases, the project will conduct high throughput grain growth experiments, utilize advanced atomic resolved correlated microscopy and spectroscopy, and perform sophisticated in-situ micromechanical studies.\n\nComplementing the experimental techniques, GB-CORRELATE will harness powerful computational approaches to identify distinct GB phases and predict their influence on material properties. The outcomes of this research will be tested by creating demonstrators exhibiting tailored GB strength and mobility, ultimately aiming to produce mechanically exceptional materials with enhanced performance.\n\nBy providing compositional-structural design criteria for GB engineering, GB-CORRELATE seeks to enable a new level of materials design, fostering the development of materials with unprecedented mechanical properties. This will have significant implications for industries where material performance is critical, such as aerospace, defense, and energy sectors."

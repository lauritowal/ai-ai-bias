        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"Correlating the State and Properties of Grain Boundaries\" (GB-CORRELATE), aims to revolutionize materials science by elucidating the fundamental relationships between grain boundary (GB) phases and material properties. This research endeavors to predict and resolve GB phase transitions, establish guidelines for GB phase diagrams, correlate these transitions with changes in material properties, and provide a compositional and structural foundation for GB engineering. The focus is on Copper (Cu) and Aluminum (Al) alloys in thin film form, which are critical to advancing fields like microelectronics and aerospace engineering.\n\nOur hierarchical strategy spans from the study of individual GB to complex GB networks and extends these concepts to thin film applications. We will employ a combinatorial approach to thin film deposition alongside high throughput grain growth experiments to rapidly synthesize and assess a wide range of GB configurations. Our investigative tools include advanced atomic-resolved correlated microscopy and spectroscopy, alongside sophisticated in-situ micromechanical studies to directly observe the behavior of GBs under stress. Additionally, powerful computational approaches will be used to identify and characterize various GB phases.\n\nThe project will explore the influence of solute elements such as Silver (Ag), Silicon (Si), Nickel (Ni), and Boron (B) on GB strength, mobility, transport properties, and mechanics. By integrating these experimental and computational methods, GB-CORRELATE seeks to provide groundbreaking insights into the control of GB phases, leading to the design of materials with exceptional mechanical properties. Demonstrators will be tested to validate the tailored GB strength and mobility achieved through our innovative approach. The outcomes of this research are expected to yield significant advancements in materials design, opening new avenues for the development of high-performance materials in various industrial sectors.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Correlating the State and Properties of Grain Boundaries (GB-CORRELATE)\n\nThe GB-CORRELATE project proposes a transformative approach to materials science, focusing on the understanding and control of grain boundary (GB) phases in copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) alloys, particularly in thin film form. Our central objective is to elucidate the GB phase transitions and their correlations with key materials properties such as GB strength, mobility, transport properties, and mechanics. By predicting and resolving GB phase transitions, we aim to establish comprehensive guidelines and GB phase diagrams that will inform the materials science community and enable the design of materials with unprecedented mechanical properties.\n\nTo achieve our goals, we will employ a hierarchical strategy that moves from the study of individual special GBs to networks of GBs. We will leverage advanced experimental techniques including combinatorial thin film deposition, high-throughput grain growth experiments, atomic-resolved correlated microscopy and spectroscopy, and in-situ micromechanical studies. These will be complemented by powerful computational approaches that will help in the identification of GB phases and the establishment of GB phase diagrams.\n\nOur focus on Cu and Al alloys, which are integral to numerous industrial applications, will be enhanced by the incorporation of solute elements such as Ag, Si, Ni, and B. This will allow us to assess the effects of varying composition on GB behavior and to provide compositional-structural design criteria for GB engineering.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of GB-CORRELATE is the development of mechanically exceptional materials through precise control of GB characteristics. This will be demonstrated by the creation of materials with tailored GB strength and mobility, directly impacting the fields of electronics, aerospace, and beyond. Ultimately, our project promises a new paradigm in materials design, where GB phase control leads to breakthroughs in materials performance and reliability.",

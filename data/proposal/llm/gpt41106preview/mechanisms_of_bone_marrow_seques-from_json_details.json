        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Mechanisms of Bone Marrow Sequestration During Malaria Infection\n\nMalaria remains a devastating public health problem, claiming over 600,000 lives annually, primarily among children in sub-Saharan Africa. The emergence of widespread resistance to current treatments underscores the urgent need for novel therapies. This innovative, multidisciplinary grant proposal aims to investigate the host-pathogen interactions at the interface between infected red blood cells and the bone marrow vasculature of humans infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The project targets a critical yet understudied aspect of malaria pathology: the sequestration of infected red blood cells in the bone marrow, which is essential for the parasite's life cycle completion and the development of gametocytes, the transmission stage of the parasite.\n\nRecent findings have confirmed the existence of an asexual parasite reservoir within the bone marrow, and the extracellular environment of the bone marrow is now recognized as a key location for gametocyte development. Building on these discoveries, our research will address three pivotal questions: (1) How do parasites home to the bone marrow? (2) What changes occur in the bone marrow endothelium upon infection? (3) How do parasites adhere to and transmigrate across the bone marrow vascular endothelium?\n\nThrough a detailed characterization of the interactions between the malaria parasite and the host vasculature, this research is expected to illuminate a new paradigm in malaria pathogenesis. The outcomes will not only advance scientific understanding but also have the potential to open new avenues for the development of intervention strategies. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial for devising innovative treatments to combat the malaria burden and save lives, particularly in regions where resistance to current therapies is a significant challenge."

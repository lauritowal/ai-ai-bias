        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, \"Pathogen-phage cooperation during mammalian infection,\" aims to unravel the complex interplay between bacteria and bacteriophages (phages) in the context of mammalian infections, focusing on the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Lysogeny, wherein bacteria carry prophages within their genome, is a widespread phenomenon; under specific stress conditions, these prophages can become infective, often resulting in the death of the host bacterium. The proposed study is premised on the observation that Lm's virulence is enhanced by infective prophages, suggesting a cooperative adaptation that enables the pathogen to thrive within the mammalian host without succumbing to phage-induced lysis.\n\nOur research objectives are to: 1) Investigate specific cross-regulatory and cooperative mechanisms between phage elements; 2) Study the domestication of phage remnant-derived regulatory factors; 3) Examine the auxiliary phage-control system that tempers infective phages; and 4) Explore how the mammalian niche influences the evolution of temperate phages into patho-adaptive entities.\n\nBuilding on previous discoveries that identified novel interactions between Lm and its prophages, and the dependence of prophages on regulatory factors from inactive remnants within the Lm chromosome, this research will provide groundbreaking insights into the coexistence of bacteria and phages within mammalian hosts. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of how cooperative mechanisms between pathogens and phages enhance virulence while maintaining a critical balance to prevent bacterial death. Ultimately, this work has the potential to facilitate the development of innovative phage therapy strategies, leveraging the nuanced relationships between pathogens and phages for therapeutic benefit."

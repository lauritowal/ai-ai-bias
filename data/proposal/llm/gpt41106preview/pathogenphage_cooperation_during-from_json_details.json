        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Pathogen-phage Cooperation during Mammalian Infection,\" seeks to address the complex interplay between bacterial pathogens and bacteriophages (phages) within mammalian hosts, focusing on Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). The phenomenon under investigation is the cooperative adaptation that enables Lm to enhance virulence while avoiding destruction by its own infective prophages. Lysogens, bacteria carrying prophage DNA, are known to turn this DNA into active phages under stress, potentially killing the host bacterium. Our research aims to uncover how these pathogens survive this internal threat during the invasion of mammalian cells.\n\nBuilding on previous discoveries that identified novel interactions where infective prophages promote the virulence of Lm and revealed that prophages are non-autonomous, relying on regulatory factors from inactive prophage remnants in the Lm chromosome, this proposal sets forth a comprehensive study. Our objectives include investigating the cross-regulatory and cooperative mechanisms of all phage elements, studying the domestication of phage remnant-derived regulatory factors, examining the auxiliary phage-control system that moderates infective phages, and exploring the mammalian niche-driven evolution of temperate phages into patho-adaptive phages.\n\nThe expected outcomes are two-fold: to offer novel insights into the coexistence of bacteria and phages within mammalian environments and to facilitate the development of innovative phage therapy strategies. The proposed research will significantly advance our understanding of microbial pathogenesis and symbiotic relationships, potentially revolutionizing the approach to treating bacterial infections. Through elucidating the underlying mechanisms of bacteria-phage cooperation, this study aims to pave the way for groundbreaking applications in medical microbiology and therapeutic interventions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Pathogen-phage cooperation during mammalian infection\n\nThe project named \"Pathogen-phage cooperation during mammalian infection\" aims to elucidate the sophisticated interplay between the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and bacteriophages (phages) within mammalian hosts. Lysogenic bacteria such as Lm carry prophages in their genomes, which have the potential to become infective and lyse their bacterial hosts under stress conditions. This study will explore the hypothesis that bacteria-phage cooperative adaptation enhances pathogen virulence during mammalian infection while simultaneously preventing the phages from inadvertently destroying their bacterial hosts.\n\nUtilizing a combination of molecular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics approaches, the research will investigate the cross-regulatory and cooperative mechanisms of all phage elements, including the domestication of phage remnant-derived regulatory factors. The study will further examine the auxiliary phage-control system that regulates infective phages, tempering their activity to favor bacterial survival and virulence. An additional focus will be on the evolutionary trajectory of temperate phages, hypothesizing that the mammalian niche drives their transformation into patho-adaptive phages that benefit their bacterial hosts.\n\nThis research builds upon previous discoveries identifying novel interactions between infective prophages and the virulence of Lm, and the understanding that prophages are non-autonomous entities reliant on regulatory factors from inactive prophage remnants within the Lm chromosome. The expected outcomes include novel insights into the coexistence strategies of bacteria and phages within mammalian environments, which could significantly advance the development of innovative phage therapy strategies. Ultimately, this project holds the potential to transform our understanding of microbial pathogenesis and to facilitate the creation of new therapeutics for bacterial infections.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, titled \"Pathogen-phage cooperation during mammalian infection,\" aims to unravel the complex interplay between bacterial pathogens and bacteriophages (phages) that underlie virulence in mammalian hosts, using Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) as the model organism. Lysogens, bacteria that harbor prophages, can under stress conditions produce infective viruses that typically lead to the bacterium's destruction. However, our preliminary findings suggest a cooperative adaptation that enhances bacterial virulence while simultaneously preventing the lethal consequences of phage induction.\n\nThis study will explore the intricate relationships between prophages and their bacterial hosts within the context of mammalian cell invasion. We hypothesize that cross-regulatory mechanisms and phage-control systems have evolved to allow Lm to exploit phage elements for increased virulence without succumbing to phage-mediated lysis. Earlier discoveries have highlighted that prophages in Lm are not self-sufficient but rather rely on regulatory factors from inactive prophage remnants within the bacterial chromosome. This points to a sophisticated regulatory network that governs phage activity and bacterial survival.\n\nOur multidisciplinary approach will investigate cross-regulatory and cooperative mechanisms among phage elements, study the domestication of phage remnant-derived regulatory factors, and examine the auxiliary phage-control system that tempers infective phages. Additionally, we will explore how the mammalian niche influences the evolution of temperate phages into patho-adaptive phages.\n\nThe expected outcomes include detailed insights into the coexistence strategies of bacteria and phages within mammalian hosts and the facilitation of novel phage therapy strategies. By enhancing our understanding of bacterial-phage dynamics, this research has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of bacterial infections and mitigate the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, \"Pathogen-phage cooperation during mammalian infection,\" aims to unravel the complex interplay between bacteria and bacteriophages (phages) in the context of mammalian infections, focusing on the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Lysogeny, wherein bacteria carry prophages within their genome, is a widespread phenomenon; under specific stress conditions, these prophages can become infective, often resulting in the death of the host bacterium. The proposed study is premised on the observation that Lm's virulence is enhanced by infective prophages, suggesting a cooperative adaptation that enables the pathogen to thrive within the mammalian host without succumbing to phage-induced lysis.\n\nOur research objectives are to: 1) Investigate specific cross-regulatory and cooperative mechanisms between phage elements; 2) Study the domestication of phage remnant-derived regulatory factors; 3) Examine the auxiliary phage-control system that tempers infective phages; and 4) Explore how the mammalian niche influences the evolution of temperate phages into patho-adaptive entities.\n\nBuilding on previous discoveries that identified novel interactions between Lm and its prophages, and the dependence of prophages on regulatory factors from inactive remnants within the Lm chromosome, this research will provide groundbreaking insights into the coexistence of bacteria and phages within mammalian hosts. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of how cooperative mechanisms between pathogens and phages enhance virulence while maintaining a critical balance to prevent bacterial death. Ultimately, this work has the potential to facilitate the development of innovative phage therapy strategies, leveraging the nuanced relationships between pathogens and phages for therapeutic benefit."

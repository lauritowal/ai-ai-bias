        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Coping with decline: Comparative social-historical analysis of depopulation and community welfare in Europe, 1950-2022\" (DEPOP) aims to address the critical issue of depopulation—a \"slow burn crisis\"—affecting various regions across Europe. This interdisciplinary research seeks to understand how communities confront and adapt to the challenges posed by shrinking populations, school and hospital closures, and the resultant strain on welfare provisions.\n\nDEPOP will focus on three case study regions—Finland, the Netherlands, and Ukraine—to map demographic trajectories and welfare provision links, investigate community coping strategies, and develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing community welfare during extended periods of decline. The project's novel multi-level approach will employ compositional demography and the historical concept of communication communities to dissect the issue at macro (population and state welfare data), meso (social organizations), and micro (individual experiences) levels.\n\nDrawing upon a rich array of data sources, including reports, regional statistics, archives, witness seminars, and oral histories, DEPOP will provide a historical perspective on current conditions. The project will reveal how rural and urban communities have historically navigated the complexity of depopulation and its implications for welfare, offering an unprecedented comparative framework to study such affected communities.\n\nThe expected outcome of DEPOP is to significantly advance our understanding of community resilience and inform policy-making for regions confronting similar slow burn crises in the future. By uncovering the coping mechanisms developed over more than seven decades, this research will contribute valuable insights into sustainable community welfare strategies in the face of demographic decline. The findings of DEPOP will enable stakeholders to better support affected communities, ensuring social cohesion and well-being amidst challenging demographic transitions."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Precision Medicine Approach to Rare Vascular Malformations to Enhance Understanding, Diagnostics, and Therapy\n\nRare vascular malformations present as a spectrum ranging from innocuous birthmarks to life-threatening conditions involving limbs, organs, or large body areas. Current clinical interventions, both surgical and pharmacological, face substantial challenges. These include a lack of comprehensive histological understanding, limited genetic diagnostics, and generally poor outcomes from existing treatments, which often lead to disease progression, high rates of drug side effects, and non-response to therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, our proposal aims to revolutionize the approach to these malformations through precision medicine.\n\nWe propose an innovative, multidisciplinary workflow that integrates three core components: a novel AI-assisted 3D-Histology method for advanced histological classification, enhanced genetic diagnostic testing utilizing state-of-the-art sequencing techniques and bioinformatics tools, and patient-tailored pharmacological treatments derived from FDA-approved drug sub-library screenings on patient-derived cells, facilitated by cutting-edge imaging techniques.\n\nOur approach is poised to transform clinical practice by providing the first truly state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment strategies for patients with vascular malformations. The outcomes anticipated include halting disease progression, significantly improving patients' quality of life, and reducing the risks associated with current therapies. By leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, genomics, and pharmacology, we are committed to leading a paradigm shift in the care of individuals suffering from these heterogeneous and challenging disorders. This project holds the promise to set new standards in precision medicine, ultimately benefitting a patient population that has previously been underserved by medical science."

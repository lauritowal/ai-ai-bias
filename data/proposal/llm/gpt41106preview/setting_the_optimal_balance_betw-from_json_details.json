        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Setting the Optimal Balance between Metabolite Supplementation and Deprivation in Cancer Therapy\n\nThe proposed project aims to explore the intersection of targeted metabolite supplementation and global nutrient restriction to disrupt and reprogram cancer metabolism, with the ultimate goal of halting tumor progression and enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatments. Building on the foundation of both published and unpublished studies, which have shown that global nutrient restriction can reduce tumor progression and prolong survival, and that certain amino acids or fatty acids have antitumor effects that are enhanced by nutrient starvation, this project seeks to refine these strategies and translate them into clinical practice.\n\nEmploying a comprehensive methodological approach that includes cell biology and biochemical experiments, polysome/ribosome profiling, isotope tracing experiments, and integrated omics analyses (transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic), we will investigate the mechanisms by which metabolite supplementation, coupled with nutrient restriction, can exert antitumor effects. The project utilizes both in vitro and in vivo models, including murine and human tumor systems, to ensure robust and clinically applicable findings.\n\nThe project's objectives are two-fold: first, to identify the underlying mechanisms that confer antitumor benefits from the precise balance of nutrient supplementation and restriction; and second, to develop an effective supplementation-restriction strategy suitable for evaluation in a first-in-human clinical trial focusing on advanced triple-negative breast cancer, a notoriously difficult-to-treat cancer subtype.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include the identification of novel combinations of metabolite supplementation and restriction that could redefine therapeutic strategies for cancer metabolism. These findings are expected to have significant scientific and translational implications for improving patient survival and quality of life by informing the next generation of metabolic-based cancer therapies.\n\nKeywords: Cancer Therapy, Metabolite Supplementation, Nutrient Restriction, Tumor Metabolism, Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Setting the Optimal Balance between Metabolite Supplementation and Deprivation in Cancer Therapy\n\nThe proposed project aims to explore the intricate balance between targeted metabolite supplementation and global nutrient restriction as a novel approach in reprogramming tumor metabolism, with the ultimate goal of halting tumor progression and enhancing treatment outcomes, particularly in advanced triple-negative breast cancer. Drawing upon a foundation of both published and unpublished studies that suggest the antitumor effects of both global nutrient restriction and specific nutrient supplementation, our research seeks to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of action and to develop an effective strategy for clinical application.\n\nEmploying a robust methodology that encompasses cell biology and biochemical experiments, advanced techniques such as polysome/ribosome profiling, and isotope tracing experiments, alongside integrated omics analyses (transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic), the project will provide comprehensive insights into the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Using a combination of in vitro models and in vivo murine and human tumor models, we will systematically identify the antitumor mechanisms triggered by the strategic balance of metabolite supplementation with nutrient deprivation.\n\nOur objectives are twofold: firstly, to identify the mechanisms by which targeted metabolite supplementation combined with global nutrient restriction exerts antitumor effects, and secondly, to pinpoint the most effective supplementation-restriction strategy for potential translation into a first-in-human clinical trial targeting advanced triple-negative breast cancer. The success of this project holds significant promise for scientific and translational advancements, offering a potential paradigm shift in cancer metabolism treatment strategies. Ultimately, our findings could pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions that improve patient survival and quality of life.\n\nKeywords: cancer therapy, tumor metabolism, nutrient restriction, metabolite supplementation, triple-negative breast cancer, preclinical studies, clinical trial.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Setting the optimal balance between metabolite supplementation and deprivation in cancer therapy,\" aims to revolutionize the treatment of cancer by meticulously exploring the interplay between targeted metabolite supplementation and global nutrient restriction to reprogram tumor metabolism, halt tumor progression, and enhance treatment responses. Grounded in both published and unpublished evidence, the research indicates that while global nutrient restriction can diminish tumor growth and extend survival, specific amino acid or fatty acid supplementation may possess synergistic antitumor effects when paired with nutrient starvation.\n\nEmploying a multi-faceted methodological approach, the project will conduct cell biology and biochemical experiments, polysome/ribosome profiling, isotope tracing experiments, and integrated omics analyses, including transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies. These will be applied to both in vitro and in vivo models, encompassing murine and human tumors, to ensure comprehensive and translational findings. \n\nThe objectives of the study are twofold: first, to elucidate the underlying antitumor mechanisms triggered by the strategic combination of metabolite supplementation with nutrient restriction; and second, to identify the most effective supplementation-restriction strategy for a pioneering first-in-human clinical trial targeting advanced triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nThis proposal stands at the vanguard of the nutrient deprivation versus supplementation debate in cancer research. It promises to yield novel combinations of balanced metabolite supplementation and restriction, potentially paving the way for new, highly effective cancer treatment regimens. By achieving a deeper understanding of cancer metabolism and its susceptibility to dietary modulation, the project holds significant scientific and translational implications, with the potential to markedly improve patient survival outcomes.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Setting the optimal balance between metabolite supplementation and deprivation in cancer therapy\" aims to revolutionize cancer treatment by exploring the synergistic effects of targeted metabolite supplementation alongside global nutrient restriction to reprogram tumor metabolism, thereby inhibiting tumor progression and improving patient response to therapy. This innovative approach stands on the foundation of both published and unpublished studies that suggest the potential antitumor benefits of specific amino acids or fatty acids when combined with nutrient starvation.\n\nOur multi-faceted methodology will integrate cell biology and biochemical experiments, cutting-edge polysome/ribosome profiling, isotope tracing experiments, and comprehensive integrated omics analyses (transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of cancer metabolism. These methodologies will be applied across robust models that span in vitro systems and in vivo murine and human tumor models, ensuring the relevance and translatability of our findings.\n\nThe primary objectives of this proposal are twofold: Firstly, to identify the mechanisms through which targeted metabolite supplementation paired with nutrient restriction exerts antitumor effects. Secondly, to determine the most effective combination of supplementation and restriction strategies for a pioneering first-in-human clinical trial aimed at treating advanced triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nWe envision that this project will yield groundbreaking insights into the delicate interplay between metabolite availability and cancer growth, potentially leading to the development of novel, refined treatment regimens. Our ultimate goal is to pave the way for new therapies that strategically balance metabolite supplementation and deprivation, offering a beacon of hope for improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Setting the optimal balance between metabolite supplementation and deprivation in cancer therapy\" aims to revolutionize cancer treatment by exploring the synergistic effects of targeted metabolite supplementation alongside global nutrient restriction to reprogram tumor metabolism, thereby inhibiting tumor progression and improving patient response to therapy. This innovative approach stands on the foundation of both published and unpublished studies that suggest the potential antitumor benefits of specific amino acids or fatty acids when combined with nutrient starvation.\n\nOur multi-faceted methodology will integrate cell biology and biochemical experiments, cutting-edge polysome/ribosome profiling, isotope tracing experiments, and comprehensive integrated omics analyses (transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of cancer metabolism. These methodologies will be applied across robust models that span in vitro systems and in vivo murine and human tumor models, ensuring the relevance and translatability of our findings.\n\nThe primary objectives of this proposal are twofold: Firstly, to identify the mechanisms through which targeted metabolite supplementation paired with nutrient restriction exerts antitumor effects. Secondly, to determine the most effective combination of supplementation and restriction strategies for a pioneering first-in-human clinical trial aimed at treating advanced triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nWe envision that this project will yield groundbreaking insights into the delicate interplay between metabolite availability and cancer growth, potentially leading to the development of novel, refined treatment regimens. Our ultimate goal is to pave the way for new therapies that strategically balance metabolite supplementation and deprivation, offering a beacon of hope for improved survival and quality of life for cancer patients."

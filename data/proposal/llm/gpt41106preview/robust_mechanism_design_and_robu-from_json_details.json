        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Robust Mechanism Design and Robust Prediction in Games\n\nThe proposed research project aims to revolutionize the field of Game Theory and Mechanism Design Theory by developing robust theoretical frameworks and mechanisms that operate effectively under less restrictive assumptions. Recognizing the limitations of existing studies, which often rely on narrow economic environment classes and restrictive assumptions such as independently distributed private information and common-knowledge priors, this project intends to address these gaps by offering innovative contributions to the literature.\n\nThe core objectives of the project are threefold: to provide an in-depth analysis of mechanism design within correlated environments, to predict playersâ€™ behavior in games with incompletely specified information, and to identify conditions that enable the application of monotone comparative statics. The project will focus on the practical relevance of these theoretical advancements by designing economic institutions that better align with desired social objectives and providing policy recommendations grounded in robust empirical studies.\n\nOur novel contributions include the creation of less assumption-dependent frameworks, the establishment of robust mechanisms suitable for correlated environments, and the enhancement of the practical and empirical relevance of game theoretic models. These contributions are expected to significantly improve the validity of policy recommendations and the reliability of empirical studies in economics.\n\nThe research methodologies encompass the development of robustness-based mechanisms and theoretical frameworks that can withstand the complexities of real-world applications, including auction design and the functioning of economic institutions. By bridishing the gap between theory and practice, the project promises to have a transformative impact on the field, fostering the creation of economic policies and institutions that are both efficient and equitable in a variety of strategic settings.\n\nKeywords: Game Theory, Mechanism Design Theory, Robust Mechanisms, Economic Institutions, Agent Behavior, Policy Recommendations, Empirical Studies."

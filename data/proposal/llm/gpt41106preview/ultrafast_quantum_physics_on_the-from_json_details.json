        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Ultrafast Quantum Physics on the Sub-cycle Time Scale\" project represents a groundbreaking effort in the field of Condensed Matter Physics, aimed at pushing the boundaries of our understanding of quantum phenomena. Leveraging state-of-the-art technologies including femtosecond light pulses, terahertz technology, and nanooptics, the initiative is poised to control condensed matter on unprecedented sub-cycle timescales.\n\nWith objectives that span the manipulation of electronic charge, spin, and photons, the project seeks to explore the non-adiabatic regime of quantum physics. It will test theoretical concepts like relativistic quantum transport and the Zitterbewegung of Dirac fermions, which have remained elusive to experimentalists. The use of extreme electric fields (10 GV/m) and magnetic fields (several 10 Tesla) will enable the team to switch the spin direction in magnetic materials and observe phenomena such as Bloch oscillations in bulk semiconductors with unparalleled precision.\n\nThe proposed research will also advance the sensitivity of electro-optic sampling to the few-photon level, thus paving the way for the direct detection of the quantum nature of the oscillating carrier wave in the time domain. Further, it holds the potential to trace the spontaneous creation of photons from quantum vacua, a testament to the project's innovative approach in probing the foundations of quantum electrodynamics and solid-state physics.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include achieving record control speeds in magnetic material spin direction switching and gaining new insights into the fastest magnetic elementary processes. By tailoring extreme electric and magnetic near-fields spatio-temporally, this project aims to pioneer a new era of quantum physics research with applications in quantum optics and magnetism. The transformative nature of this research promises to redefine our understanding of quantum dynamics and could lead to significant technological advancements in the control of quantum systems.",

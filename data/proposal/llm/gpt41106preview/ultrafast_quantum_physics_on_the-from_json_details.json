        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Ultrafast Quantum Physics on the Sub-Cycle Time Scale,\" seeks funding to explore the forefront of condensed matter physics through pioneering techniques in ultrafast dynamics. The project's goal is to control electronic charge, spin, and photons within materials on a time scale faster than the oscillation cycle of light, thereby uncovering non-adiabatic quantum phenomena and advancing our understanding of relativistic quantum transport.\n\nUtilizing state-of-the-art technologies such as femtosecond light pulses, sub-cycle optics, terahertz technology, nanooptics, and electro-optic sampling, the research team aims to achieve groundbreaking objectives. These include controlling condensed matter in sub-cycle times, testing unobserved relativistic quantum transport concepts, switching spin direction in magnetic materials using intense magnetic or electric fields, and advancing the sensitivity of electro-optic sampling to new limits. The project will employ electric fields of 10 GV/m and magnetic fields of several 10 Tesla to manipulate quantum states.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes are significant, promising the observation of Zitterbewegung of Dirac fermions, Bloch oscillations in bulk semiconductors, record control speeds in spin direction switching within magnetic materials, and the direct detection of quantum effects such as the oscillating carrier wave's quantum nature and the spontaneous creation of photons from quantum vacua. These outcomes not only hold the potential for profound scientific discovery but also could have far-reaching implications in quantum electrodynamics, solid-state physics, magnetism, and field-resolved quantum optics.\n\nThis research is expected to provide deep insights into the fastest magnetic elementary processes and the electronic charge dynamics at unprecedented time scales, positioning the field of quantum physics for transformative advances."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Integrated Structural and Probabilistic Approaches for Biological and Epidemiological Systems\" (INSPIRE) project aims to develop a comprehensive framework enabling the analysis and control of complex and uncertain dynamical systems within the realms of biology and epidemiology. Recognizing the robust nature of biological systems amidst significant variability, this research endeavors to address the challenges posed by their nonlinear dynamics and the intricate interplay of numerous parameters. The project's ultimate goal is to elucidate phenomena such as cellular dynamics, the emergence of diseases, and the spread of epidemics.\n\nINSPIRE will pursue the integration of structural, robust, and probabilistic methods to achieve its objectives. A key innovation lies in parameter-free structural approaches, which will assess whether certain properties are inherent to the system's configuration rather than dependent on specific parameter values. This will facilitate the identification of invariant system features and key parameters that are critical for robustness.\n\nThe project will yield a novel methodology for analyzing structural properties and pinpointing essential motifs, establishing control paradigms that secure desired global behaviors via local interventions, and developing scaling and aggregation strategies to reduce computational demands by leveraging the attributes of subsystems.\n\nINSPIRE's outputs are expected to include a mathematical theory and algorithms that will significantly advance our capacity to analyze and control complex uncertain systems. The practical applications of these findings span the analysis and design of biomolecular feedback mechanisms, the identification of therapeutic targets in medical research, and the enhancement of strategies for predicting and managing epidemic outbreaks.\n\nBy synthesizing structural and probabilistic approaches, INSPIRE sets the stage for groundbreaking contributions to our understanding and manipulation of biological and epidemiological systems, potentially transforming practices in biomedical engineering, public health policy, and beyond."

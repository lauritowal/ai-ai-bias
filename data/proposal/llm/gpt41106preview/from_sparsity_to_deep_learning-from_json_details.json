        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"from SPArsity to DEep learning\" (SPADE) proposal addresses a critical deficiency in deep learning (DL)—the lack of a robust theoretical foundation. Despite the empirical success of DL in various applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain underexplored, especially in domains such as computer vision, signal & image processing, and language processing. SPADE proposes to bridge this gap by leveraging the well-established theoretical framework of sparse representations, a data model extensively employed in fields like medical imaging and signal processing.\n\nThe project's fundamental aim is to broaden the success of DL by improving its performance in the unsupervised regime and on regression tasks, which are currently less understood and underperforming. By integrating sparsity tools—long known for their efficacy in capturing data structure—SPADE seeks to illuminate the role of data structure in DL and use this insight to advance sparse model solutions. This initiative will lead to the development of a unified theoretical framework that marries the strengths of sparsity with the flexibility and power of DL.\n\nSPADE's innovative approach promises to catalyze a new generation of learning methods and architectures. Its potential impact is vast, envisaging DL advancements in novel domains and tasks that are currently intractable. With a clear focus on theoretical rigor, SPADE is poised to set new benchmarks in these fields, leading to transformative outcomes that could reshape the landscape of DL research and application. The project underscores the significance of a grounded theoretical approach to DL, which will not only enhance performance but also provide a deeper understanding of the learning mechanisms, ultimately fostering innovation in various real-world applications."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Non-Volatile Magnetic Flip Flop\" (NOVOFLOP) project presents a groundbreaking shift in digital memory and computation technology, addressing the imminent limitations of conventional CMOS scaling and the prohibitively high costs of future technology nodes. Recognizing the need for alternative technologies, NOVOFLOP offers a novel solution rooted in the use of spin for computation and information storage, capitalizing on its nonvolatility, high endurance, fast operation, and CMOS compatibility. This spin-based computational principle, supported by technology innovations such as the spin transfer torque effect and magnetic exchange coupling, enables complete device operation within the magnetic domain, thereby eliminating the power-consuming signal conversion between CMOS and spintronic domains.\n\nThe proposed non-volatile magnetic flip flop promises an unprecedented integration density with a minuscule footprint of just 10nm x 40nm for a reset-set (RS) flip flop, significantly higher than the current CMOS/Spintronic hybrid solutions. Furthermore, the design allows for stacking into a shift register, further enhancing its potential applications in dense memory architectures. Micromagnetic simulations have validated the design, and the project is now poised to enter the next phase, which includes manufacturing prototypes, enhancing device performance, and improving simulation tools.\n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to create the NOVOFLOP package, which will encompass device prototypes, TCAD models, and a robust manufacturing process. This technology is poised to revolutionize the field of memory and computation, with a keen eye on meeting the ever-increasing demands for higher density and lower power consumption. The target audience encompasses technology companies and venture capitalists who are at the forefront of adopting and investing in innovative computational technologies that are positioned to transcend the limitations of current paradigms."

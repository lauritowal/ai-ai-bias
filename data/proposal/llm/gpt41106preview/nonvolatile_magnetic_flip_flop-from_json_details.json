        "Abstract:\n\nThe relentless pursuit of Moore's Law has brought CMOS technology to its physical and economic limits, necessitating a paradigm shift in computational technology. The proposed project, \"Non-Volatile Magnetic Flip Flop\" (NOVOFLOP), aims to transcend these barriers by harnessing the spin of electrons for computation and information storage. This innovative approach promises nonvolatility, high endurance, fast operation, and seamless CMOS compatibility—critical attributes for the next generation of compact and energy-efficient computing devices.\n\nNOVOFLOP will leverage cutting-edge phenomena such as the spin transfer torque effect and magnetic exchange coupling to realize a non-volatile magnetic flip flop that operates entirely within the magnetic domain, eliminating the need for energy-intensive signal conversions between CMOS and spintronic systems. The project's ambitious goal is to achieve an unprecedented integration density, with a proposed device footprint of only 10nm x 40nm per RS flip flop. Additionally, these devices are designed to be stackable, paving the way for highly dense shift registers and further miniaturization.\n\nMicromagnetic simulations have already validated the foundational concepts, and the next phase will focus on the manufacture of prototypes, enhancement of device performance, and refinement of simulation tools. The expected outcomes include the establishment of a manufacturing process for the device, development of TCAD models, and creation of functional prototypes. Once achieved, NOVOFLOP will offer a comprehensive package for device presentation to interested technology companies and venture capitalists.\n\nThis project stands at the forefront of a revolution in computing technology, promising to overcome the current limitations of CMOS scaling and high future technology node costs. By offering a solution that is both highly competitive in power consumption and speed, NOVOFLOP represents a significant stride towards the future of high-density, energy-efficient computation.",

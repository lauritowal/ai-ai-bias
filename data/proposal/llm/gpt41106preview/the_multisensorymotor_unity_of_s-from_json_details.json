        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: The Multisensory-Motor Unity of Speech\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project titled \"The Multisensory-Motor Unity of Speech\" which aims to delve into the intricate process of speech unification involving the integration of auditory, visual, and motor streams. The project stands on the foundation of the Perception-for-Action-Control Theory (PACT), an established framework developed by the principal investigator (PI). PACT offers a perceptuo-motor theory of speech communication that systematically associates perceptual shaping with motor procedural knowledge, emphasizing the role of perceptually shaped gestures as the core communication units.\n\nThe proposed interdisciplinary research will leverage methodologies from cognitive psychology, neurosciences, phonetics, and computational modeling to dissect and understand the complex interactions between multisensory processing and speech production. The project is divided into two primary actions: Extracting Units and Developing Units.\n\nExtracting Units focuses on the study of audio-visuo-motor speech unit extraction, employing the analysis of multimodal corpora, collection of behavioral and neurophysiological data, and the development of neurocomputational models that simulate the binding process. This action aims to segment streams into coherent audiovisual units that are essential for speech perception.\n\nDeveloping Units is dedicated to gathering phonetic data on the joint development of speech units and implementing as well as testing computational models that will assess the emergence and evolution of these perceptuo-motor speech units. This action seeks to understand how speech units are shaped over time, from acquisition to learning and reacquisition.\n\nThe project's ultimate objective is to elucidate how multisensory speech units are perceived and produced within the human brain, linking auditory, visual, and motor systems through immediate online unification and developmental offline joint emergence processes. The outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of speech communication and could have profound implications for speech therapy, artificial intelligence speech synthesis, and the development of advanced human-computer interfaces."

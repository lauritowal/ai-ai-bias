        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The multisensory-motor unity of speech,\" aims to elucidate the intricate process of speech unification through the integration of auditory, visual, and motor streams. Engaging an interdisciplinary approach that spans cognitive psychology, neurosciences, phonetics, and computational modeling, this project seeks to leverage the Perception-for-Action-Control Theory (PACT) to investigate the perceptuo-motor dynamics of speech communication. The principal investigator (PI) has significantly contributed to the development of PACT, which proposes that the unit of communication is a perceptually shaped gesture, characterized by articulatory coherence and perceptual value.\n\nThe project is structured into two main parts: Extracting Units and Developing Units. In the Extracting Units phase, the study focuses on analyzing a multimodal corpus and collecting behavioral and neurophysiological data to develop neurocomputational models of the audio-visuo-motor binding process. This effort aims to extract coherent audiovisual speech units in the brain, segmenting the streams into perceptually meaningful units.\n\nDuring the Developing Units phase, the project will collect phonetic data on the joint development of speech units and implement as well as test computational models. This stage is designed to assess the emergence and evolution of perceptuo-motor speech units, exploring how they are acquired and reacquired over time.\n\nBy understanding the online unification of sensory and motor streams and the offline joint emergence of perceptual and motor repertoires, the project will provide profound insights into the perceptuo-motor theory of speech communication. The results promise to advance our knowledge of multisensory processing in the human brain during speech perception and production, potentially informing the development of new technologies and therapeutic approaches for communication disorders.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The multisensory-motor unity of speech,\" aims to elucidate the complex integration process of auditory, visual, and motor streams during speech perception and production. The project leverages an interdisciplinary approach, combining insights and methodologies from cognitive psychology, neurosciences, phonetics, and computational modeling. Central to the project is the application of the Perception-for-Action-Control Theory (PACT), a framework developed by the Principal Investigator (PI) that posits speech communication as a perceptually shaped gesture unit characterized by its articulatory coherence and perceptual value.\n\nThe project is divided into two main components: Extracting Units and Developing Units. Extracting Units focuses on analyzing a multimodal corpus to study how the brain segments and extracts coherent audio-visuo-motor speech units. This involves collecting behavioral and neurophysiological data and developing neurocomputational models of the binding process. The goal is to understand the online unification of sensory and motor streams as they occur in real-time.\n\nDeveloping Units aims to assess the offline joint emergence and evolution of perceptuo-motor speech units. This is achieved through the collection of phonetic data on the developmental processes of speech units and the implementation and testing of computational models. The focus here is on how perception and action jointly contribute to the phonology of speech through acquisition, reacquisition, evolution, and learning processes.\n\nThis project promises to advance our understanding of the multisensory processing involved in speech communication. By investigating the integration of sensory and motor streams in the human brain, it seeks to provide insights into the immediate and developmental aspects of multisensory speech unit perception and production. The findings could have significant implications for improving communication technologies, speech therapy strategies, and robotic speech synthesis.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"The multisensory-motor unity of speech,\" aims to explore the complex process of speech unification and the integration of auditory, visual, and motor streams in the human brain. The project is grounded in the interdisciplinary fields of cognitive psychology, neurosciences, phonetics, and computational models, utilizing the Perception-for-Action-Control Theory (PACT). Developed by the Principal Investigator (PI), PACT is a perceptuo-motor theory of speech communication that underscores the interconnection between perceptual shaping and motor procedural knowledge.\n\nThe research will be conducted in two main parts: Extracting Units and Developing Units. In the Extracting Units phase, the team will analyze multimodal corpora, and collect behavioral and neurophysiological data to develop neurocomputational models of the audio-visuo-motor binding process. The objective is to identify how the brain extracts coherent audiovisual units from multisensory speech streams.\n\nThe Developing Units phase will focus on the collection of phonetic data to understand the joint development of speech units, implementing and testing computational models to assess the emergence and evolution of perceptuo-motor speech units. This includes studying the acquisition, reacquisition, evolution, and learning processes of speech.\n\nThe project emphasizes the perceptually shaped gesture as the unit of communication, characterized by articulatory coherence and perceptual value. The research will investigate the roles of perceptuo-motor links in the online unification of sensory and motor streams and the offline joint emergence of perceptual and motor repertoires.\n\nBy leveraging a robust theoretical framework and an interdisciplinary approach, the project aims to provide insights into the multisensory processing of speech, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the perception and production of speech units. The findings have the potential to inform new strategies for speech therapy and contribute to the advancement of technologies for human-computer interaction.",
        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: The Multisensory-Motor Unity of Speech\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project titled \"The Multisensory-Motor Unity of Speech\" which aims to delve into the intricate process of speech unification involving the integration of auditory, visual, and motor streams. The project stands on the foundation of the Perception-for-Action-Control Theory (PACT), an established framework developed by the principal investigator (PI). PACT offers a perceptuo-motor theory of speech communication that systematically associates perceptual shaping with motor procedural knowledge, emphasizing the role of perceptually shaped gestures as the core communication units.\n\nThe proposed interdisciplinary research will leverage methodologies from cognitive psychology, neurosciences, phonetics, and computational modeling to dissect and understand the complex interactions between multisensory processing and speech production. The project is divided into two primary actions: Extracting Units and Developing Units.\n\nExtracting Units focuses on the study of audio-visuo-motor speech unit extraction, employing the analysis of multimodal corpora, collection of behavioral and neurophysiological data, and the development of neurocomputational models that simulate the binding process. This action aims to segment streams into coherent audiovisual units that are essential for speech perception.\n\nDeveloping Units is dedicated to gathering phonetic data on the joint development of speech units and implementing as well as testing computational models that will assess the emergence and evolution of these perceptuo-motor speech units. This action seeks to understand how speech units are shaped over time, from acquisition to learning and reacquisition.\n\nThe project's ultimate objective is to elucidate how multisensory speech units are perceived and produced within the human brain, linking auditory, visual, and motor systems through immediate online unification and developmental offline joint emergence processes. The outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of speech communication and could have profound implications for speech therapy, artificial intelligence speech synthesis, and the development of advanced human-computer interfaces."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Magneto-Acoustic Waves in Complex Spin Systems\" (MAWiCS), aims to revolutionize spintronics by pioneering the magneto-acoustic control of magnetization in advanced magnetic materials such as ferrimagnets, antiferromagnets, and chiral magnets. Current spintronic devices, crucial for information storage and processing, face significant challenges in efficient control using magnetic fields and electrical currents. MAWiCS seeks to address these challenges by exploiting microwave frequency phonons to excite and manipulate spin waves and magnetic skyrmion lattices with unprecedented efficiency.\n\nOur innovative approach hinges on three core hypotheses: firstly, that magneto-acoustic interactions can induce uniaxial magnetic anisotropy allowing full modulation of antiferromagnetic resonance frequencies; secondly, that magneto-acoustic waves can excite and control antiferromagnetic spin waves with high efficiency; and thirdly, that these waves can propagate in topologically protected skyrmion lattice edge states with significantly reduced magnetic damping. To test these hypotheses, we will develop experimental techniques that leverage symmetry, topology, and exchange-enhancement effects.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes include the generation of nanoscale spin waves using acoustic pulses, the control of skyrmions through acoustic lattices to realize nanoscale topological acoustics, and the excitation and detection of antiferromagnetic spin waves via acoustic two-tone modulation. Success in these areas will pave the way for the technological realization of magneto-acoustic spintronic devices, enable antiferromagnetic magnonics, and facilitate topological magnon transport.\n\nUltimately, MAWiCS aims to pioneer a new class of information technology concepts with vastly improved performance and novel functionalities, leading to transformative advancements in the field of spintronics and beyond.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe MAWiCS project aims to revolutionize the field of spintronics by harnessing magneto-acoustic waves for the control of magnetization in complex spin systems, including ferrimagnets, antiferromagnets, and chiral magnets. Current spintronic devices, which play pivotal roles in information storage and processing, face significant challenges in the form of inefficient control using magnetic fields and electrical currents. Our project proposes to address these challenges by developing a novel magneto-acoustic control method, which is hypothesized to excite and modulate antiferromagnetic spin waves and magnetic skyrmions lattices with microwave frequency phonons efficiently.\n\nWe anticipate that our innovative experimental approaches, utilizing symmetry, topology, and exchange-enhancement effects, will allow for the generation of nanoscale spin waves from acoustic pulses and the control of skyrmions by acoustic lattices, thereby enabling nanoscale topological acoustics. Moreover, we propose the use of acoustic two-tone modulation to excite and detect antiferromagnetic spin waves, with the potential to pioneer magneto-acoustic spintronic devices, antiferromagnetic magnonics, and topological magnon transport.\n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to lead to a new class of information technology concepts characterized by ultrafast speed, enhanced robustness, and unique functionalities. By overcoming existing obstacles and leveraging the anticipated results of magneto-acoustic control, MAWiCS promises to pave the way for technological advancements that offer increased performance and novel functionalities in the realm of spintronics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe MAWiCS (Magneto-Acoustic Waves in Complex Spin Systems) project represents an innovative research endeavor aimed at revolutionizing spintronic devices through the magneto-acoustic control of magnetization in complex spin systems, including ferrimagnets, antiferromagnets, and chiral magnets. These systems are integral to advancing information storage and processing technologies, but their potential is hindered by the current inefficiency in their control via magnetic fields and electrical currents. MAWiCS addresses these challenges by testing the hypotheses that microwave frequency phonons can efficiently excite and control antiferromagnetic spin waves and magnetic skyrmions lattices, that uniaxial magnetic anisotropy induced by magneto-acoustic interactions can modulate antiferromagnetic resonance frequencies fully, and that magneto-acoustic waves can propagate in topologically protected skyrmion lattice edge-states with reduced magnetic damping.\n\nThe project will develop innovative experimental approaches exploiting symmetry, topology, and exchange-enhancement effects to achieve ultrafast, robust, and uniquely functional spin dynamics control. It aims to generate nanoscale spin waves from acoustic pulses, control skyrmions via acoustic lattices to realize nanoscale topological acoustics, and excite and detect antiferromagnetic spin waves with acoustic two-tone modulation.\n\nAnticipated results include the technological realization of magneto-acoustic spintronic devices, enabling antiferromagnetic magnonics, and the realization of topological magnon transport.

        "Abstract:\n\nThe quest for next-generation spintronic devices that offer ultrafast information storage and processing capabilities is at the forefront of materials science and condensed matter physics. The \"Magneto-Acoustic Waves in Complex Spin Systems\" (MAWiCS) project represents a pioneering effort to address the critical challenge of efficiently controlling magnetization in advanced materials such as ferrimagnets, antiferromagnets, and chiral magnets. Current methods—magnetic field and electrical current controls—are inadequate for manipulation at the desired scales and speeds. MAWiCS hypothesizes that microwave frequency phonons can be harnessed to excite and control antiferromagnetic spin waves and magnetic skyrmions lattices with unprecedented efficiency. Additionally, the project predicts that magneto-acoustic interactions can induce uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, allowing for the full modulation of antiferromagnetic resonance frequencies, and that magneto-acoustic waves can propagate in topologically protected skyrmion lattice edge-states with significantly reduced magnetic damping.\n\nThe innovative experimental approaches of MAWiCS will leverage symmetry, topology, and exchange-enhancement effects to develop highly efficient control of spin dynamics. The anticipated results include the generation of nanoscale spin waves from acoustic pulses, acoustic lattice control of skyrmions, and the excitation and detection of antiferromagnetic spin waves through acoustic two-tone modulation. These breakthroughs aim to pave the way for magneto-acoustic spintronic devices, enable antiferromagnetic magnonics, and realize topological magnon transport—ushering in a new class of information technology with enhanced performance and novel functionalities. Through MAWiCS, we endeavor to overcome the existing obstacles and set the stage for significant technological advancements in the field of spintronics."

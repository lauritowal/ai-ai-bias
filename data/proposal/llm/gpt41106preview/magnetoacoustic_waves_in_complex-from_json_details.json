        "Abstract:\n\nThe quest for next-generation spintronic devices that offer ultrafast information storage and processing capabilities is at the forefront of materials science and condensed matter physics. The \"Magneto-Acoustic Waves in Complex Spin Systems\" (MAWiCS) project represents a pioneering effort to address the critical challenge of efficiently controlling magnetization in advanced materials such as ferrimagnets, antiferromagnets, and chiral magnets. Current methods—magnetic field and electrical current controls—are inadequate for manipulation at the desired scales and speeds. MAWiCS hypothesizes that microwave frequency phonons can be harnessed to excite and control antiferromagnetic spin waves and magnetic skyrmions lattices with unprecedented efficiency. Additionally, the project predicts that magneto-acoustic interactions can induce uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, allowing for the full modulation of antiferromagnetic resonance frequencies, and that magneto-acoustic waves can propagate in topologically protected skyrmion lattice edge-states with significantly reduced magnetic damping.\n\nThe innovative experimental approaches of MAWiCS will leverage symmetry, topology, and exchange-enhancement effects to develop highly efficient control of spin dynamics. The anticipated results include the generation of nanoscale spin waves from acoustic pulses, acoustic lattice control of skyrmions, and the excitation and detection of antiferromagnetic spin waves through acoustic two-tone modulation. These breakthroughs aim to pave the way for magneto-acoustic spintronic devices, enable antiferromagnetic magnonics, and realize topological magnon transport—ushering in a new class of information technology with enhanced performance and novel functionalities. Through MAWiCS, we endeavor to overcome the existing obstacles and set the stage for significant technological advancements in the field of spintronics."

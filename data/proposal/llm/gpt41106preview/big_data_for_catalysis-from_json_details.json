        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Big Data for Catalysis (BigData4Cat)\n\nThe BigData4Cat project aims to revolutionize the field of catalysis by harnessing the power of big data. Positioned at the forefront of catalysis research, with a leadership concentrated in Europe, the project seeks to address the industry's transition from reliance on oil to more sustainable resources such as gas and biomass. The role of computational techniques as the third pillar in catalysis research is pivotal in this project, which will provide a systematic approach to speed up the generation of new catalytic systems through rational design.\n\nThe core of BigData4Cat is the development of the ioChem-BD platform, which will act as a central repository for atomistic theoretical simulations data. This innovative platform will enable structured data retrieval, highlight links between data, establish data relationships, provide error bars, infer data for missing steps in reaction networks, and offer data-mining options to facilitate problem-targeted structured databases. The platform is designed to be adaptable at academic, editorial, and industrial levels, ensuring its utility across the spectrum of catalysis research.\n\nBy addressing the current issues of unstructured and unlinked data, BigData4Cat will significantly enhance the fast transference of knowledge to the chemical industry. The project's goal is to transfer computational chemistry methodology and data into research strategies, thereby empowering researchers to store, structure, and search through Catalysis Big Data in a sustainable and adaptable manner.\n\nThe proposed platform will serve as a unified solution to catalysis data challenges, fostering knowledge transfer, and supporting the industry's growing research strategies. BigData4Cat promises to be a game-changer in the field, providing the necessary tools for researchers to navigate the vast sea of data and unlock the full potential of catalysis in the modern era.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Big Data for Catalysis\" (BigData4Cat) project aims to revolutionize the field of catalysis by leveraging the power of big data and computational techniques as a third pillar in catalysis research. Europe, taking a leadership role, proposes the creation of the ioChem-BD platform, a cutting-edge tool designed to address the current challenges of unstructured and unlinked data hindering the rapid and efficient development of new catalytic systems.\n\nIn the context of a global shift from oil to cleaner sources such as gas and biomass, the chemical industry is increasingly focusing on large datasets from mechanistic studies to foster innovation. BigData4Cat will facilitate the collection, structuring, and searching of this vast amount of catalysis big data. By harnessing the platform's capabilities, including atomistic theoretical simulations, structured data retrieval, and data-mining options, researchers and industry professionals will be able to establish relationships between data points, highlight links, provide error bars, and infer missing steps in reaction networks.\n\nThe project's goal is to transfer mature computational chemistry methodologies and data into actionable strategies for research and industry, thereby accelerating the rational design of new catalytic systems. BigData4Cat will serve as a proof of concept for a sustainable method of managing catalysis big data, adaptable at academic, editorial, and industrial levels. Ultimately, the ioChem-BD platform will empower stakeholders to navigate and utilize the wealth of catalysis data more effectively, leading to accelerated innovation and knowledge transfer within the chemical industry.",

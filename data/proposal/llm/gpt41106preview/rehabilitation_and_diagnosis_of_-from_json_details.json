        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: READIHEAR: Rehabilitation and Diagnosis of Hearing Loss based on Electric Acoustic Interaction\n\nHearing loss is a pervasive condition that affects individuals across all age groups, from new-borns to the elderly. It leads to profound social and psychological impacts such as loneliness, isolation, dependence, frustration, and communication disorders. The READIHEAR project addresses this global health challenge by developing innovative diagnostic and treatment modalities through the investigation of interaction mechanisms between electric and acoustic stimulation across the auditory pathway.\n\nThe project proposes a two-fold approach: (1) to create a new generation of diagnostic devices capable of providing objective diagnostics for assessing low-frequency hearing, and (2) to develop a novel auditory prosthetic that leverages minimally invasive electric acoustic stimulation. To achieve this, we will employ cochlear implants (CIs) and study the variability in outcomes among subjects, particularly focusing on those retaining some low-frequency residual hearing.\n\nOne of the central aims of READIHEAR is to improve speech perception among the target population, which includes the elderly, new-borns, and the general population with hearing loss. We anticipate that our work will lead to significant advancements in monitoring and preserving hearing during cochlear implantation and a deeper understanding of the benefits derived from electric acoustic stimulation.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project are multifaceted, ranging from the development of state-of-the-art diagnostic tools to novel, less invasive treatment options for age-related hearing loss. The beneficiaries of this ground-breaking research will be the large and diverse group of individuals suffering from hearing loss, ultimately improving their quality of life and societal participation. Our research will provide a foundation for future innovations in the field of audiology and pave the way for improved global hearing health.\n\n(Word count: 250)"

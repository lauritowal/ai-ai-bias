        "Abstract:\n\nUnderstanding the long-term impacts of early life shocks on human capital formation is crucial for devising effective public policies. While considerable research has established that prenatal and postnatal influences significantly affect adulthood outcomes, the intervening years—termed the \"missing middle\"—remain inadequately explored. This proposed study seeks to unravel how early life shocks influence health and human capital development during the critical period from infancy through adolescence. Utilizing high-quality administrative data from Spain, spanning 35 years, this research will deploy advanced econometric techniques to analyze the effects of diverse public policies and environmental factors on child development.\n\nThe project will examine five distinct early childhood shocks, occurring at various ages, to assess their impact on material resources within the household, parental time, medical interventions at birth, family planning services, and sector-specific economic demand shocks. The consequent effects on children's health and cognitive development will be measured through hospital and primary health care records, academic performance, and standardized test scores.\n\nBy exploring a broad array of data sources, the study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of how different interventions and economic conditions shape developmental trajectories. Additionally, it will investigate potential mechanisms that mediate these effects, including changes in family size, parental labor market participation, and household spending.\n\nThis research promises to deliver critical insights into the most cost-effective strategies for enhancing young children's futures, bridging the knowledge gap in the \"missing middle.\" The findings will have direct implications for policymaking, offering evidence-based guidance for optimizing human capital development from early childhood through to adulthood."

However, we still know little about the years in between early infancy and adulthood, referred to as the “missing middle”. How do early shocks affect health and human capital formation during childhood? How do the effects of different types of interventions, or shocks at different ages, compare? What are the most cost-effective ways of improving young children’s future outcomes? I aim to fill this gap in the literature by taking advantage of a range of natural experiments in a country, Spain, for which high quality administrative data are available for the past 35 years. State of the art econometric techniques, combined with large sample sizes, will allow me to evaluate credibly and precisely the causal effects of a number of different public policies and shocks on child development. I will consider five different “shocks” in early childhood (at different ages), affecting: i) Household material resources (an unconditional mother’s allowance); ii) Parental time (subsidized paternity leave); iii) Medical treatments around birth (elective delivery); iv) The availability of family planning services (access to abortion); and v) Aggregate demand shocks to different sectors of the economy. I will evaluate their impact on health and cognitive development at ages 0-15, as measured in hospital and primary health care records, school grades, and standardized test scores, among other data sources. I will also study the potential channels linking treatments to child outcomes, including family size (fertility), parental time use and labor market outcomes, expenditure patterns, etc. My results will help us understand how shocks in early life can have long-term effects on human capital, with direct policy implications.",

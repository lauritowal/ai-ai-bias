        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"The Present Dead\" project seeks to illuminate the nuanced interplay between the living and the dead by examining the interactions with graves, human remains, and artifacts from the 5th to the 8th centuries CE in early medieval Central and Eastern Europe. The hypothesis driving this inquiry posits that these interactions varied significantly across the different ritual stages of funerals. With a focus on early medieval cemeteries characterized by individual inhumations, lavish grave goods, and evidence of post-burial disturbances, this research aims to delve into the archaeological and textual records to uncover the practical, mental, and emotional dimensions of these relationships.\n\nThe project's objectives are multi-faceted: to investigate the range of practices and contexts revealed by the archaeological record; to analyze textual evidence across a variety of genres for perspectives on death and the dead; and to synthesize these findings through semantic data integration. Methodologically, the project will consolidate existing methods, develop new research protocols to address archaeological data gaps, and innovate digital tools for transitioning from high- to low-resolution evidence.\n\nThis project stands to innovate in both its approach and its output, introducing new theoretical approaches and technical solutions to perennial challenges in the field. The development of digital tools for evidence resolution will particularly aid in integrating diverse data sources, enhancing the reliability and depth of our historical understanding. Ultimately, \"The Present Dead\" will significantly advance knowledge of early medieval Europe's cultural and social history by offering fresh insights into the complex dynamics between the living and the dead."

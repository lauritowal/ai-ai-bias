        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The Present Dead: Investigating Interactions with the Dead in Early Medieval Central and Eastern Europe from 5th to 8th Centuries CE,\" aims to illuminate the multifaceted relationship between the living and the dead during a pivotal era in European history. Spanning the 5th to 8th centuries CE, the project focuses on Central and Eastern Europe, regions rich in archaeological and textual evidence of early medieval funerary practices. The core hypothesis is that perspectives on and interactions with the materials of the dead—graves, human remains, and associated artifacts—varied according to the ritual stages of funerals.\n\nThis interdisciplinary research will delve into the practical, mental, and emotional dimensions of these interactions, examining up to hundreds of inhumed graves, often accompanied by lavish objects and showing signs of post-burial interference. The project will employ a combination of scientific methods, technical solutions, and new theoretical approaches to investigate a range of practices and contexts reflected in the archaeological records. Textual perspectives from diverse genres will be analyzed to complement the findings from the physical evidence.\n\nThe project's innovative contribution lies in the development of digital tools designed for semantic integration of data, facilitating the synthesis of material and textual perspectives. This technical solution will bridge the gap between high- and low-resolution evidence, enhancing our understanding of early medieval practices relating to the dead. Methodological objectives include the consolidation of research protocols and strategies to address archaeological data deficiencies.\n\nBy providing a comprehensive understanding of the interactions with the dead, \"The Present Dead\" will significantly advance our knowledge of early medieval Europe's social and cultural dynamics, offering new insights into the complex relationship between the living and the dead during this transformative period.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The Present Dead: Investigating Interactions with the Dead in Early Medieval Central and Eastern Europe from 5th to 8th Centuries CE,\" seeks to explore the multifaceted relationships between the living and the dead in early medieval Europe. Delving into the 5th to 8th centuries CE, this research will focus on Central and Eastern European practices as evidenced by graves, human remains, and artifacts.\n\nCentral to the study is the hypothesis that interactions with the materials of the dead vary significantly across different stages of funeral rituals. To test this, the project will analyze a broad range of archaeological records, including cemeteries characterized by individual inhumation, lavish grave goods, and evident post-burial interventions, which are crucial to understanding early medieval mortuary practices.\n\nThe methodological approach integrates scientific methods, technical solutions, and new theoretical frameworks. A significant innovation of this project is the development of digital tools designed to facilitate the semantic integration of high- to low-resolution evidence from both archaeological and textual sources. Objectives include the investigation of mortuary contexts, analysis of textual evidence across various genres, and synthesis of these materials to form a coherent picture of early medieval attitudes toward the dead.\n\nBy consolidating methodologies and developing research protocols to address archaeological data deficiencies, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the practical, mental, and emotional dimensions of human interactions with the dead. Ultimately, \"The Present Dead\" will offer a significant contribution to our knowledge of the complex relationship between the living and the dead in early medieval Europe, enriching our historical and cultural perspectives on this transformative era.",
        "Abstract:\n\n\"The Present Dead: Investigating Interactions with the Dead in Early Medieval Central and Eastern Europe from 5th to 8th Centuries CE\" is a pioneering research initiative aimed at decoding the multifaceted relationships between the living and the dead during a transformative epoch in central and eastern Europe. Through an interdisciplinary examination of graves, human remains, and associated artefacts from the 5th to the 8th centuries CE, this project seeks to illuminate the practical, mental, and emotional dimensions underpinning early medieval mortuary practices.\n\nGrounded in a robust methodological framework that integrates scientific methods, technical solutions, and novel theoretical approaches, the study hypothesizes that the nature of interactions with the dead varied with the stages of funeral rituals. The research will scrutinize a rich tapestry of archaeological and textual evidence, focusing on characteristics of early medieval cemeteries—such as individual inhumations with lavish grave goods and evidence of post-burial interference—to reveal patterns of grave interventions and their cultural significance.\n\nCentral to this inquiry are the research objectives to investigate the range of practices discernible in the archaeological records, analyze textual perspectives across literary genres, and synthesize these insights through the development of cutting-edge digital tools designed for semantic data integration. This will enable a transition from high- to low-resolution evidence, thereby addressing the inherent deficiencies in archaeological data.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of \"The Present Dead\" is to substantially advance our understanding of the complex and evolving interaction between the living and the dead in early medieval Europe. By shedding light on these ancient practices, the project promises to offer a fresh and nuanced perspective on the cultural dynamics of this historical period, revealing how the dead continued to shape the world of the living long after their passing.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"The Present Dead\" project seeks to illuminate the nuanced interplay between the living and the dead by examining the interactions with graves, human remains, and artifacts from the 5th to the 8th centuries CE in early medieval Central and Eastern Europe. The hypothesis driving this inquiry posits that these interactions varied significantly across the different ritual stages of funerals. With a focus on early medieval cemeteries characterized by individual inhumations, lavish grave goods, and evidence of post-burial disturbances, this research aims to delve into the archaeological and textual records to uncover the practical, mental, and emotional dimensions of these relationships.\n\nThe project's objectives are multi-faceted: to investigate the range of practices and contexts revealed by the archaeological record; to analyze textual evidence across a variety of genres for perspectives on death and the dead; and to synthesize these findings through semantic data integration. Methodologically, the project will consolidate existing methods, develop new research protocols to address archaeological data gaps, and innovate digital tools for transitioning from high- to low-resolution evidence.\n\nThis project stands to innovate in both its approach and its output, introducing new theoretical approaches and technical solutions to perennial challenges in the field. The development of digital tools for evidence resolution will particularly aid in integrating diverse data sources, enhancing the reliability and depth of our historical understanding. Ultimately, \"The Present Dead\" will significantly advance knowledge of early medieval Europe's cultural and social history by offering fresh insights into the complex dynamics between the living and the dead."

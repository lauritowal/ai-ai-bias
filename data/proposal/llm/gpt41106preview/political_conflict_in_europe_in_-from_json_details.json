        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"Political Conflict in Europe in the Shadow of the Great Recession\" aims to dissect the evolution of political conflict in European democracies and the politicization of the European integration process against the backdrop of the economic turbulence initiated in the fall of 2008. The central objective is to assess whether the Great Recession has been a catalyst for altering long-standing political conflict trends in Europe, and to understand the implications of these changes for the future of democracy in the region.\n\nA comprehensive comparative-static and dynamic analysis will be employed to explore political mobilization in national elections, the protest arena, and the public interactions between political authorities and challengers. The study will encompass a broad geographical scope, including Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern European countries, with a focus on events before and after 2008. The unit of analysis will be chains of events in different arenas, providing a novel approach to examining interconnected political activities.\n\nThe proposed project is poised to offer significant theoretical innovations by linking the study of elections to political protest and adopting dynamic, process-oriented analyses. Embracing empirical innovations, the project will extend the scope of previous work in both time and space, introduce a new type of unit of analysis, and develop semi-automated tools for media content analyses.\n\nKey expected outcomes include the identification of a potential renaissance of nationalism, an increase in the coupling of electoral and protest politics, and the restructuring of national political conflict structures. Ultimately, the project seeks to uncover whether populist challengers are flourishing under crisis conditions, posing a serious threat to the democratic fabric of European societies. This study will provide policymakers and scholars with a deeper understanding of the relationship between economic crises and political conflict, enabling the development of more informed responses to future challenges.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Political Conflict in Europe in the Shadow of the Great Recession\n\nThe POLCON project aims to conduct a comprehensive study on the evolution of political conflict in European democracies and the politicization of the European integration process, against the backdrop of the Great Recession. With the onset of economic crisis in Fall 2008, this research seeks to assess whether the Great Recession has modified long-standing trends in political conflict and poses a potential threat to democratic structures.\n\nThe project will employ a comparative-static and dynamic analysis focusing on political mobilization within national elections, the protest arena, and public interactions between political authorities and challengers. Through a novel approach that links the study of elections to political protest, it will provide dynamic and process-oriented analyses of political conflict.\n\nThe research will cover an extensive geographical scope, including Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe. It will innovatively extend the scope of previous work both temporally (before and after 2008) and spatially, introducing a new type of unit of analysis—chains of events in different arenas—and utilizing semi-automated tools for media content analyses.\n\nThe project anticipates several outcomes, including a potential flourishing of populist challengers, a renaissance of nationalism, a tighter coupling of electoral and protest politics, and a fundamental restructuring of national political conflict structures, all of which could have significant implications for the understanding of European political dynamics in times of crisis.\n\nPOLCON not only seeks to generate theoretical and empirical innovations but also aims to shed light on the key question: To what extent has the Great Recession impacted long-term trends in political conflict in Europe, and what implications does this have for the robustness of democracy in the region?",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Political Conflict in Europe in the Shadow of the Great Recession,\" aims to scrutinize the evolution of political conflict within European democracies and the intensifying politicization of the European integration process amidst the economic turmoil initiated in the fall of 2008. By leveraging a comparative-static and dynamic analysis, this study will dissect the political mobilization observable in national elections, protest arenas, and public interactions between political authorities and their challengers. The research will consider the pre- and post-2008 periods, providing a comprehensive examination of the long-standing political conflict trends and their potential transformation due to the Great Recession.\n\nThe geographical scope encompasses diverse political landscapes, including Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, fostering an extensive understanding of the phenomena across varying contexts. The project introduces innovative methodologies and theoretical frameworks, such as linking the study of elections to political protest and implementing a process-oriented analysis. Empirical innovations include an extended temporal and spatial scope, a novel unit of analysis focusing on event chains, and the application of semi-automated tools for media content analyses.\n\nKey questions to be explored involve the impact of the Great Recession on the long-term trends of political conflict in Europe and the consequent threats posed to democratic structures. The expected outcomes include the flourishing of populist challengers, a potential renaissance of nationalism, a tighter coupling of electoral and protest politics, and a fundamental restructuring of national political conflict structures. Ultimately, the project seeks to assess whether the Great Recession is altering the trajectory of political conflicts in Europe and the implications for the future of European democracy.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Political Conflict in Europe in the Shadow of the Great Recession,\" aims to investigate the transformation of political conflict within European democracies and the heightened politicization of European integration in response to the economic turmoil following the Great Recession of 2008. Recognizing the pivotal role this period has played in shaping contemporary political dynamics, the project seeks to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis focusing on political mobilization in national elections, the protest arena, and public interactions between political authorities and their challengers. The research will assess whether the Great Recession has significantly altered long-standing trends in political conflict across Europe and explore whether these shifts pose a credible threat to democratic stability.\n\nThe study will encompass an expansive geographical scope, including Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, and will compare developments before and after the economic crisis onset in Fall 2008. The unit of analysis will be chains of events across different arenas, utilizing both comparative-static and dynamic methodologies. In pursuing theoretical innovations, the project will for the first time link the study of elections with political protest through dynamic and process-oriented analyses.\n\nEmpirical innovations are central to this proposal, with plans to extend the scope of previous work both temporally and spatially, introduce a new type of unit of analysis for event chains, and employ semi-automated tools for media content analyses. The expected outcomes of the study include the flourishing of populist challengers under crisis conditions, a potential renaissance of nationalism, a tighter coupling of electoral and protest politics, and a fundamental restructuring of national political conflict structures.\n\nUltimately, this project will provide invaluable insights into the evolution of political conflict in the context of economic crisis and its implications for the future of European democracies."

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Political Conflict in Europe in the Shadow of the Great Recession,\" aims to investigate the transformation of political conflict within European democracies and the heightened politicization of European integration in response to the economic turmoil following the Great Recession of 2008. Recognizing the pivotal role this period has played in shaping contemporary political dynamics, the project seeks to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis focusing on political mobilization in national elections, the protest arena, and public interactions between political authorities and their challengers. The research will assess whether the Great Recession has significantly altered long-standing trends in political conflict across Europe and explore whether these shifts pose a credible threat to democratic stability.\n\nThe study will encompass an expansive geographical scope, including Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, and will compare developments before and after the economic crisis onset in Fall 2008. The unit of analysis will be chains of events across different arenas, utilizing both comparative-static and dynamic methodologies. In pursuing theoretical innovations, the project will for the first time link the study of elections with political protest through dynamic and process-oriented analyses.\n\nEmpirical innovations are central to this proposal, with plans to extend the scope of previous work both temporally and spatially, introduce a new type of unit of analysis for event chains, and employ semi-automated tools for media content analyses. The expected outcomes of the study include the flourishing of populist challengers under crisis conditions, a potential renaissance of nationalism, a tighter coupling of electoral and protest politics, and a fundamental restructuring of national political conflict structures.\n\nUltimately, this project will provide invaluable insights into the evolution of political conflict in the context of economic crisis and its implications for the future of European democracies."

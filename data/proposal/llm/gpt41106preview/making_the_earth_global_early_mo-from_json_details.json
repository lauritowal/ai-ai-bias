        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Making the Earth Global: Early Modern Nautical Rutters and the Construction of a Global Concept of the Earth\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the transformation of the Earth's conception from a fragmented world to a global entity through the systematic study of early modern nautical rutters and ship's logbooks. These documents, considered the earliest Western sources to detail global oceanic traversal, encapsulate a wealth of nautical information, oceanographic data, meteorological observations, geographical knowledge, geophysical phenomena, and descriptions of the natural world. The project aims to narrate the scaling up of a scientific description of the Earth in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a pivotal period during which a planetary-scale understanding of the Earth began to emerge.\n\nThe research activities will involve a meticulous search, identification, and classification of information within Iberian rutters and logbooks, employing a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach. By analyzing these peerless historical documents, the project will provide an improved understanding of how global concepts of the Earth were formed, documenting the early modern roots of our present-day global consciousness.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is to deliver a narrative that captures the historical process leading to the formation of global earth concepts, thus contributing significantly to the fields of history, geography, and maritime studies. As such, the project promises to offer unique insights into the construction of our collective global identity and the ways in which knowledge of the world's interconnectedness developed through early modern seafaring experiences.\n\nKeywords: Nautical rutters, Global concepts, Early modern period, Scientific description, Multidisciplinary study, Historical documentation"

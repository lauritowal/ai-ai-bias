        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Making the Earth Global: Early Modern Nautical Rutters and the Construction of a Global Concept of the Earth\" seeks to explore the rich history encapsulated in early modern nautical documents. Through a comprehensive examination of nautical rutters and ship's logbooks from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, this research aims to write a historical narrative that captures the scaling up of scientific descriptions of the earth. These documents represent some of the earliest Western efforts to comprehend and describe the world at a global, planetary scale. They contain invaluable information categories such as courses, distances, latitudes, ocean currents, tides, meteorological patterns, and geography, including the study of magnetic declination and aspects of the natural world.\n\nThe project objectives include a systematic search, identification, and classification of information within Iberian rutters and logbooks, employing an extensive multidisciplinary approach. By doing so, the project will illuminate how global concepts about the earth were documented and evolved during this pivotal period. The expected outcome is an improved understanding of the historical process leading to the formation of global earth concepts, which has peerless historical value.\n\nThe geographical focus of the study is global, aiming to articulate the emergence of a planetary scale experience and the construction of a global understanding of the earth. This project promises to contribute significantly to the knowledge of early modern oceanic exploration and the intellectual history of globalism.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Making the Earth Global: Early Modern Nautical Rutters and the Construction of a Global Concept of the Earth\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to launch a groundbreaking historical analysis titled \"Making the Earth Global,\" which will explore the role of early modern nautical rutters and ship's logbooks in shaping the first Western concepts of the earth on a global, planetary scale. These documents, regarded as the earliest Western sources to document oceanic traversal comprehensively, contain invaluable information ranging from nautical courses, distances, and latitudes, to oceanography, meteorology, geography, geophysics, and observations of the natural world.\n\nThe primary objective of this research is to construct a narrative detailing how scientific descriptions of the earth were scaled up during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This will be achieved through a systematic search, identification, and classification of information contained within early modern Iberian rutters and ship’s logbooks. The project promises to be a multidisciplinary study, drawing on methods from history, geography, oceanography, and other relevant fields.\n\nThe significance of the project lies in its potential to illuminate the historical process through which global concepts of the earth were formed. By providing a peerless look into how these early documents contributed to the understanding of the world on a planetary scale, the project aims to significantly enhance our knowledge of the emergence and evolution of global earth concepts. This research will not only fill a critical gap in historical knowledge but will also serve as a rich resource for scholars across various disciplines interested in the development of global awareness and scientific thought.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Making the Earth Global: Early Modern Nautical Rutters and the Construction of a Global Concept of the Earth\n\nThe proposed research project endeavors to explore how a global concept of the Earth emerged during the early modern period through the meticulous examination of nautical rutters and ship's logbooks. These archival documents represent some of the earliest Western attempts to document oceanic traversal on a planetary scale. The project's main objective is to craft a comprehensive narrative that traces the scaling up of scientific descriptions of the Earth during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\nRutters and logbooks of this era contain an abundance of nautical information, such as courses, distances, and latitudes, coupled with data pertaining to oceanography, meteorology, geography, geophysics, and the natural world. By systematically searching, identifying, and classifying this information from early modern Iberian sources, the project will provide unparalleled insights into the historical process of formulating global earth concepts.\n\nThe multidisciplinary approach of this study will integrate perspectives from history, geography, oceanography, and other relevant fields to offer a unique historical value. The project aims to enhance our understanding of how early modern seafarers contributed significantly to the construction of a global understanding of the Earth.\n\nExpected outcomes include a significant contribution to the scholarship of early modern history and navigation, improved knowledge of how global paradigms were formed, and an appreciation for the peerless historical value of these documents in documenting the emergence of global earth concepts.\n\nKeywords: nautical rutters, ship's logbooks, global concept, Earth, early modern, multidisciplinary study.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Making the Earth Global: Early Modern Nautical Rutters and the Construction of a Global Concept of the Earth\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the transformation of the Earth's conception from a fragmented world to a global entity through the systematic study of early modern nautical rutters and ship's logbooks. These documents, considered the earliest Western sources to detail global oceanic traversal, encapsulate a wealth of nautical information, oceanographic data, meteorological observations, geographical knowledge, geophysical phenomena, and descriptions of the natural world. The project aims to narrate the scaling up of a scientific description of the Earth in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a pivotal period during which a planetary-scale understanding of the Earth began to emerge.\n\nThe research activities will involve a meticulous search, identification, and classification of information within Iberian rutters and logbooks, employing a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach. By analyzing these peerless historical documents, the project will provide an improved understanding of how global concepts of the Earth were formed, documenting the early modern roots of our present-day global consciousness.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is to deliver a narrative that captures the historical process leading to the formation of global earth concepts, thus contributing significantly to the fields of history, geography, and maritime studies. As such, the project promises to offer unique insights into the construction of our collective global identity and the ways in which knowledge of the world's interconnectedness developed through early modern seafaring experiences.\n\nKeywords: Nautical rutters, Global concepts, Early modern period, Scientific description, Multidisciplinary study, Historical documentation"

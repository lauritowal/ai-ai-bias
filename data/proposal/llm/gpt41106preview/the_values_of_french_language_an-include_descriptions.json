        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal addresses two pivotal inquiries concerning linguistic identity within the European context: the historical interplay between language and identity, and the differentiation of cognate languages. Emphasizing the postulate that normative models of national languages have been instrumental in shaping European identity, the proposal scrutinizes how these models, dominant from the 19th century, were retrofitted onto a preexisting multilingual tapestry, marked by fluidity rather than rigidity. Central to this investigation is the period from 1100 to 1450, a time when multilingualism was the norm and languages such as Latin and French transcended local usage.\n\nThe proposed project reevaluates the significance of French, not solely in terms of its cultural cache but as a supralocal and transnational medium of communication, especially pertinent in Western Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. By examining 'L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César', a textual tradition integral to medieval conceptions of European history and identity, the project aims to invigorate a broader, speculative dialogue on linguistic identity.\n\nThis interdisciplinary endeavor unites scholars from various European nations and North America, employing diverse methodologies from fields such as codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology. The collaborative approach ensures that the research transcends intellectual and national academic boundaries, offering fresh, international insights.\n\nThe project aspires to move beyond existing critiques of national languages and literary traditions, encompassing a wide historical spectrum. Its ultimate objective is to reassess the function of French as a lingua franca and to question its influence on the formation of a European identity during the medieval era. This innovative analysis is poised to contribute significantly to our understanding of the nexus between language and identity in the fabric of European history."

What is the relation historically between language and identity in Europe? How are cognate languages demarcated from each other? Normative models of national languages helped shape Europe. Yet they did not become hegemonic until the 19th century. Indeed, they were imposed (not always successfully) on a linguistic map of Europe more fluid and complex than most histories of national languages allow. In the Middle Ages multilingualism was common, as was the use of non-local languages, notably Latin, but also French. This project undertakes a revaluation of the nature and value of the use of French in Europe during a crucial period, 1100-1450, less in terms of its cultural prestige (the traditional focus of scholarship) than of its role as a supralocal, transnational language, particularly in Western Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The project fosters collaboration between, and cuts across, different intellectual and national scholarly traditions, drawing on expertise in codicology, critical theory, linguistics, literature, and philology; it involves scholars from a range of European countries and North America, entailing empirical research around a complex and widely disseminated textual tradition vital to medieval understandings of European history and identity, L’Histoire ancienne jusqu’à César. This case study will ground and stimulate broader speculative reflection on the two core questions concerning linguistic identity. While the project builds on prior critiques of the construction of, and investment in, national languages and literary traditions, it has a broad historical scope, and will offer an innovative, genuinely international perspective, in terms of both its object of study and method. Indeed, its final aim, through and beyond its consideration of French as a lingua franca, is to interrogate that language’s role in the emergence of a European identity in the Middle Ages.",

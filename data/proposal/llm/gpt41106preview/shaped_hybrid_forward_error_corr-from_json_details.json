        "Abstract:\n\nThe rapid expansion of data-intensive applications necessitates the development of high-performance, high-speed, and energy-efficient communication systems. Current state-of-the-art Forward Error Correction (FEC) solutions, primarily implemented using Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) techniques, have reached a plateau in terms of performance and energy efficiency, which significantly impacts the telecommunication industry, including designers, device manufacturers, and system integrators. This proposal introduces the \"Shaped Hybrid Forward Error Correction\" (SHY-FEC) as an innovative solution to this challenge.\n\nSHY-FEC promises to address the high energy consumption and complexity issues associated with existing FEC techniques by combining hybrid channel coding with low-complexity constellation shaping. This innovative approach is anticipated to deliver performance levels akin to those of soft-decision FEC while achieving at least one order of magnitude lower in energy consumption. Such advancements are crucial as the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector currently accounts for 5-9% of the world's total electricity use, with FEC energy consumption alone comprising 15% of receiver energy in connectivity systems.\n\nThe proposed SHY-FEC algorithm aims to benefit a wide range of applications, including wireless systems and short/medium-haul fiber optics. The project will undergo phases of technology feasibility and pre-commercialization activities. This transformative technology not only holds the potential to alleviate the distress in the telecommunication network value chain but also contributes significantly towards reducing the environmental impact by lowering the ICT sector's energy footprint.\n\nThe proposed SHY-FEC is poised to serve as a paradigm shift in FEC technology, offering a scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative for next-generation communication networks."

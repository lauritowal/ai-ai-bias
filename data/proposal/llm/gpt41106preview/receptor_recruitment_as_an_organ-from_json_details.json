        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Receptor Recruitment as an Organizational Principle for Self-Assembling Matter\" aims to revolutionize the construction of self-assembled materials by employing the concept of receptor recruitment—a strategy inspired by biological systems—for the precise organization of building blocks into well-defined architectures. This innovative approach leverages multivalent interactions to control stoichiometry and structure, enabling the creation of platforms with specific nanoscale dimensions and molecular functionalities. These platforms are designed to facilitate the identification, sensing, and isolation of biological particles, such as viruses and extracellular vesicles, thus offering potential 'fingerprints' for these entities. \n\nOur methodology includes the development of high-throughput screening techniques to explore virus–glycan combinations, the implementation of functional and fluorescent groups for enhanced detection capabilities, and the establishment of fixation processes to ensure the stability and permanence of the assembled structures. The anticipated outcomes of the project include a deeper understanding of multivalent interactions and recruitment processes, as well as the generation of stable building blocks that can be applied to the creation of advanced biomedical platforms and smart materials.\n\nBy mirroring nature's own methods of receptor recruitment, we anticipate developing novel nanoscale tools for single-particle sensing and particle isolation, addressing current challenges in the quick and accurate sensing of biological particles. The project's success will contribute significantly to the fields of biomimicry, material science, and biotechnology, with far-reaching implications for both health-related and environmental applications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Receptor Recruitment as an Organizational Principle for Self-Assembling Matter,\" seeks to revolutionize the field of material science by employing the concept of receptor recruitment for the self-assembly of building blocks into precise architectures. Drawing inspiration from nature's biomimetic receptor recruitment processes, our objective is to achieve unprecedented control over the stoichiometry and structural integrity of self-assembled materials. Through the utilization of key techniques such as multivalent interactions and high-throughput methods, coupled with follow-up fixation processes and the incorporation of functional, including fluorescent, groups, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of the underlying multivalent interactions.\n\nThe project's innovative approach will lead to the creation of stable, nanoscale platforms imbued with molecular functionalities, which are essential in the identification, sensing, and isolation of biological particles, particularly virus particles and extracellular vesicles. High-throughput screening of virus–glycan combinations will enable us not only to generate 'fingerprints' for various viruses but also to offer single-particle sensing capabilities, thereby advancing particle isolation techniques.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly impact biomedical platforms and the development of smart materials. By providing a detailed insight into receptor recruitment and self-assembly processes, this project aims to tackle challenges in the fields of biosensing and the isolation of biological particles, ultimately contributing to the progress in the screening and diagnostic capacities within the healthcare industry. The successful implementation of this project promises to deliver cutting-edge applications that could transform current approaches to material design and disease management.",

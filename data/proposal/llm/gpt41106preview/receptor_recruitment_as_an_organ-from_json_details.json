        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Receptor Recruitment as an Organizational Principle for Self-Assembling Matter,\" aims to exploit the natural phenomenon of receptor recruitment to pioneer the construction of self-assembled architectures from building blocks with precise stoichiometry and structure. Drawing inspiration from biological systems, this research will focus on the utilization of multivalent interactions and follow-up fixation processes to form stable and functional assemblies at the nanoscale.\n\nOur objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of receptor recruitment and multivalent interactions that govern self-assembly processes. By integrating functional and fluorescent groups into the design, we will create platforms capable of identifying, sensing, and isolating biological particles such as viruses and extracellular vesicles. The use of high-throughput screening methods will facilitate the evaluation of virus–glycan combinations, contributing to the generation of unique virus 'fingerprints' that can aid in rapid identification and isolation.\n\nThe project promises innovations in the form of nanoscale platforms endowed with molecular functionalities. These advances have the potential to revolutionize biomedical platforms and the development of smart materials. By achieving control over the self-assembly of matter, we anticipate creating tools for single-particle sensing and particle isolation with significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.\n\nThis grant proposal seeks support for the research that merges principles of biomimicry with cutting-edge science and technology to address challenges in the identification, sensing, and isolation of biological particles, ultimately contributing to the fields of materials science and biomedicine."

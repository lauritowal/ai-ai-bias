        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Importance of Cellular Sex in Physiology and the Underlying Mechanisms\n\nThis grant proposal presents a comprehensive research project aimed at unraveling the fundamental role of cellular sex in physiology and disease processes. Leveraging the Drosophila model organism, we propose to investigate the distinct phenotypic dimorphism attributed to sex differences that manifest in risk, incidence, and response to diseases. Our approach will characterize new cellular sex pathways that drive sex differences in body size and behaviors, study the role of sex determinant coding changes in the evolution of sex traits, and achieve organ-specific Y chromosome deletion to elucidate the Y chromosome's influence over the sex gap in longevity.\n\nOur objectives are threefold: (1) to characterize new cellular sex pathways driving sex differences; (2) to study the impact of sex determinant coding changes on sex trait evolution; and (3) to perform targeted Y chromosome deletion in specific organs to understand its control over the longevity sex gap. The research will incorporate a blend of classical fly genetics, novel genetic methods, and cutting-edge genomic techniques to generate mosaic animals with genetically manipulated sex chromosomes.\n\nThe anticipated impact of our research is significant, providing an enhanced understanding of the importance of cellular sex in physiology and disease. This knowledge has the potential to influence future therapeutic strategies and contribute to precision medicine, where treatments can be tailored based on an individual's sex at a cellular level. Our findings will also address critical research gaps concerning the phenotypic consequences of sex differences, the influence of somatic cells, the identification of critical genes and mechanisms, and the elucidation of the sites of cellular sex action.\n\nThe project holds the promise of major breakthroughs in our comprehension of cell-intrinsic mechanisms involving sex chromosomes and the sex-specific predisposition to tumors in intestinal stem cells, among other phenomena. By exploring these uncharted territories, we aim to pave the way for novel insights into the intricate interplay between cellular sex and overall organismal health."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Targeting the dark side of the human genome—non-coding regulatory elements—to treat diseases\" project proposes an innovative approach to medical therapeutics by focusing on the largely unexplored non-coding regulatory elements (NCREs) that comprise 98% of our genome. Although these regions do not encode proteins, they play a crucial role in gene expression and are implicated in numerous diseases due to genetic variants. However, the potential of NCREs as therapeutic targets has not been fully realized due to technical limitations.\n\nThis project, developed under the auspices of an ECR starting grant named \"Silencer,\" aims to overcome these hurdles by implementing two novel high-throughput screening systems to identify and validate NCREs that can be modulated for therapeutic purposes. The project will test and validate the top hits in vivo, conduct pilot research to prove the technology's effectiveness for commercial applications, clarify IPR protection strategies, and engage with partners and stakeholders to prepare for market entry.\n\nBy unlocking the therapeutic values of NCREs, the project promises to open new avenues for treating diseases, with significant innovation and commercial potential. The ultimate goal is to establish a pipeline of NCRE-based treatments that will improve patient outcomes and contribute to the advancement of precision medicine."

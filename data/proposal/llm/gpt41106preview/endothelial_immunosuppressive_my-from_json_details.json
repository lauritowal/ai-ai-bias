        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Endothelial immunosuppressive mystery genes for alternative immunotherapy: artificial intelligence-driven target discovery and lipid nanoparticle/RNA-based target validation,\" seeks to revolutionize the field of immunotherapy by exploring the largely uncharted immunomodulatory gene signatures of endothelial cells (ECs), specifically a subtype known as IMECs. This initiative aims to improve the efficacy of anti-cancer immunotherapy and overcome resistance presented by the immunosuppressive tumor endothelium.\n\nAddressing the significant gap in our understanding, 30% of human coding genes remain poorly annotated for their function in the vascular biology context. This proposal endeavors to demystify these unknown 'mystery genes' utilizing the novel AI-based tool, SCMYSTERYDENTIFIER, designed to predict new immunosuppressive functions. Complementing this is the advanced validation technology, REVOLT, which uses EC-selective lipid nanoparticles to deliver sgRNA, creating EC-specific knockout mice rapidly and cost-effectively, at an unprecedented scale.\n\nThe project sets ambitious goals to validate 50 targets and identify and patent at least 5 new targets that are previously unknown for IMEC-based immunotherapy. With a clear societal impact focus, the outcomes promise not only a substantial knowledge gain in the domain of vascular biology but also the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. The proposal outlines the potential of SCMYSTERYDENTIFIER for generic use and REVOLT to accelerate the pace of genetic research, offering significant benefits to both academic and pharmaceutical communities.\n\nIn essence, this proposal presents a divergent and ambitious approach to the current research landscape, with the potential to yield groundbreaking discoveries in immunotherapy and establish new paradigms in the treatment of cancer.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Endothelial immunosuppressive mystery genes for alternative immunotherapy: artificial intelligence-driven target discovery and lipid nanoparticle/RNA-based target validation\" aims to revolutionize the understanding and treatment of cancer by targeting immunosuppressive genes within endothelial cells (ECs), specifically within a subtype known as IMECs. This proposal distinguishes itself through its novel focus, heightened ambition, and potential for significant societal impact compared to previous grants.\n\nApproximately 30% of the human coding genome, comprising 'mystery genes' with uncharacterized functions, holds immense therapeutic potential, particularly for improving anti-cancer immunotherapy efficacy and overcoming resistance presented by the immunosuppressive tumor endothelium. Our research will employ an innovative AI-based tool, 'SCMYSTERYDENTIFIER', to predict new immunosuppressive functions for these enigmatic genes. In parallel, we will develop 'REVOLT', a groundbreaking validation technology deploying EC-selective lipid nanoparticles with sgRNA, enabling us to rapidly and cost-effectively generate EC-specific knockout mice at an unprecedented scale, with a cost of just 300€ per mouse.\n\nThe goals of our project include the validation of 50 target genes and the identification and potential patenting of 5 novel targets. These efforts are expected to yield significant knowledge gains and propel therapy development. Additionally, the generic applicability of 'SCMYSTERYDENTIFIER' and the transformative impact of 'REVOLT' are set to accelerate the pace of genetic research in vascular biology, benefiting both the academic and pharmaceutical communities.\n\nIn summary, demystifying the mystery genome through this project offers formidable opportunities for advancing knowledge and developing innovative therapies in the fight against cancer.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Endothelial Immunomodulatory Mystery Genes for Alternative Immunotherapy: Artificial Intelligence-Driven Target Discovery and Lipid Nanoparticle/RNA-Based Target Validation,\" aims to revolutionize the field of immunotherapy by exploring the uncharted territory of immunosuppressive genes within endothelial cells (ECs), specifically a subtype referred to as IMECs. With an ambition to significantly impact society by advancing alternative immunotherapy development, this proposal stands apart in topic, ambition, and societal focus compared to previous grants.\n\nOur innovative approach entails deploying an artificial intelligence tool, SCMYSTERYDENTIFIER, designed to predict new immunosuppressive functions within the 30% of the human coding genome that lacks functional annotation, specifically focusing on mystery genes relevant to IMEC-based immunotherapy. The project also introduces a state-of-the-art validation technology, REVOLT, which harnesses lipid nanoparticles containing sgRNA for EC-selective delivery, allowing for the rapid and cost-efficient generation of EC-specific knockout mice at just 300 EUR per specimen.\n\nThe project's goals are ambitious yet attainable: to validate 50 immunosuppressive targets and identify and patent at least 5 novel targets. SCMYSTERYDENTIFIER has potential for generic use beyond this project, while REVOLT is expected to accelerate the pace of genetic research in vascular biology, benefiting both academia and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nIn summary, demystifying the mystery genome harbored by endothelial cells holds the promise of not only expanding our knowledge but also developing new therapeutic strategies that could improve the efficacy of anticancer immunotherapy and overcome resistance mechanisms associated with the immunosuppressive tumor endothelium. The success of this project could lead to groundbreaking advancements in the treatment of various diseases where the immune system plays a critical role.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Endothelial immunosuppressive mystery genes for alternative immunotherapy: artificial intelligence-driven target discovery and lipid nanoparticle/RNA-based target validation\n\nThe proposed project aims to revolutionize the field of alternative immunotherapy by identifying and validating new targets within the immunomodulatory gene signatures of endothelial cells. Although 30% of the human coding genome remains poorly annotated, this initiative focuses specifically on the endothelial cell subtype, known for its immunosuppressive properties within the tumor microenvironment. To address this challenge, we introduce two innovative tools: SCMYSTERYDENTIFIER, an AI-based platform designed to predict immunosuppressive functions for uncharacterized endothelial genes, and REVOLT, a technology enabling rapid, cost-effective generation of endothelial cell-specific knockout mice through EC-selective lipid nanoparticles carrying sgRNA.\n\nOur ambitious objectives include the validation of 50 targets and the identification and patenting of 5 novel targets, which are critical for endothelial cell-mediated immunosuppression. With an estimated cost of 300€ per knockout mouse model, our approach not only promises to improve the efficacy of anti-cancer immunotherapies and overcome resistance but also sets a new precedent in terms of speed and affordability.\n\nThe project stands out from previous grants in its unique focus, ambitious scope, and profound societal impact. It is poised to deliver significant knowledge gains in the field of immunotherapy and provide the research community, including academia and pharma, with powerful tools to accelerate the pace of genetic research in vascular biology. The overarching vision is to demystify the mystery genome, unlocking formidable opportunities for both knowledge enhancement and therapeutic advancements."

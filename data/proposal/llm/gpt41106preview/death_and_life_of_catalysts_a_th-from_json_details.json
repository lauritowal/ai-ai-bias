        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Death and Life of Catalysts: a Theory-Guided Unified Approach for Non-Critical Metal Catalyst Development\" (DeLiCAT) project presents an innovative strategy to revolutionize the field of catalysis. By integrating advanced chemical theories with computational and experimental methods, DeLiCAT aims to design novel catalyst systems that are not reliant on critical metals. These catalysts will be more durable, cost-effective, and efficient for crucial reactions such as the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids and their esters, as well as acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols.\n\nThe objectives of DeLiCAT are to establish a hierarchical computational strategy for the design and synthesis of these new catalysts, and to develop sustainable chemical transformations that leverage non-critical metal resources. By employing a combination of chemical theory, computational screening, and experimental approaches spanning both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, DeLiCAT will facilitate an efficient knowledge exchange loop, ensuring that theoretical predictions are continuously refined and validated through empirical studies.\n\nComputer simulations will play a critical role in revealing complex reaction networks, directing selectivity, and preventing catalyst deactivation. The project will lead to the creation of multifunctional catalyst systems that are specifically engineered to drive desired reactions while resisting decay. The expected outcomes include the development of new theoretical concepts, methodological advances in catalyst design, and the synthesis of superior catalyst systems suitable for liquid phase chemical transformations.\n\nDeLiCAT's impact will be felt across multiple fields of application, including biomass valorization, catalysis, and hydrogen technology, making it a significant contributor to sustainable industrial processes. This unified, first-principles-guided approach promises to set a new standard for catalyst development, with the potential to deliver both environmental and economic benefits."

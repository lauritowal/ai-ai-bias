        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Smart-Contract Protocols: Theory for Applications\n\nSmart contracts represent a groundbreaking innovation in the domain of digital agreements, executed autonomously on blockchain platforms. The proposed project, Smart-Contract Protocols: Theory for Applications (PROCONTRA), seeks to elevate the nascent field of smart contracts to a fully developed scientific discipline. Building on the premise that smart-contract protocols will play a crucial role in practical applications, PROCONTRA aims to establish a comprehensive security framework for their analysis and to innovate the protocols themselves using advanced cryptographic and theoretical modeling techniques.\n\nThe project objectives are multifaceted and ambitious. They include the design of a complete security model for scrutinizing smart-contract protocols, the development and enhancement of these protocols with robust security proofs, and the use of machine-checked proof assistants to ensure the veracity of these proofs. Furthermore, the project will characterize the tasks achievable via smart contracts and the assumptions necessary for their operation.\n\nThe methodology encompasses pen-and-paper security proofs, formal modeling from the vantage point of theoretical cryptography, and the utilization of cutting-edge machine-checked proof assistants. This rigorous approach will be complemented by active engagement with smart-contract practitioners and industry stakeholders, ensuring the project's relevance and practical impact. Participation in standardization initiatives is also planned to further influence the field's trajectory.\n\nAnticipated impacts of PROCONTRA are considerable, promising to propel the advancement of smart-contract protocol science, yield secure and reliable smart-contract protocols, and influence industry practices and standards. The principal investigator brings a significant track record of important contributions in the smart contract arena, lending credibility and expertise to the project's ambitious goals.\n\nIn summary, PROCONTRA stands to be a transformative endeavor that not only advances the theoretical underpinnings of smart contracts but also fosters their practical application and standardization, thereby having a profound and lasting influence beyond the academic sphere."

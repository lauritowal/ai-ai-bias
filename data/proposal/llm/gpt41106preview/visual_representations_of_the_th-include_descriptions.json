        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a multidisciplinary research project focusing on the impact of photography on the understanding and response to the third plague pandemic (1855-1959). The project seeks to explore how the advent of this visual medium influenced the acceptance of bacteriological explanations for infectious diseases and altered public consciousness regarding hygiene, health crises, and the necessity for international public health cooperation. By conducting a comprehensive collection and analysis of visual documents from the pandemic, the project aims to provide a historical and anthropological perspective on the role of these images in shaping geopolitics, colonial dynamics, and biopolitical relations during the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe proposed research will examine the extensive network of visual representations that emerged during the pandemic, which claimed approximately 12 million lives worldwide. The project's innovative approach lies in its attempt to understand how these images contributed to the social imagination of a new, globalized hygienic modernity. The research team, consisting of a Principal Investigator and three postdoctoral researchers, will focus on four specific regions affected by the pandemic: China and Japan; India; Africa; and South and North America. Each region will be subject to an in-depth investigation to trace the visual narrative and its implications for public health consciousness.\n\nThe team will collaboratively examine the visual record of the pandemic, scrutinizing four key themes that are central to the understanding of the pandemic's representation: the built environment, civil disturbance and public order, death practices, and issues of race, class, and discrimination. This comprehensive analysis seeks to unpack the complex interplay between visual culture and the politicization of disease, revealing how images served as a critical medium for negotiating and understanding the global health emergency of the third plague pandemic."

The project will collect and analyse for the first time all visual documents of the third plague pandemic, which broke out in 1855 in Southwest China and raged across the globe until 1959, causing the death of approximately 12 million people. The projectâ€™s aim is to engage in a historical and anthropological analysis of this global network of visual representations, underlining how it played a crucial role in the negotiation of geopolitical, colonial and biopolitical relations at the turn of the 20th century, with great bearing on public health consciousness and the social imagination of a new era of globalised hygienic modernity. Research will focus on four regions: China and Japan; India; Africa; South and North America, the first investigated by the Principal Investigator, while the rest being allocated to 3 postdoctoral researchers, all employed full-time in the project. While investigating the visual record of plague in their respective regions, researchers will engage in a collaborative and interdisciplinary analysis of the entangled history of the visual representation of the third pandemic, taking as a common analytical ground 4 different but vitally interlinked aspects of the visual representation of the pandemic: a) the built environment; b) civil disturbance and public order; c) death, corpses and burial; d) race, class and discrimination.",

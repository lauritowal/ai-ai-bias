        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Time-Programmed Self-Assemblies and Dynamic Materials,\" aims to revolutionize the field of materials science by introducing groundbreaking concepts to precisely program the time domain of self-assembly processes in closed systems. This initiative will enable the creation of transient self-assembled states that exhibit autonomous dynamics and self-regulation behavior, transcending traditional materials limited to static structures.\n\nAt the core of our methodology is the mastery of the kinetics of assembly and disassembly steps, which entails driving systems out-of-equilibrium to reach transient dynamic states with heightened control. Our approaches include developing a generic pH-feedback system for programming the lifetimes of pH-switchable self-assemblies, implementing ATP-fueled, catalytic, dissipative self-assemblies facilitated by antagonistic enzymes, and establishing active structural feedback mechanisms for self-regulation.\n\nThe research will focus on peptide and DNA-based self-assemblies, ensuring precise control over structure formation, tunable pH switching points, and susceptibility to enzymatic transformations. We plan to study the increased complexity and length scales of self-assembly kinetics, delve into the mechanistic details of phase transitions, and investigate steady-state dynamics in transient states.\n\nThe progression of this research will lead from molecular motifs to peptide nanofibrils, DNA-based Au-NP superlattices, and hydrogels, culminating in dynamic materials endowed with self-regulation and time-programmed memory functions. These advancements hold promise for innovative applications, such as self-erasing hydrogels for fluidic guidance in microfluidic systems and reversible shape memory actuators for soft robotics. Ultimately, our long-term goal is to pioneer applications of these materials as biomaterials.\n\nOur research contrasts the conventional focus on function by structure with a novel paradigm that programs function through the time domain, integrating active feedback mechanisms and energy dissipation. This pioneering work aims to yield active and adaptive soft matter, setting a new standard for materials design and application."

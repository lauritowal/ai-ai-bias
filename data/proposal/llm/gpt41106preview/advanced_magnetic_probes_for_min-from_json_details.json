        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Advanced Magnetic Probes for Minimally Invasive Endovascular Surgery\" addresses the critical need for enhanced endovascular instruments in the field of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS). Despite the advantages of current endovascular approaches in treating cardiovascular diseases, they are hampered by manual or tendon-driven mechanisms that limit precision and effectiveness, particularly in accessing anatomically challenging regions. Our proposed solution leverages magnetic actuation to provide flexible instruments capable of generating internal magnetic fields, thus circumventing the reliance on large external magnetic fields that pose a significant challenge.\n\nThe project aims to develop and rigorously evaluate the APOLLO system, a novel flexible probe with shape-optimized magnetic materials that offer unprecedented dexterity and minimal access. This system will consist of sensor-equipped probes, biocompatible magnetic materials, shape sensors, and dedicated control software to ensure precise steerability and enhanced effectiveness in MIS. The expected outcome is a new level of dexterity that will revolutionize clinical adoption of magnetic surgical instruments, enabling advanced diagnostic and treatment options in hard-to-reach areas.\n\nWith performance goals focused on precise steerability, enhanced effectiveness, and improved accessibility, the APOLLO system promises to have a significant clinical impact by facilitating advanced surgical interventions in previously inaccessible regions. The commercial aspiration is to transform magnetic actuation into a commercially successful technology through strong industrial partnerships and a dedicated business development team.\n\nThe proposed technology bridges the gap between current limitations and the potential for advanced cardiovascular disease treatment, setting the stage for a new era in minimally invasive endovascular surgery."

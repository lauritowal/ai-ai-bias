        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Advanced Magnetic Probes for Minimally Invasive Endovascular Surgery\" project is a bold initiative aimed at revolutionizing minimally invasive surgery (MIS), with a focus on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The current paradigm in endovascular interventions relies on manual or tendon-driven instruments, which are limited in precision and effectiveness, particularly in accessing deep-seated or challenging anatomical regions. Our project proposes to overcome these limitations by developing the APOLLO systemâ€”a flexible probe actuated by internal magnetic fields, using shape-optimized magnetic materials to achieve unprecedented dexterity and minimal access capabilities.\n\nAimed at enhancing the effectiveness and accessibility of MIS, this project will address the challenge posed by the reliance on large external magnetic fields, which restrict clinical utility and maneuverability. The APOLLO system will integrate sensor-equipped probes with biocompatible magnetic materials and shape sensors, all governed by dedicated control software. This will enable precise steerability and facilitate advanced surgical interventions that are currently not possible with existing technologies.\n\nThe expected outcomes include a leap in the dexterity of endovascular instruments and the potential for revolutionized clinical adoption of magnetic surgical instruments, with particular impact on performing interventions in anatomically inaccessible regions. Our commercial aspirations are to establish magnetic actuation as a commercially successful technology, leveraging strong industrial partnerships and a dedicated business development team.\n\nThis project represents not only a technological advancement but also a clinical breakthrough, offering advanced diagnostic and therapeutic options, thereby improving patient outcomes and transforming the landscape of MIS.",

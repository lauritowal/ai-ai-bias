        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: LEarning from our collective visual memory to Analyze its trends and Predict future events (LEAP)\n\nThe LEAP project seeks to harness the vast amount of visual data continuously generated and stored in public archives, on the Internet, and through various cameras to construct a collective visual memory. This memory will serve as a foundation for analyzing dynamic patterns, quantifying trends, and predicting future events in dynamic scenes. Our objectives are to develop novel models capable of handling the large-scale, spatio-temporal, and distributed nature of visual data and to generalize these models across different data sources and imaging conditions. The challenge lies in synthesizing complex future predictions based on past visual experiences and measuring long-term changes in related scenes.\n\nThe proposed methodology includes designing new models that can adapt to varying conditions, developing a comprehensive framework for trend analysis, and creating tools for complex prediction synthesis. These efforts will culminate in significant potential impacts across various sectors. In automotive safety, the predictive models will enable cars to anticipate pedestrian behavior, reducing the risk of accidents. In healthcare, the tools developed will assist medical professionals in monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting patient outcomes more effectively. Additionally, smart glasses equipped with our predictive technology will help individuals navigate and react appropriately in unfamiliar situations.\n\nLEAP represents a groundbreaking approach to understanding and leveraging our collective visual memory for practical and wide-ranging applications. Through meticulous analysis and inventive modeling, LEAP has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with and respond to the dynamic world around us, enhancing safety, health, and overall situational awareness. \n\nKeywords: visual data, predictive modeling, collective memory, trend analysis, dynamic patterns, spatio-temporal data, healthcare, automotive safety, smart glasses."

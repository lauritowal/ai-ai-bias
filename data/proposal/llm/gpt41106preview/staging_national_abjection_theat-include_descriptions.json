        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"Staging National Abjection,\" a pioneering research project that examines the intersection of theatre and nation-building in Turkey and its diasporas. The study will explore how theatrical performance has historically contributed to the establishment and maintenance of national identity, as well as how it has been used by marginalized groups to contest their exclusion from the narrative of nationhood. The project spans from the advent of European-style theatre in the mid-19th century Ottoman Empire to present-day theatrical expressions, offering a comprehensive analysis of the role of theatre in crafting the Turkish national identity and its 'Others.'\n\nThe research will employ a robust transdisciplinary approach, utilizing both archival data and ethnographic techniques to scrutinize underexplored areas in the study of Turkish theatre. It will delve into post-Genocide Armenian theatre, the interplay of sexuality and national identity in queer theatre, the emergence of Islamic theatre within Turkey and its diasporas, the cultural productions of Sephardic Jews in Turkey and abroad, and the theatrical representations of the Alevi community. Through these case studies, the project aims to provide new insights into the complex processes of national abjection and the negotiation of belonging.\n\nIn addressing the political economy of Turkish theatre under the influence of conservative neoliberalism, this research will also reflect on the broader theoretical implications for understanding the role of artistic performance in shaping citizenship and belonging within nation-states. It promises to contribute significantly to our knowledge of cultural dynamics in post-Imperial settings and illiberal democracies, enhancing our comprehension of diasporic and refugee theatre in the European context. Through its findings, \"Staging National Abjection\" aspires to advance scholarly discourse on cultural politics and the performative dimensions of identity in contemporary society."

This research will analyse how theatre has served the processes of national abjection, and how abjected minorities have used theatre to negotiate the politics of belonging in Turkey and its diasporas. Employing a rigorous transdisciplinary theoretical and methodological framework, the project will study the key role theatre has played in the constitution of “the Turkish nation” and its Others. Staging National Abjection covers the period from the rise of European-style theatre in the Ottoman Empire in the mid-nineteenth century to contemporary productions. Using both mainstream and alternative archives and ethnographic research methods, the project will investigate topics of vital importance that have received limited academic attention: theatre productions involving Armenians after the Genocide; negotiation of sexuality and national identity in queer dramas; Islamic theatre in Turkey and its European diasporas; Sephardic Jewish theatre in Turkey and diasporic productions in Israel and Europe; and Alevi theatre in Turkey and Europe. These case studies will bring different perspectives to the issue of national abjection, and provide insights into the political economy of contemporary Turkish theatre responding to pressures of a conservative neoliberal government. Using the case of Turkey as a vantage point, this project will ask critical questions of broader theoretical significance about the role of theatre in regulating the politics of belonging in the nation-state, and about the relationship between artistic performance and the everyday performance of citizenship. This research will illustrate the political tensions that define Turkey and its growing diasporas, advance our understanding of diasporic and refugee theatre in Europe, and provide ground-breaking insights into cultural politics in post-Imperial contexts and illiberal democracies.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"MAssive intracellular REcording for Pharmacology\" (MAREP) project proposes an innovative solution to overcome current challenges in the drug development process, specifically addressing the critical issue of cardiac safety assessment. Chronic cardiotoxicities and the use of unreliable cell models have been significant hurdles, leading to increased costs and resources in the development of new drugs. The aim of MAREP is to demonstrate an automated system that can perform comprehensive pharmacologic investigation of drug effects on in-vitro cardiac cell cultures, thereby improving the efficacy of drug development processes.\n\nBuilding upon research innovation from the parent ERC project Neuro-plasmonics, MAREP's approach combines laser excitation of novel metamaterials with high density multielectrode arrays (HD-MEA). This combination allows for the electrical recording and laser-based cell poration of thousands of cardiac cells, facilitating intracellular recording at a level of quality and throughput not previously achievable. The expected outcome is the development of a prototype system that is fully compatible with standard CMOS technology and suitable for large-scale production, thus making the method affordable and globally applicable for studying drug effects on the heart.\n\nThe benefits of MAREP include not only the high throughput and quality of recordings but also the potential to significantly boost the development of new drugs by establishing an affordable, cost-effective, and automated experimental procedure. The commercialization potential of this project lies in introducing a novel interface that brings laser-based bio-nanotechnologies closer to practical application in the pharmaceutical industry. By realizing this prototype, MAREP seeks to revolutionize the cardiac safety assessment gatekeeper role in drug development, providing an essential tool for advancing pharmacological research and development."

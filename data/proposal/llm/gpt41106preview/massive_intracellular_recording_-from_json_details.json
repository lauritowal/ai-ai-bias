        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"MAssive intracellular REcording for Pharmacology\" (MAREP) project aims to revolutionize the drug development landscape by addressing critical bottlenecks in cardiac safety assessment. The current drug development process is hindered by the high costs and resources associated with evaluating cardiac safety, often exacerbated by chronic cardiotoxicities and the use of unreliable cell models. MAREP seeks to overcome these challenges by introducing an automated system that enables comprehensive pharmacologic investigation of drug effects on in-vitro cardiac cell cultures.\n\nLeveraging advancements from the ERC project Neuro-plasmonics, the MAREP project will develop a prototype system that combines laser excitation of novel metamaterials with high-density multielectrode arrays (HD-MEA). This innovative approach will facilitate intracellular recording of thousands of cardiac cells while providing a high throughput and quality of electrical recording. The system's compatibility with standard CMOS technology ensures it is suitable for large scale production and commercialization.\n\nThe expected outcomes include a novel prototype that allows for electrical recording and laser-based cell poration. Beyond simply recording action potentials, this system will affordably and efficiently study the global effects of drugs on the heart. The benefits of MAREP include boosting the development of new drugs and establishing an automated experimental procedure that is both cost-effective and scalable.\n\nBy breaking new ground in bio-nanotechnology and interfacing with existing CMOS technology, MAREP holds the potential to become a game-changer in the pharmacology field. It promises to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with drug development by providing a reliable and affordable method for cardiac safety assessment, ultimately bringing laser-based bio-nanotechnologies closer to commercial reality.",

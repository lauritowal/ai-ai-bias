        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Morbidity due to Loiasis: Population-Wide Evaluation and Identification of Pathogenic Mechanisms\"\n\nLoiasis, caused by the parasitic worm Loa loa, is historically perceived as a benign condition despite affecting 15 million and placing 100 million at risk in Central Africa. This project aims to overturn this perception by proving that loiasis significantly reduces life expectancy and leads to severe complications in multiple organs, including the cardiovascular and renal systems, and can cause functional asplenia.\n\nThrough a rigorous population-wide evaluation involving a sample size of 4900 in rural settings, the study will estimate the prevalences of these associated conditions. The project sets out to redefine loiasis as a harmful disease, with the ultimate goal of including it in the WHO's list of Neglected Tropical Diseases. This recognition is expected to influence the management of high Loa loa infection levels during routine health surveys and onchocerciasis elimination efforts, especially considering the exclusion of ivermectin treatment due to its associated risk of post-treatment encephalopathy.\n\nThe potential outcomes of the study include an impact on the incidence and severity of infections favored by asplenia, such as malaria and pneumonia, leading to the development of specific pneumococcal vaccination recommendations in endemic areas. Ethical implications include the development of strategies to manage high-infection cases responsibly and effectively.\n\nBy challenging the current benign perception of loiasis and providing a detailed understanding of its pathogenic mechanisms, the project holds the promise of transforming public health policies and practices, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions in endemic regions. The research endeavors to bring loiasis to the forefront of global health priorities, ensuring that affected populations receive the attention and resources they deserve."

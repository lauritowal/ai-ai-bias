        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Activity-dependent modulation of synapse identity\" project is an innovative study that explores the intricate relationship between neuronal activity and synapse molecular identity within the olivocerebellar network, a crucial area involved in motor control and cognitive processes. Synapse specificity is vital for the proper functioning of the brain, and its dysregulation is implicated in a range of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. By focusing on the cerebellar Purkinje cells and their excitatory inputs from climbing and parallel fibres, this research aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which neuronal activity influences synapse identity at the molecular level.\n\nThe project's objectives include generating new mouse models to control neuronal activity in vivo, particularly during development stages, and employing these models to describe the molecular diversity and determinants of synapses. The study will develop new genetic tools for neuron- and synapse-specific analysis, combining these tools with the generated mouse models for a comprehensive investigation.\n\nThrough this approach, the project seeks to characterize the molecular attributes that define synapse identity, show how neuronal activity exerts control over these identities, and ultimately provide a unifying view of the mechanisms that guide the development of a functional brain. The insights garnered from this research have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of brain functions and offer valuable knowledge into the etiology of synaptopathies, paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies. This proposal represents a transformative step in neuroscientific research, with implications for the treatment of complex neurological conditions."

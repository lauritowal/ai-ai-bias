        "**Abstract**\n\nThe proposal titled \"The Dynamics of Migration and Economic Adjustment\" aims to investigate the intricate and evolving effects of immigration on the economic landscape of host societies. This research addresses the gap in current literature by focusing on the dynamic interactions among immigrants, firms, and native workers, which unfold over time and shape economic adaptation processes.\n\nThe project is designed to explore several critical dimensions of immigration, including the phenomena of return migration, long-term investments made by immigrants, and the subsequent behavioral changes that occur within immigrant populations. These factors are hypothesized to significantly influence the technology investment strategies of firms and alter the educational and job choices of native workers in the host society.\n\nEmploying a dynamic framework, the study will delve into the inter-temporal choices and interactions among the key agent groups: immigrants, firms, and native workers. The proposed research treats immigration as a dynamic shock that necessitates continuous adjustments by all agents involved. The immigrant population will be examined in terms of their positioning within the native skill distribution over time, while firms' responses will be assessed by observing their technology adjustments, product mix changes, and engagement with regulatory environments. Native workers' adaptations will be explored through the lens of altered career plans.\n\nThe methodological approach combines rigorous theoretical perspectives with empirical analyses, leveraging unique policy experiments and robust data sources. The research will harness longitudinal administrative population data, firm surveys, and individual surveys to construct an empirical foundation for its findings.\n\nThe outcomes of the project aim to present a comprehensive picture of the ongoing adjustment processes in response to immigration, reformulate the analysis of immigrant impacts in a dynamic framework, and pave the way for future research on the dynamic impacts of immigration.\n\nThis research has the potential to transform our understanding of immigration's role in economic adaptation, with profound implications for policy-making and societal integration strategies."

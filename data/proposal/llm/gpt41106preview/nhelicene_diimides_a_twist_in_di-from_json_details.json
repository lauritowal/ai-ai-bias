        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Helicene Diimides: A Twist in Diimide Chemistry\" seeks to revolutionize the field of chiral organic semiconductors (OSCs) through the synthesis and application of a novel class of functional molecules known as [n]helicene diimides ([n]HDI). The primary objective is to develop chiral OSC materials that demonstrate effective chiroptical responses, which are essential for the absorption and emission of circularly polarized light, and dynamic spin-selective charge-transport, crucial for magneto-chiral anisotropy. These characteristics are pivotal for advancing technologies such as spin-LEDs, 3D displays, and quantum-based optical computing.\n\nThe research will employ a multifaceted synthetic strategy, including small-molecule, multi-helicene, and macromolecular approaches, to establish a structure-function relationship, control electronic energy levels, and achieve self-assembly for the development of homochiral multifunctional materials. The proposed [n]HDI materials are expected to bridge critical research fields by incorporating the properties of planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with diimide units and the strong chiroptical responses of 3D [n]helicenes. \n\nBy achieving high fluorescence quantum yields alongside the targeted chiroptical properties, the project aspires to meet the pressing demand for high-performance OSC materials in next-generation optoelectronics. This initiative represents a significant advancement in the understanding of chiral materials science and has the potential to foster breakthroughs in various high-tech applications, positioning it at the forefront of chemical and material research."

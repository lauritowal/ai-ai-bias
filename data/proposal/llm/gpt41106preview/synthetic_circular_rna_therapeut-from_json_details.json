        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Synthetic Circular RNA Therapeutics for Prevention of Sepsis-Associated Organ Failure\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Synthetic Circular RNA Therapeutics for Prevention of Sepsis-Associated Organ Failure\" (CIRCLE), seeks to address the critical challenge of sepsis-associated organ failure—a life-threatening condition with substantial morbidity and mortality. The novel strategy proposed involves the therapeutic delivery of engineered synthetic circular RNAs (circRNAs) to modulate biological pathways within endothelial cells, thereby reversing organ failure in sepsis patients.\n\nThe core objective of CIRCLE is to expand the toolbox of therapeutic RNAs by leveraging the unique features of circRNAs, which include increased intracellular stability, the ability to affect multiple biological pathways, and the potential for cellular context-specific control of protein expression. The project will pioneer innovative techniques for the circularization and purification of large synthetic circRNAs, as well as the establishment of methods for their robust and stable protein expression in eukaryotic cells. Additionally, CIRCLE will develop a new type of degradable polymer with low toxicity for selective and efficient delivery of these RNA constructs.\n\nThe project is divided into four work packages (WPs): WP1 and WP2 focus on engineering novel synthetic circRNAs for modulation of protein expression in sepsis; WP3 and WP4 are dedicated to investigating the delivery of these circRNAs to reverse sepsis-associated lung and kidney failure.\n\nExpected to make significant contributions to pharmaceutical sciences, synthetic biology, and medicine, CIRCLE represents an innovative approach to RNA-based pharmacological intervention. If successful, it could lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of sepsis and its complications, emphasizing the project's profound potential impact on patient outcomes and healthcare practices.\n\n(Word Count: 246)",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Synthetic Circular RNA Therapeutics for Prevention of Sepsis-Associated Organ Failure\n\nThe proposed project, Synthetic Circular RNA Therapeutics for Prevention of Sepsis-Associated Organ Failure (CIRCLE), addresses the critical challenge of reversing sepsis-related organ failure, a significant cause of mortality in intensive care units. The objective of CIRCLE is to innovate RNA-based pharmacological interventions using engineered synthetic circular RNAs (circRNAs) to modulate protein expression in endothelial cells affected by sepsis.\n\nCIRCLE's strategy leverages the unique features of circRNAs, including their increased intracellular stability, the ability to affect multiple biological pathways, and to provide cellular context-specific control over protein expression. The innovative aspects of the project include developing methods for circularization and purification of large synthetic circRNAs, utilizing these circRNAs for robust and stable protein expression in eukaryotic cells, and formulating new degradable polymers for their selective delivery with low toxicity.\n\nThe project is structured into four work packages (WP1-WP4), which encompass engineering novel synthetic circRNAs to modulate protein expression (WP1 and WP2), and investigating the therapeutic delivery of these circRNAs to reverse organ failure in the lungs and kidneys associated with sepsis (WP3 and WP4).\n\nCIRCLE is poised to significantly impact pharmaceutical sciences, synthetic biology, and medicine by providing new avenues for therapeutic RNA application. By extending the toolbox of therapeutic RNAs and exploring their delivery mechanisms, CIRCLE aims to open new frontiers in the treatment of sepsis and potentially transform approaches to managing sepsis-associated organ dysfunction.\n\nKeywords: Synthetic Circular RNAs, Sepsis, Organ Failure, Therapeutic Intervention, Endothelial Cells, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Synthetic Biology, Medicine.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe escalating incidence of sepsis, a life-threatening condition, necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies to mitigate its severe complications, including organ failure. The CIRCLE project, standing at the forefront of this medical challenge, introduces a transformative approach by engineering Synthetic Circular RNA (circRNA) therapeutics to prevent and reverse sepsis-associated organ failure, particularly in the lungs and kidneys. Our objective is to utilize the unique properties of circRNAs—such as increased intracellular stability, the capacity to influence multiple biological pathways, and the potential for cellular context-specific control of protein expression—to modulate critical endothelial cell functions disrupted during sepsis.\n\nThe project is organized into four work packages (WP1-WP4). WP1 and WP2 are dedicated to the engineering of novel synthetic circRNAs capable of modulating protein expression within the septic milieu. WP3 and WP4 focus on the investigation of circRNA delivery systems, evaluating their efficacy in reversing organ failure through targeted RNA-based pharmacological intervention.\n\nInnovations central to CIRCLE include the development of techniques for circularization and purification of large synthetic circRNAs, ensuring robust and stable protein expression in eukaryotic cells, and the synthesis of a novel type of degradable polymer with low toxicity for selective RNA delivery.\n\nThe expected impact of CIRCLE spans pharmaceutical sciences, synthetic biology, and medicine, promising to extend the current therapeutic RNA toolbox and offering a new paradigm for treating sepsis. The successful execution of this project has the potential to transform the management of sepsis, reducing mortality and improving the quality of life for survivors through the prevention of organ failure, thus marking a significant advancement in critical care medicine.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"CIRCLE,\" an innovative project aimed at addressing the critical challenge of sepsis-associated organ failure, a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units. The project's core objective is to reverse organ failure in sepsis by employing a novel class of RNA-based drugs, specifically engineered synthetic circular RNAs (circRNAs). The strategy hinges on the modulation of biological pathways within endothelial cells, capitalizing on the unique properties of circRNAs, such as their increased intracellular stability, the potential to affect multiple biological pathways, and the ability to exert cellular context-specific control of protein expression.\n\nCIRCLE is poised to revolutionize therapeutic approaches within pharmaceutical sciences, synthetic biology, and medicine by achieving two main aims: (1) engineering novel synthetic circRNAs that can effectively modulate protein expression relevant to sepsis, and (2) investigating the therapeutic delivery of these circRNAs to reverse lung and kidney failure associated with sepsis. The project will develop new techniques for the circularization and purification of large synthetic circRNAs and establish methods for their robust and stable expression in eukaryotic cells. Innovations also include the synthesis of new types of degradable polymers designed for the selective delivery of these large RNAs with low toxicity, enhancing their potential as therapeutic agents.\n\nThe CIRCLE project is structured into four work packages (WP1-WP4), each contributing to the overarching goal of creating a new toolbox of therapeutic RNAs. The expected impact of this research is significant, with potential breakthroughs that could lead to RNA-based pharmacological interventions capable of reversing the devastating effects of sepsis and improving patient outcomes."

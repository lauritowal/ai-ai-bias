        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"CIRCLE,\" an innovative project aimed at addressing the critical challenge of sepsis-associated organ failure, a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units. The project's core objective is to reverse organ failure in sepsis by employing a novel class of RNA-based drugs, specifically engineered synthetic circular RNAs (circRNAs). The strategy hinges on the modulation of biological pathways within endothelial cells, capitalizing on the unique properties of circRNAs, such as their increased intracellular stability, the potential to affect multiple biological pathways, and the ability to exert cellular context-specific control of protein expression.\n\nCIRCLE is poised to revolutionize therapeutic approaches within pharmaceutical sciences, synthetic biology, and medicine by achieving two main aims: (1) engineering novel synthetic circRNAs that can effectively modulate protein expression relevant to sepsis, and (2) investigating the therapeutic delivery of these circRNAs to reverse lung and kidney failure associated with sepsis. The project will develop new techniques for the circularization and purification of large synthetic circRNAs and establish methods for their robust and stable expression in eukaryotic cells. Innovations also include the synthesis of new types of degradable polymers designed for the selective delivery of these large RNAs with low toxicity, enhancing their potential as therapeutic agents.\n\nThe CIRCLE project is structured into four work packages (WP1-WP4), each contributing to the overarching goal of creating a new toolbox of therapeutic RNAs. The expected impact of this research is significant, with potential breakthroughs that could lead to RNA-based pharmacological interventions capable of reversing the devastating effects of sepsis and improving patient outcomes."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project \"The Global Impact of Coastal Water Contamination on Economic Development\" (GLOBCOADEV) seeks to address a critical gap in understanding how coastal water pollution affects socio-economic development in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), home to over three billion people. Coastal waters are vital for food security and livelihoods, yet their contamination has profound implications for marine life and local economies. This study's pioneering research aims to provide insights into the causal relationships between coastal water contamination and economic development over the past five decades on a global scale.\n\nThe GLOBCOADEV project will utilize advanced micro-econometric techniques to exploit exogenous variation in contamination events such as rivers' release patterns and climate change influences, thus enabling a robust analysis of the long-term impacts of pollution. The project will rely on a wide array of data sources, including household surveys and satellite imaging, to achieve its objectives.\n\nThe objectives of the research are threefold: firstly, to assess the effect of coastal water contamination on early-childhood development, with a particular focus on nutrition; secondly, to determine the impact on local economic activities, especially fishing patterns and broader economic development indicators; and thirdly, to investigate the side effects of contamination, including shifts in political attitudes, an upsurge in violence, and rural-urban migration trends.\n\nAnticipated outcomes of GLOBCOADEV include substantial contributions to the academic literature, influencing the design of evidence-based environmental protection policies, and aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). By addressing the existing knowledge limitations, the project holds the potential to inform interventions that could safeguard and enhance food security, protect livelihoods, and foster sustainable economic development in affected populations across LMICs."

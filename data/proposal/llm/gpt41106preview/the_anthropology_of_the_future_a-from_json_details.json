        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Anthropology of the Future: An Art World Perspective\" (ANTHROFUTURE) project is a groundbreaking research endeavor that seeks to investigate the rapid acceleration of the future into the present, a phenomenon catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the art world as its ethnographic focus, this project aims to systematically explore the transformative integration of digital and physical realms and its impact on future imaginations, particularly in the face of social, ecological, and biopolitical crises.\n\nThe primary objectives of ANTHROFUTURE are to conduct systematic research on the evolving digital-physical art world, develop innovative multimodal methodologies for studying future orientations, and contribute analytical and theoretical advancements regarding the future as a distinct time zone. The project will employ a combination of in-person, digital, and visual ethnography, alongside large-scale social media data harvesting and artist-led subprojects to gather comprehensive data. The research will be conducted in the regional contexts of India and Pakistan, providing a much-needed perspective from the global south.\n\nANTHROFUTURE is poised to innovate the field of future studies by integrating ethnographic practices with novel digital techniques, addressing the lack of scholarship on the post-pandemic digital-physical infrastructure of the art world. The project will create a new integrated system for understanding and modeling the art world's response to the pandemic, with implications for broader future-oriented scholarship and practice.\n\nLed by a project investigator with extensive experience in both art world and global south studies, ANTHROFUTURE aims to set a precedent for how anthropology can engage with the concept of the future. The project's innovations promise not only to contribute to academic discourse but also to offer practical insights for the burgeoning digital-physical system in the art world."

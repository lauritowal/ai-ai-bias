        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Targeting mechanisms of Thrombo-inflammation\" embarks on a groundbreaking exploration to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of thrombo-inflammatory diseases, a critical area of research magnified by the Covid-19 pandemic. While tissue factor (TF) and the IFNAR1 heterodimer have been identified as pivotal to the pathology of diseases ranging from viral/bacterial infections to cardiovascular complications and cancer, our understanding of their interaction remains limited. This proposal sets out to deconstruct the molecular switch involving TF and IFNAR1, which remains inactive on resting cells but can be triggered by various stimuli, including fVII/fVIIa, LPS, and polyIC, leading to TF-mediated coagulation, IFNAR1-mediated inflammation, and altered cellular metabolism.\n\nOur objectives are threefold: (1) to investigate the regulation of the TF-IFNAR1 molecular switch in an organ and context-specific manner, utilizing in vitro studies and cell-specific inducible TF±IFNAR1 deficient mice; (2) to determine the consequences of this switch on intracellular signaling, inflammatory processes, and mitochondrial metabolism through omics and bioinformatic analyses; and (3) to identify the essential molecular structures that facilitate the TF-IFNAR1 interaction using advanced techniques such as cross-linking, crystallography, phage display, and computational modeling.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is twofold: to provide a novel conceptual framework for understanding the complex interplay of coagulation, inflammation, and metabolism in thrombo-inflammation, and to pave the way for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for these pervasive diseases. Our comprehensive approach promises to yield significant insights that could revolutionize the management and treatment of thrombo-inflammatory conditions, with broad implications for global health.\n\nWord Count: 254 words"

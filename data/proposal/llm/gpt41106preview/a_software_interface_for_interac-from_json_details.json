        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"A Software Interface for Interactive Ensemble-Based Drug Design\" (EBDD) project, funded under ERC-StG-2013-336289, aims to revolutionize preclinical drug discovery with an innovative human-computer interaction workflow. This project's goal is to prototype a software interface that fundamentally enhances the value and utility of academic research in drug design, fostering new types of R&D processes that are more interactive and efficient.\n\nOur multidisciplinary team plans to develop a prototype featuring an intuitive and robust graphical user interface with high-quality 3D data visualization capabilities. This interface will enable real-time interactions with simulations running on remote high-performance computing resources, making advanced drug design accessible to a broader scientific community. The simulation protocols will be standardized for non-expert use and rigorously validated against industry benchmarks for robustness, ensuring the software's reliability and relevance to industry standards.\n\nCollaboration with a professional software SME specializing in interactive scientific data visualization and a large EU biopharmaceutical company will provide the necessary expertise and industry insight. These partnerships will facilitate the iterative testing and refinement of the prototype, ensuring its alignment with current industry needs and practices.\n\nThe EBDD's commercial potential is high, as initial results already indicate its capability to support and improve R&D processes in preclinical drug discovery. Upon completion, the software is expected to meet industry standards and be ready for commercialization, contributing to the acceleration and efficiency of drug development pipelines.\n\nKeywords: interactive drug design, human-computer workflow, preclinical research, high-performance computing, scientific visualization, industry collaboration, commercialization."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"A Software Interface for Interactive Ensemble-Based Drug Design\" (EBDD) project aims to revolutionize preclinical drug discovery by developing a prototype for an interactive human-computer drug design workflow. Funded under the European Research Council's (ERC) Starting Grant program (ERC-StG-2013-336289), this initiative seeks to enhance the value of academic software while enabling novel research and development (R&D) processes. The software will support critical stages of drug development, including hit discovery, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization.\n\nThe core of the EBDD project is to create an intuitive and robust graphical user interface that provides high-quality 3D data visualization and facilitates real-time interactions with simulations on remote high-performance computing resources. The software will incorporate standardised simulation protocols that have been validated against industry benchmarks, ensuring its reliability for users ranging from academic institutions to large biopharmaceutical companies.\n\nCollaboration with a professional software SME specializing in interactive scientific data visualization and a large EU biopharmaceutical company will be instrumental in developing and refining the prototype. These partners will contribute to testing and providing iterative feedback, thereby ensuring that the software meets the high standards required for commercial viability.\n\nThe first results from the EBDD project demonstrate its potential to support essential R&D processes within preclinical drug discovery. With its high commercialisation potential, the EBDD software interface aims to establish a new benchmark in the industry, enhancing the efficacy and efficiency of drug design.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the development of 'A Software Interface for Interactive Ensemble-Based Drug Design' (EBDD), aimed at revolutionizing the preclinical drug discovery process. The project, with the ERC project code ERC-StG-2013-336289, has already received funding and has shown promising potential to support R&D in its initial phase. The primary objectives of EBDD are to prototype a groundbreaking human-computer interaction workflow for drug design, enhance the value of academic software, and enable innovative R&D processes within the preclinical stage.\n\nThe proposed software will feature an intuitive and robust graphical user interface, high-quality 3D data visualization, and the capability for real-time interactions with simulations on remote high-performance computing resources. To ensure accessibility and reliability, the software will include standardized simulation protocols, which will be validated against industry benchmarks.\n\nIn a strategic partnership, a professional software SME specializing in interactive scientific data visualization and a prominent EU biopharmaceutical company will collaborate on the development. The SME will be responsible for prototyping the software, while the biopharmaceutical company will provide iterative testing and feedback, ensuring the prototype meets the rigorous demands of the industry.\n\nThe commercial potential of the EBDD is significant, as it is designed to meet industry standards and is poised for rapid commercialization. By providing an interface that enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of drug discovery, EBDD stands to become an indispensable tool in the pharmaceutical industry, ultimately contributing to the acceleration of bringing new therapeutic drugs to market.",

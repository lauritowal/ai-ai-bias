        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Designing Devices by Doping on Demand\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Designing Devices by Doping on Demand,\" aims to revolutionize the semiconductor industry by introducing an innovative electrochemical method for doping emerging semiconductor materials such as conductive polymers, fullerenes, and quantum dots. The versatility of the developed technology allows for unprecedented control over charge carrier density and enables precise patterning akin to photolithography, which is essential for creating new device geometries like lateral pn junctions.\n\nOur team has pioneered a method that combines electrochemical doping with photopolymerization techniques to overcome limitations associated with traditional doping methods that are inapplicable to these novel materials. Through this approach, we can finely tune the electronic properties of materials, paving the way for the development of on-chip integration of solution-processable LEDs, more efficient solar cells, and other innovative applications that can significantly reduce energy consumption and support sustainability goals.\n\nThe project's goals include the investigation of the application potential of this technology, the development of demonstrator devices to showcase its practical utility, the protection of intellectual property arising from the research, and the analysis of industrial interest to ensure the technology's economic viability and relevance.\n\nThis research has the potential to not only transform the semiconductor industry but also to make substantial contributions to the economy and sustainability objectives by enabling the production of more energy-efficient devices and improving solar energy harvesting capabilities."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Family ties that bind: A new view of internal migration, immobility and labour-market outcomes,\" known as FamilyTies, investigates the influence of family connections on internal migration decisions and the resultant labour-market outcomes. The project's central aim is to identify the role of family ties as a potential deterrent of migration and a key determinant of immobility, as well as their impact on individuals' labour-market success.\n\nWith a comprehensive approach, FamilyTies will explore how migration towards family locales compares to other migration patterns, determining the extent to which family-related motives influence migration and immobility for various subjects. It will also unravel the differences in labour-market outcomes for individuals who migrate versus those who remain immobile, particularly in relation to family ties versus other factors.\n\nThe research will utilize a rich array of data sources, including geo-coded registers, census and survey data from multiple countriesâ€”Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, the USA, and New Zealand. Advanced analytical methods, such as hazard regression, logistic regression, OLS regression, and structural equation models, will be employed to accurately model the complexities of internal migration and labour-market phenomena. Careful consideration will be given to the nuances of multilevel, multi-actor data structures, as well as to challenges such as endogeneity and self-selection.\n\nFamilyTies promises to deliver groundbreaking insights into the dynamics of internal migration and immobility, offering critical input for predictions and policies related to migration patterns, population growth and decline, ethnic segregation, labour-market flexibility, and family support systems. By incorporating a novel perspective that accounts for contemporary family complexity, this project stands to reshape our understanding of the social and economic forces that drive internal migration and to inform more effective policy-making for the benefit of individuals, families, and societies at large."

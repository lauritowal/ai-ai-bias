        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Family ties that bind: A new view of internal migration, immobility and labour-market outcomes,\" also known as \"FamilyTies,\" aims to delve into the often-overlooked influence of family ties on migration decisions and subsequent labour-market outcomes. This project posits that family connections can serve as both a draw and a deterrent for internal migration, and that these family-related decisions significantly shape the labour-market trajectories of individuals.\n\nThe research will explore several objectives: firstly, to identify the role of family ties as a deterrent for migration and a key determinant of immobility; secondly, to explain the propensity for migration towards family in contrast to other migration directions; thirdly, to determine to what extent and for whom family-related motives influence the choice to migrate or remain immobile; and finally, to unravel the differences in labour-market outcomes for those who migrate compared to those who stay put due to family ties as opposed to other factors.\n\nEmploying a robust array of analytical methods including hazard regression, logistic regression, OLS regression, and structural equation models, the project will analyze geo-coded register, census, and survey data from a range of countries including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, the USA, and New Zealand. The analysis will address multilevel, multi-actor data structures and account for potential endogeneity and self-selection.\n\nThe expected contributions of FamilyTies are profound, promising new insights into the dynamics of migration and immobility, with significant implications for policy and predictions relating to migration, population changes, ethnic segregation, labour-market flexibility, and family support systems. This research will introduce a novel perspective on the role of family ties beyond the household unit in shaping migration behavior, considering the complexities of contemporary family structures.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"FamilyTies\" project, titled \"Family ties that bind: A new view of internal migration, immobility and labour-market outcomes,\" embarks on an innovative exploration of the understudied influence of family ties on internal migration decisions and their resulting labor market outcomes. This research aims to shift the conventional narrative that internal migration predominantly leads to positive individual and household benefits by emphasizing the significant, yet often overlooked, role of family ties beyond the immediate household.\n\nThe project's core objectives are to identify the degree to which family connections deter migration and establish immobility, to clarify the propensity for migration toward family as opposed to other migration patterns, to pinpoint the extent and demographic segments for whom family-related motives are primary drivers of migration or immobility, and to dissect the disparity in labor market outcomes for individuals whose mobility is tied to family connections versus those motivated by other factors.\n\nEmploying a comprehensive range of analytical methods—hazard regression, logistic regression, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and structural equation models—the project will analyze geo-coded register, census, and survey data from a selection of countries with diverse migration contexts, including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States, and New Zealand.\n\nThis meticulous approach, considering multilevel and multi-actor data structures as well as potential issues of endogeneity and self-selection, positions \"FamilyTies\" to yield substantial contributions to our understanding of migration dynamics. Anticipated outcomes include novel insights into the interplay between migration, immobility, and labor market outcomes, and the provision of essential data to inform predictions and policies regarding migration patterns, population changes, ethnic segregation, labor market flexibility, and the support structures of families.\n\nThe \"FamilyTies\" project promises to redefine the landscape of migration research by integrating the complexity of contemporary family structures into the study of internal migration and its economic implications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Family ties that bind: A new view of internal migration, immobility and labour-market outcomes\" (FamilyTies) project offers a groundbreaking examination of the understudied relationship between family ties and migration decisions within borders, and how these impact labour-market outcomes. Despite a common assumption that internal migration is beneficial for individuals and households, FamilyTies hypothesizes that family ties may act as a significant deterrent to migration, resulting in varying levels of immobility and diverse labour-market consequences.\n\nThe aim of FamilyTies is to identify the role of family ties in internal migration and immobility, and to discern their influence on labour-market outcomes. The objectives are to ascertain the extent to which family connections prevent migration, to compare migratory movements towards family versus other migration directions, to determine the demographic groups for whom family motives are a primary driver for remaining immobile or migrating, and to expose the differential labour-market outcomes for individuals whose (im)mobility is influenced by family ties versus other factors.\n\nEmploying a robust methodological approach, the project will utilize advanced statistical techniques, including hazard regression, logistic regression, OLS regression, and structural equation models. This analysis will be conducted on a rich dataset comprising geo-coded register and census data, as well as survey data from multiple countries including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, the USA, and New Zealand. The analysis will account for multilevel and multi-actor data structures, potential endogeneity issues, and self-selection biases.\n\nExpected contributions of FamilyTies include novel insights into the drivers of internal migration and immobility, and their implications for labour-market outcomes. These insights will be instrumental in informing migration predictions and policies, addressing issues related to population growth and decline, ethnic segregation, labour-market flexibility, and family support systems. The project promises to advance the understanding of contemporary family complexity and its influence on migration choices, thus shaping socio-economic planning and interventions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Family ties that bind: A new view of internal migration, immobility and labour-market outcomes,\" known as FamilyTies, investigates the influence of family connections on internal migration decisions and the resultant labour-market outcomes. The project's central aim is to identify the role of family ties as a potential deterrent of migration and a key determinant of immobility, as well as their impact on individuals' labour-market success.\n\nWith a comprehensive approach, FamilyTies will explore how migration towards family locales compares to other migration patterns, determining the extent to which family-related motives influence migration and immobility for various subjects. It will also unravel the differences in labour-market outcomes for individuals who migrate versus those who remain immobile, particularly in relation to family ties versus other factors.\n\nThe research will utilize a rich array of data sources, including geo-coded registers, census and survey data from multiple countries—Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, the USA, and New Zealand. Advanced analytical methods, such as hazard regression, logistic regression, OLS regression, and structural equation models, will be employed to accurately model the complexities of internal migration and labour-market phenomena. Careful consideration will be given to the nuances of multilevel, multi-actor data structures, as well as to challenges such as endogeneity and self-selection.\n\nFamilyTies promises to deliver groundbreaking insights into the dynamics of internal migration and immobility, offering critical input for predictions and policies related to migration patterns, population growth and decline, ethnic segregation, labour-market flexibility, and family support systems. By incorporating a novel perspective that accounts for contemporary family complexity, this project stands to reshape our understanding of the social and economic forces that drive internal migration and to inform more effective policy-making for the benefit of individuals, families, and societies at large."

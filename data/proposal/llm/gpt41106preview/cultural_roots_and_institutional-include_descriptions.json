        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces an ambitious, pioneering comparative research project aimed at dissecting the multifaceted institutional factors influencing teachers' careers and the broader teaching profession in Europe. With educational systems at a crossroads, grappling with diminished appeal, fragmentation, and persistent teacher shortages, our study seeks to illuminate the path forward by analyzing the evolution of teacher policy and its implications on the profession's status and workforce diversification. By focusing on three distinct educational systems—Belgium, France, and England—over the past three decades, the project is structured around four critical objectives: elucidating the nature of teacher policy, examining the shifts in the teaching profession's status, investigating the teacher allocation processes amid varying professional conditions, and forecasting patterns of teacher attrition and migration within a nuanced multilevel framework.\n\nEmploying a robust post-comparative mixed-method approach, the project is organized into four work packages that encompass policy, supply, labour markets, and mobility. Our methodology integrates policy analysis, secondary data evaluation of national and international datasets, qualitative studies of national labour markets, multilevel analyses of teacher mobility data, and semi-structured interviews with individuals who have either refrained from entering or prematurely exited the profession.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is the generation of groundbreaking theoretical insights into teacher labour markets and the advancement of our understanding regarding the transformation of educational systems within the context of diminishing national sovereignty, growing inter-sectoral interdependence, and the partitioning of individual life spheres. This knowledge will not only provide a foundation for informed policy-making but also contribute to the strategic revitalization of the teaching profession, ensuring its sustainability and effectiveness in the face of contemporary challenges."

The functioning of the profession suffers from low attractiveness, fragmentation, and teacher shortages. This proposal constitutes the first systematic comparative project in Europe aimed at understanding the role of the institutional dimensions affecting teachers’ careers and the teaching profession as a whole. It has four objectives: [1] to explain the nature of teacher policy over the last thirty years in different educational systems (Belgium, France and England); [2] to understand the changing status of the teaching profession and its impact on the diversification of the teaching workforce; [3] to analyse the processes by which teachers are allocated into increasingly diverse working and professional conditions; and [4] to model and predict teacher attrition and migration within a common but differentiated multilevel framework. This project will adopt a post-comparative mixed-method design organized around four work packages on teacher policy, supply, labour markets and mobility. It will combine five methods: policy analysis of teachers’ recruitment and careers; secondary data analyses of relevant national and international datasets on teacher supply and the profession’s attractiveness; a qualitative, in-depth study of three national labour-market spaces; multilevel multi-group analyses of original datasets on teacher mobility, and semi-structured interviews with non-entrants and early leavers. This project will produce new theoretical knowledge about labour markets for teachers and contribute to the reconceptualization of the nature of institutional change affecting educational systems in a society characterized by the progressive decline of nation states, increased interdependence between societal fields and the fragmentation of individual life spheres.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Inside mechanisms sustaining cancer stem cells,\" seeks to unlock the intricacies of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and their pivotal role in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. Grounded in the Cancer Stem Cell Hypothesis, the research focuses on the molecular underpinnings that enable CSCs to promote tumour growth and survival. Specifically, the project will delve into how the inactivation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene and the upregulation of the p21 cell-cycle inhibitor contribute to the self-renewal and replicative longevity of CSCs, which are crucial for the persistence and recurrence of cancer.\n\nThe objectives of the study are fourfold: to investigate the expansion of the CSC pool resulting from p53 loss and the possible activation of the Myc oncogene; to explore p53-independent pathways that might facilitate CSC self-renewal; to understand how p21-induced cell-cycle arrest can protect CSCs from exhaustion of their self-renewal capacity; and to determine whether activation of p21 in CSCs leads to a mutator phenotype, which could underpin mechanisms of chemoresistance.\n\nThe research team will employ an array of innovative methodologies, including in vivo shRNA screens, analysis of cell-cycle dynamics, assessment of DNA damage and mutation rates, and advanced clonal tracking techniques using barcoded lentiviral libraries. Additionally, the team will utilize transplantation-independent assays and monitor tumour re-growth in vivo post cytotoxic treatments to validate their findings.\n\nThe long-term goal of this groundbreaking research is to identify CSC-specific targets for pharmacological intervention, which could revolutionize the therapeutic landscape for cancer treatment. By elucidating the mechanisms that sustain the CSC population, this project has the potential to pave the way for the development of novel, more effective cancer therapies that can prevent tumour relapse and improve patient outcomes."

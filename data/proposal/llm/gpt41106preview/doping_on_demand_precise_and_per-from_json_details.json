        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Doping on Demand: precise and permanent control of the Fermi level in nanocrystal assemblies,\" aims to revolutionize the field of optoelectronics by creating a novel method to electronically dope semiconductor nanocrystal (QD) assemblies and porous semiconductors. Quantum dots are small semiconductor crystals whose size-tunable electronic properties make them ideal for a variety of optoelectronic applications. However, the electronic doping of QDs remains a significant challenge, which this project seeks to address.\n\nThrough an innovative approach that utilizes electrochemical charge injection to introduce external electrolyte ions and various strategies for dopant immobilization—including freezing the electrolyte solvent at room temperature and chemically linking ions to ligands on the QD surface—this project endeavors to achieve stable doped nanocrystal assemblies with a constant Fermi level. The potential during electrochemical charging will be carefully controlled to ensure the desired doping level.\n\nTo secure the stability of the doped QDs, atomic layer deposition will be employed to encapsulate the films. The anticipated outcome is a groundbreaking ability to permanently set the Fermi level in QDs, potentially leading to enhanced performance and new functionalities of optoelectronic devices such as LEDs, FETs, and solar cells. The project promises to yield unprecedented control over the doping level in QD films, optimize optoelectronic devices, and enable the development of degenerately doped, low-threshold QD lasers for continuous wave excitation, QD laser diodes with electrical charge injection, and optimized pin and first-time pn junction QD solar cells with precise Fermi level control.\n\nUltimately, the success of this project could pave the way for the next generation of optoelectronic devices and significantly impact the fields of lighting, energy harvesting, and electronic displays.\n\n(Word Count: 281)"

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project \"On-chip optical communication with transformation optics\" aims to revolutionize computer chip performance by overcoming the inherent limitations of traditional communication wiring. As computational power continues to grow exponentially, the stagnation of clock speeds and the challenges in core integration due to wiring—such as space consumption, energy inefficiency, and heat production—have become significant bottlenecks. Building upon the success of a miniature prototype developed under an ERC Advanced Grant project, this Proof of Concept project seeks to utilize transformation optics as an innovative alternative to conventional wiring. The core concept involves enhancing on-chip communication capabilities through the integration of optical fibers, thereby offering a solution to the pressing issues of space, energy, and thermal management in densely packed cores. The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve performance that not only matches but exceeds industry standards, thus ensuring the commercial viability of the technology. With the potential to catalyze a paradigm shift in on-chip communication, this project promises to sustain Moore's law and support the continued exponential increase in computational power."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, entitled \"Repair mechanisms of topoisomerase II DNA lesions,\" aims to elucidate the cellular responses to DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP2-DPCs) arising from the use of topoisomerase II (TOP2) chemotherapeutics such as etoposide. Since its approval in 1983, etoposide has been a cornerstone treatment for various cancers including leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors. However, the repair pathways that cells employ to counteract TOP2-DPCs, which can stall the catalytic cycle and compromise genomic integrity, remain inadequately defined.\n\nUsing Xenopus egg extracts, a system that faithfully recapitulates DNA repair mechanisms, this research will dissect the molecular processes behind TOP2-DPC repair. Preliminary data suggest that the SUMOylation of TOP2 by the enzyme ZATT is a primary response to TOP2-DPC damage, implying that ZATT is a critical player in the repair cascade. This study will investigate the activation, coordination, and cellular preference among distinct repair modes, including crosslink reversal, protein adduct degradation, and DNA incision.\n\nThe main research questions are centered around the mechanisms by which repair is activated, how different repair pathways are coordinated, and which pathways are preferentially employed by cells. Our goals are to achieve a molecular understanding of TOP2-DPC repair mechanisms, identify molecular triggers for repair routes, and, ultimately, uncover new opportunities and targets for cancer treatment improvement.\n\nThis research holds the potential to enhance our understanding of genomic stability, inform the development of targeted cancer therapies, and mitigate the side effects associated with chemotherapeutic treatment. Given the widespread clinical use of TOP2 inhibitors and the prevalence of treatment-associated secondary malignancies, the findings from this study could have significant implications for cancer therapy and patient prognosis."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe grant proposal \"Understanding Life Trajectories of Immigrants and Their Descendants in Europe and Projecting Future Trends\" targets a comprehensive analysis of the life domains of employment, housing, and family among post-WWII and post-1990 immigrants and their descendants in four key European regions: the UK, France, Germany, and Sweden. This project seeks to dissect the intricate evolution and interplay of these domains, employing sophisticated analytical techniques such as multichannel sequence analysis, multilevel event history analysis, and microsimulation, all grounded in large-scale longitudinal data.\n\nCentral to the study's aims is the examination of how the interaction of employment, housing, and family trajectories unfolds over time. It focuses on understanding the influence of societal and early-life contexts, as well as the critical transitions that shape the life histories of these populations. A pivotal aspect of the research is the projection of future life trajectories using advanced simulation techniques, which will enable the anticipation of long-term trends and potential policy needs.\n\nThe objectives are manifold, including the investigation of the causes of heterogeneity in life domains, determining whether disparities between immigrants and natives are ephemeral or indicative of distinct life pathways, and assessing whether heterogeneity within immigrant groups diminishes or persists across generations.\n\nThis project promises to deliver a deeper understanding of the relationships between critical life domains, elucidate the causes behind the varying degrees of success in immigrant life trajectories, and provide insights into the persistence or disappearance of heterogeneity over time. The outcomes are anticipated to have significant implications for social policy and integration strategies, promoting a more equitable and informed approach to managing Europe's diverse populations."

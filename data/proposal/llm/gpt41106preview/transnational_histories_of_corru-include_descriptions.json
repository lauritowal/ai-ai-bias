        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the objectives of TransCorr, a pioneering historical research project aimed at dissecting the evolution of \"corruption\" as a concept in South-East-Central Europe from 1750 to 1850. During this time, the region was widely criticized for its political corruption by both foreign commentators and local critics, who attributed such practices to cultural stagnation and economic malaise. These criticisms have persisted into modern discourse, shaping the region's contemporary reputation and self-perception.\n\nTransCorr proposes to investigate how \"corruption\" was constructed and instrumentalized by various actors, including regional leaders and external powers, particularly against the backdrop of burgeoning ideas of modernity from Western Europe. The project will delve into the reframing of traditional customs as corrupt by regional elites and the impact of Great Power politics on the propagation of these perceptions, often with negative connotations linked to the Ottoman influence.\n\nBy excavating this historical narrative, TransCorr seeks to elucidate the genealogy of \"corruption\" and its entrenchment in the regional and global consciousness. The research aims to integrate the study of South-East-Central Europe into the broader historical discourse on modernization, challenging existing historiographical paradigms. Additionally, it aspires to recontextualize ongoing discussions on patronage and graft while reshaping the understanding of center-periphery dynamics within Europe.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is a nuanced re-evaluation of the historical narrative surrounding \"corruption,\" which will contribute to the scientific literature and inform contemporary debates. TransCorr's findings will offer fresh perspectives on historical processes that continue to influence political and social structures in South-East-Central Europe and beyond."

A wide range of foreign observers portrayed graft, nepotism, and bribery as endemic. Indigenous critics echoed many of these assessments. Regional insiders and outsiders alike mobilized commentaries on “corruption” for their own political, professional, and personal ends, claiming they could run more honest and efficient administrations, military regimes, and commercial operations than those in power. These notables linked “corruption” to the region's supposed cultural backwardness and economic under-development. In doing so, public figures naturalized notions of “corruption,” making it appear both widespread and organic in the region—popularizing tropes that have endured right down to the present. Yet, “corruption” is a historically specific concept. TransCorr seeks to construct a history of the idea of “corruption” in Central-South-East Europe in conjunction with the rise of modernity. It demonstrates how in the context of new ideas about modernity emanating from West Europe, regional leaders reframed a host of traditional customs and practices as corrupt. It examines how Great Power attempts to transform these borderlands into formal and informal imperial provinces further entrenched novel understandings of “corruption”, often pejoratively associating them with the Ottoman legacy. By tracing out this history, TransCorr reveals a genealogy of ideas, discourses, and attitudes that continue to inform analyses of and discussions within the region today. The project brings the study of this geographic area into greater dialogue with a global story of modernization and aligns the region’s historiography with new innovations in the scientific literature. It also reframes contemporary debates on patronage and graft, and reconfigures broader understandings of center-periphery relations within the region and across the continent.",

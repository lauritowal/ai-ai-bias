        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The basic principles of polyploidy in plants and animals,\" aims to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying polyploidy, a condition where organisms, specifically eukaryotes, possess more than two complete sets of chromosomes due to whole-genome duplication (WGD). Polyploidy is a pivotal phenomenon that has been linked with speciation bursts and evolutionary innovations, particularly during periods of extreme climate change. Despite its significance, most new polyploids rarely survive, leading to a low survival rate and rarity of successful polyploid species.\n\nThis cross-disciplinary research will focus on two species complexes, Arabidopsis lyrata (a plant from the Northern Hemisphere) and Neobatrachus (burrowing frogs from the Australian desert), employing classic genetics, the latest genomics technologies, and population genetics analysis. Through a broad geographical scope, leveraging natural herbarium and museum collections, the study will address three primary objectives: to understand the triggering factors of polyploidy, to enable initial survival of polyploid organisms, and to stabilize polyploid populations.\n\nThe research activities will include mapping the natural variation of unreduced gametes rates to expose genetic and environmental predispositions to polyploidy, comparing recombination and selection across ploidies to reveal stabilizing mechanics in polyploids, and reconstructing introgression patterns to uncover recovery processes of polyploid populations.\n\nThe project's anticipated impact extends across fields such as biology, agriculture, and medicine, with the potential for groundbreaking advances. By deciphering the mechanisms leading to successful polyploidization, the research will not only contribute to our understanding of evolutionary processes but also provide insights that could inform conservation strategies and improve crop resilience.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The Basic Principles of Polyploidy in Plants and Animals,\" seeks to elucidate the fundamental aspects of polyploidy, a condition characterized by organisms having more than two complete sets of chromosomes as a result of whole-genome duplication (WGD). This cross-disciplinary study aims to explore the occurrence of polyploidy across eukaryotic species, particularly in the plant Arabidopsis lyrata and the burrowing frog Neobatrachus, dwelling in the Northern Hemisphere and the Australian desert, respectively.\n\nDespite the low survival rate of new polyploid species, evidence suggests that polyploidy has been a driver of speciation bursts and evolutionary inventions throughout history, often associated with periods of extreme climate change. The research will employ a broad geographical scope and a combination of classic genetics, advanced genomics technologies, and population genetics analysis, utilizing both natural herbarium and museum collections.\n\nThe project’s objectives include investigating the triggering factors of polyploidy, understanding the initial survival mechanisms of polyploids, and determining the processes behind the stabilization and success of polyploid populations. Specific research activities will focus on mapping the natural variation of unreduced gametes rates, comparing recombination and selection across different ploidies, and reconstructing introgression patterns to reveal how polyploid populations recover after bottlenecks.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is to expose predispositions to polyploidy, reveal stabilizing mechanics in polyploids, and uncover the recovery processes of polyploid populations. These findings hold the potential for groundbreaking advances with relevance across biology, agriculture, and medicine, contributing to a better understanding of evolutionary processes and the development of new strategies for species conservation and crop improvement.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Basic Principles of Polyploidy in Plants and Animals\n\nPolyploidy, the state of having more than two sets of chromosomes due to whole-genome duplication (WGD), is a critical evolutionary mechanism with profound implications across biology, agriculture, and medicine. The proposed cross-disciplinary research aims to elucidate the fundamental principles governing polyploidy in eukaryotic organisms, particularly in plant species such as Arabidopsis lyrata and animal species like the Neobatrachus burrowing frogs. Our project seeks to understand the triggering factors of polyploidy, the initial survival mechanisms of polyploids, and the factors that lead to the population stabilization and success of polyploids in harsher environments.\n\nThe research will utilize a combination of classic genetics, the latest genomics technologies, and population genetics analysis. The study will be carried out using broad geographical collections from natural herbariums and museums. The research activities will include mapping the natural variation of unreduced gametes rates to expose genetic and environmental predispositions to polyploidy, comparing recombination and selection across ploidies to reveal stabilizing mechanics in polyploids, and reconstructing introgression patterns to uncover the recovery processes of polyploid populations.\n\nDespite the low survival rate of most new polyploids, evidence suggests that polyploidy can confer an adaptive advantage, particularly during times of extreme climate change. This research is poised to deliver groundbreaking advances by deciphering the mechanisms leading to successful polyploidization across the plant and animal kingdoms. The outcomes will have significant relevance for understanding speciation bursts, evolutionary inventions, and the potential for using polyploidy in crop improvement and medical applications.\n\n(Word Count: 252)",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, titled \"The Basic Principles of Polyploidy in Plants and Animals,\" aims to unravel the complexity of polyploidy – the occurrence of more than two sets of chromosomes in eukaryotic organisms due to whole-genome duplication (WGD). This phenomenon, which is intricately linked with speciation bursts and evolutionary novelties, holds significant adaptive advantages, particularly in times of extreme climate change. Despite these advantages, the survival rate of new polyploid entities is low, and their success stories are rare. \n\nOur cross-disciplinary approach will involve comprehensive research on two species complexes: Arabidopsis lyrata, a plant from the Northern Hemisphere, and Neobatrachus, a burrowing frog from the Australian desert. Using a combination of classic genetics, cutting-edge genomics technologies, and population genetics analysis, we will conduct studies with specimens from natural herbaria and museums. The geographic scope of our research is broad, encompassing diverse habitats that have historically fostered polyploidy.\n\nThe research will focus on three primary objectives: identifying the genetic and environmental factors that trigger polyploidy, understanding the mechanisms that enable the initial survival of polyploids, and elucidating the processes that stabilize and promote the success of polyploid populations. Our activities will include mapping natural variation of unreduced gametes rates, comparing recombination and selection across ploidies, and reconstructing introgression patterns to uncover polyploid populations' recovery processes after bottlenecks.\n\nThe impact of our findings will extend across multiple fields, including biology, agriculture, and medicine, providing groundbreaking advances in our understanding of genetic diversity, adaptation, and evolutionary processes. This research is poised to redefine our comprehension of polyploidy's role in shaping biodiversity and resilience in changing environments."

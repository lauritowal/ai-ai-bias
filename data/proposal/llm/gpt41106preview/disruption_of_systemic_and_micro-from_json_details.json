        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Disruption of systemic and microenvironmental barriers to immunotherapy of antigenic tumors,\" seeks to address the critical challenge of immunotherapy resistance in HPV-induced cancers, which encode immunogenic neo-antigens yet remain unresponsive to current immunotherapeutic approaches. The primary goal is to investigate and dismantle the multifaceted barriers which impede cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induction, infiltration, and subsequent killing of cancer cells.\n\nDespite encoding immunogenic neo-antigens, HPV-induced cancers demonstrate a lack of efficacy to immunotherapy, primarily due to pre-existing and adaptive resistance mechanisms. Our hypothesis suggests that multiple systemic and microenvironmental barriers established by HPV-induced cancers thwart CTL responses. These include systemic antigen-nonspecific immunosuppression and the expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells within the spleen, lymph nodes, and the tumor microenvironment itself.\n\nTo probe these barriers, our research will employ genetic and pharmacological strategies, utilizing mouse models of HPV-induced cancer. We aim to understand the role of oncogene-expressing keratinocytes in the expansion of myeloid cells and their subsequent impact on CD8 T cells and dendritic cells. Additionally, we will assess the therapeutic potential of combining barrier-breaking strategies with immuno-stimulatory modalities.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include the generation of novel insights into the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy in HPV-induced cancers and establishing the groundwork for the development of more efficacious immunotherapeutic strategies against these refractory cancers. Our multi-pronged approach promises to advance the field of cancer immunotherapy research significantly, providing hope for improved treatments for patients with challenging HPV-related malignancies."

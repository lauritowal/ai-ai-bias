        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse\n\nThe rapid evolution of immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and digital games is blending the boundaries between the real and the virtual, creating a complex Media Multiverse. To navigate and comprehend these emergent realities, our project, \"A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse,\" proposes a pioneering investigation into the semiotic mechanisms that facilitate the translation of objects, spaces, and subjects across different realities. This study aims to advance empirical understanding, improve methodological capacity, and create a robust theoretical framework for these interreal translations.\n\nOur research objectives include the development of an analytical approach to grasp the current state of interreal translations (WP1), speculative exploration to critique underlying ideologies and envisage future possibilities within the media multiverse (WP2), and the synthesis of these approaches to establish a new academic discipline, Multiverse Studies (WP3). By combining methods from translation studies with speculative research, the project will offer a nuanced understanding of the dynamics shaping our interaction with multiple realities and their potential impact on the future of mediated experiences.\n\nExpected outcomes encompass a critical analysis of interreal translations, a comprehensive theoretical framework to aid future research within this domain, and the formalization of Multiverse Studies as a recognized academic discipline. This work promises to illuminate the complexities of the media multiverse and empower stakeholders to make informed decisions about the development and integration of immersive technologies into everyday life. Through a systematic exploration of interreal translations, this project will chart unexplored territory in the rapidly converging landscape of reality and virtuality.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse\n\nThis grant proposal introduces “InterReal,” a pioneering research project aimed at dissecting the complexities of ‘interreal translations’ within the burgeoning media multiverse. The project endeavors to decipher the semiotic mechanisms that facilitate the transfer of objects, spaces, and subjects between various realities, such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and the virtual worlds within digital games. By examining these translations, InterReal seeks to illuminate how they shape and will continue to influence our mediated future.\n\nThe objectives of InterReal are threefold: to advance the empirical understanding of interreal translations, to enhance methodological capacity for investigating these phenomena, and to establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for the media multiverse. The research methodology integrates traditional translation studies with speculative research to form a robust analytical and speculative synthesis. This approach will be executed through three work packages (WPs): WP1 will employ an analytical method to comprehend the current state of interreal translations; WP2 will utilize a speculative stance to critique existing ideologies and explore future possibilities within the media multiverse; WP3 will synthesize findings from the first two WPs to create the foundation for a novel academic discipline—Multiverse Studies.\n\nAnticipated outcomes of the project include a nuanced understanding of interreal translations, a critical analysis of the media multiverse's current and future trajectories, and the establishment of Multiverse Studies as a recognized discipline. Through its innovative combination of approaches, InterReal aspires to provide valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between different realities and their implications for society, culture, and technology.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse\n\nThe proposed research project, \"A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse,\" seeks to pioneer the empirical study and theoretical understanding of the mechanisms behind translations among various forms of reality, specifically Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and the virtual worlds within digital games. Through the analytical and speculative examination of these interreal translations, this project aspires to elucidate the potential impacts on future mediated realities.\n\nThe central objectives of the project are to advance the empirical understanding of interreal translations, enhance methodological capacity for their study, and establish a theoretical framework for the media multiverse, thereby laying the groundwork for a new academic discipline: Multiverse Studies. The methodology integrates translation studies with speculative research, employing a three-pronged approach. Work Package 1 (WP1) focuses on an analytical approach to comprehend the current state of interreal translations. Work Package 2 (WP2) applies speculative methods to challenge existing ideologies and explore future possibilities within the media multiverse. Finally, Work Package 3 (WP3) synthesizes the insights gained from WP1 and WP2 to formalize the Multiverse Studies discipline.\n\nExpected outcomes include a nuanced understanding of interreal translations, a critical analysis of the media multiverse's current and potential ideologies, and the establishment of Multiverse Studies as a distinct field of inquiry. This project promises to illuminate the complex interactions between various realities and contribute to a more comprehensive view of our increasingly digitized and augmented world. The findings will be of great interest to scholars, media practitioners, and anyone engaged with the evolving landscape of virtual and augmented experiences.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse\n\nThe ever-evolving Media Multiverse—an intricate web of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and digital gaming worlds—presents uncharted territories in the realm of translation studies. Our project, \"A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse,\" proposes an ambitious investigation into the semiotic mechanisms that enable the transfer of objects, spaces, and subjects across these diverse realities. This initiative is poised to revolutionize our empirical understanding of interreal translations and contribute to the nascent field of Multiverse Studies.\n\nOur primary objectives include advancing empirical knowledge of interreal translations, enhancing methodological capacity to study these phenomena, and creating a robust theoretical framework for the media multiverse. To achieve these goals, we will employ a combination of analytical and speculative research methods. This multidisciplinary approach will facilitate a nuanced comprehension of existing interreal translations while simultaneously forecasting future trajectories within the media multiverse.\n\nThe project's methodology unfolds across three distinct yet interrelated work packages (WPs). WP1 will deploy an analytical approach to dissect the current state of interreal translations. WP2 will engage in speculative exploration, critiquing prevailing ideologies and envisaging future possibilities of the media multiverse. WP3 will synthesize insights from WP1 and WP2, aiming to establish Multiverse Studies as a formal discipline.\n\nExpected outcomes from this project include a sophisticated understanding of interreal translations, critical analysis of the implications for our mediated reality, and the formation of a new academic discipline dedicated to the Media Multiverse. This groundbreaking research has the potential to inform future technological developments and cultural productions, shaping the way we interact with and perceive the layered realities of our world."

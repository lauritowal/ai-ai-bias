        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse\n\nThe ever-evolving Media Multiverse—an intricate web of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and digital gaming worlds—presents uncharted territories in the realm of translation studies. Our project, \"A Systematic Exploration of Interreal Translations in the Media Multiverse,\" proposes an ambitious investigation into the semiotic mechanisms that enable the transfer of objects, spaces, and subjects across these diverse realities. This initiative is poised to revolutionize our empirical understanding of interreal translations and contribute to the nascent field of Multiverse Studies.\n\nOur primary objectives include advancing empirical knowledge of interreal translations, enhancing methodological capacity to study these phenomena, and creating a robust theoretical framework for the media multiverse. To achieve these goals, we will employ a combination of analytical and speculative research methods. This multidisciplinary approach will facilitate a nuanced comprehension of existing interreal translations while simultaneously forecasting future trajectories within the media multiverse.\n\nThe project's methodology unfolds across three distinct yet interrelated work packages (WPs). WP1 will deploy an analytical approach to dissect the current state of interreal translations. WP2 will engage in speculative exploration, critiquing prevailing ideologies and envisaging future possibilities of the media multiverse. WP3 will synthesize insights from WP1 and WP2, aiming to establish Multiverse Studies as a formal discipline.\n\nExpected outcomes from this project include a sophisticated understanding of interreal translations, critical analysis of the implications for our mediated reality, and the formation of a new academic discipline dedicated to the Media Multiverse. This groundbreaking research has the potential to inform future technological developments and cultural productions, shaping the way we interact with and perceive the layered realities of our world."

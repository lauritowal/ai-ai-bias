        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Financing Frictions in High-Potential Entrepreneurship\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the critical economic challenge of access to capital for high-potential entrepreneurship, as recognized under the EU's Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan. Recognizing entrepreneurship as a key driver of economic growth, the project aims to quantify and elucidate financing frictions that thwart the progress of startups, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and science-based tough tech ventures. With a central policy priority on overcoming these hurdles, the project will investigate three main areas: the character of financing sources and constraints, the adaptation of venture capital (VC) funding models for tough tech ventures, and the dynamics of agglomeration in emerging industries including the impact of capital markets policy.\n\nThe project's goals are to drive employment, enhance productivity growth, and to specifically address and overcome financing challenges that high-potential entrepreneurs face. It will also assess the impact of capital markets policy on technology clusters, offering insights to tailor policy reforms that are conducive to businesses with high growth potential. The misalignment in current policy, which often invokes Silicon-Valley-type VC models for small businesses with low growth potential, will be critically examined, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of financing constraints for startups and SMEs.\n\nBy providing a clear analysis of financing constraints and developing tailored solutions, this project anticipates to make significant contributions to academic research and policy development, fostering an environment where high-potential entrepreneurship can flourish within the EU."

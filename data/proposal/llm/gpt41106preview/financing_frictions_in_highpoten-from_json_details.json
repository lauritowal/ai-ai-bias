        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Financing Frictions in High-Potential Entrepreneurship,\" aims to address the critical challenge of access to capital faced by startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that hold the potential to drive significant economic growth. Recognizing entrepreneurship as a key driver of economic advancement and a central policy priority, this project aligns with the EU's Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan and seeks to investigate and resolve the opaque financing constraints that currently impede the progress of high-growth ventures, particularly in the context of emerging industries and 'tough tech' ventures.\n\nDespite the acknowledged importance of entrepreneurship, the academic and policy discourse lacks clarity on the specific financing hurdles faced by high-potential businesses. This project intends to quantify these frictions and explore the misalignments in policy that often lead to the inappropriate application of Silicon Valley-style venture capital models to smaller businesses with lower growth potential. Through a focus on three key areas of inquiry—characterization of financing sources and constraints, development of adapted venture capital funding models for science-based ventures, and understanding the dynamics of agglomeration in emerging industries—the project will provide actionable insights for policy reforms tailored to businesses poised for high growth.\n\nThe goals of this project extend beyond academic interest, aiming to drive employment, increase productivity growth, and specifically overcome financing hurdles. By examining the impact of capital markets policy on technology clusters, the project aspires to contribute to a more nuanced and effective policy framework that supports the flourishing of high-potential entrepreneurship across the EU.",
        "Abstract:\n\nEntrepreneurship is widely recognized as a catalyst for economic advancement, and the EU's Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan has underscored its importance. However, high-potential startups and SMEs face significant challenges in accessing capital, which is a critical barrier to their growth and, consequently, to economic development. The proposed project, \"Financing Frictions in High-Potential Entrepreneurship,\" aims to thoroughly examine and mitigate the obstacles that these enterprises encounter in securing funding.\n\nThis research initiative will delve into the nature of financing sources and constraints for high-potential entrepreneurs, particularly within the context of the EU. It seeks to adapt the venture capital funding model to better suit 'tough tech' ventures that require more nuanced investment strategies. Further, the project will explore the dynamics of agglomeration in emerging industries and analyze the influence of capital markets policy on technology clusters.\n\nThe core goal of this proposal is to drive employment, enhance productivity growth, and overcome specific financing hurdles that stifle innovation and expansion. By quantifying and addressing the financing frictions faced by dynamic startups and SMEs, the project will provide valuable insights and recommendations for policy reforms tailored to businesses with high growth potential. The outcome is expected to foster a more conducive financial environment for entrepreneurship, ultimately contributing to the EU's economic vigor and competitiveness.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Financing Frictions in High-Potential Entrepreneurship,\" addresses a critical barrier to economic growth: the challenge of access to capital for startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with significant growth potential. Despite the recognition of entrepreneurship as a key driver of economic expansion and a central policy priority within the European Union, as outlined in the EU's Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan, there remains a gap in understanding the specific financing constraints faced by high-potential ventures, particularly those in science-based and technology-focused sectors.\n\nThe project aims to quantify and clarify the financing frictions experienced by such businesses, examining the misalignment in current policy applications that often inappropriately invoke Silicon Valley-type venture capital (VC) models for smaller businesses with lower growth potential. The research will focus on characterizing the sources of financing and the constraints these high-potential entrepreneurs encounter, developing adaptations to the VC funding model suitable for 'tough tech' ventures, and understanding the dynamics of agglomeration in emerging industries as well as the impact of capital markets policy.\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of these areas, the project strives to drive employment, productivity growth, and overcome specific financing hurdles. The outcomes are expected to inform policy reforms tailored to the unique needs of high-growth potential businesses, fostering a more robust entrepreneurship ecosystem within the EU.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Financing Frictions in High-Potential Entrepreneurship\n\nThis grant proposal addresses the critical economic challenge of access to capital for high-potential entrepreneurship, as recognized under the EU's Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan. Recognizing entrepreneurship as a key driver of economic growth, the project aims to quantify and elucidate financing frictions that thwart the progress of startups, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and science-based tough tech ventures. With a central policy priority on overcoming these hurdles, the project will investigate three main areas: the character of financing sources and constraints, the adaptation of venture capital (VC) funding models for tough tech ventures, and the dynamics of agglomeration in emerging industries including the impact of capital markets policy.\n\nThe project's goals are to drive employment, enhance productivity growth, and to specifically address and overcome financing challenges that high-potential entrepreneurs face. It will also assess the impact of capital markets policy on technology clusters, offering insights to tailor policy reforms that are conducive to businesses with high growth potential. The misalignment in current policy, which often invokes Silicon-Valley-type VC models for small businesses with low growth potential, will be critically examined, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of financing constraints for startups and SMEs.\n\nBy providing a clear analysis of financing constraints and developing tailored solutions, this project anticipates to make significant contributions to academic research and policy development, fostering an environment where high-potential entrepreneurship can flourish within the EU."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Smart Monitoring, Inspection and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines\" seeks to address the excessive energy consumption and sustainability challenges faced by wind turbines (WTs) across Europe. With wind energy positioned as the leading renewable source, the initiative targets the prevalent issue of WTs' short life-span and the lack of efficient management schemes. Current life-cycle assessment methodologies are outdated, and standard inspection methods, such as visual inspection and offline non-destructive evaluation, are not sophisticated enough to meet the demands of rapidly aging WTs.\n\nThe project proposes to establish a smart framework that guides WT operators in managing their assets from cradle-to-grave. This will involve the development of a new monitoring paradigm that integrates structural response information fusion, advanced simulations of influential factors such as structure-foundation-soil interaction, and fatigue, as well as a stochastic framework capable of detecting anomalies on both short-term (damage) and long-term (deterioration) scales. \n\nThe envisioned end goal is to deliver a comprehensive \"protection-suit\" for WTs, which will include an innovative hardware sensor solution and a modular software package titled \"ETH-WINDMIL.\" This suite will redefine the status quo in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, ensuring that WTs are monitored and managed more effectively and sustainably. \n\nThe project capitalizes on the Principal Investigator's (PI) extensive background in structural monitoring, quantification of the value of information, and engineering practice. By harnessing affordable sensor technology, advanced numerical modeling, and sophisticated data processing tools, this project aims to establish a minimal intervention principle that extends the life and enhances the efficiency of WTs, thereby playing a crucial role in the future of sustainable energy management.",
        "Abstract:\n\nWith the increasing focus on sustainable energy, wind energy has come to the forefront as a leading renewable source. However, the industry faces challenges such as the short life-span of wind turbines (WTs) and a lack of efficient management schemes, primarily because current life-cycle assessment methodologies are outdated and the tools for structural health monitoring are not mature enough. To address these issues, our project, \"Smart Monitoring, Inspection and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines,\" proposes to establish a smart framework tailored to the European context that will revolutionize the way WTs are managed from cradle-to-grave.\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop reliable life-cycle assessment methodologies and to redefine the status quo in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. By employing affordable sensor technology, advanced numerical modeling, and sophisticated data processing tools, we intend to create a minimally invasive, smart monitoring paradigm. This will involve the fusion of structural response information and simulations of influential factors, such as structure-foundation-soil interaction and fatigue, within a stochastic framework capable of detecting anomalies on both short- and long-term scales.\n\nOur end goal is to deliver a comprehensive protection-suit for WTs, which includes a sensor solution hardware and a modular software package, entitled ETH-WINDMIL. This software will not only guide wind turbine operators in asset management but also quantify the value of information in engineering practice, thereby enhancing the longevity and efficiency of wind energy infrastructure.\n\nThe project will build upon the structural monitoring work and expertise of the principal investigator (PI), who has an established background in quantifying the value of information and its practical applications in engineering. By integrating these components, the project promises to significantly impact the renewable energy sector by improving the life-cycle management of wind turbines and establishing new norms for their operation and maintenance.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Smart Monitoring, Inspection, and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines\n\nWith wind energy at the forefront of leading renewable energy sources, the proposed project, \"Smart Monitoring, Inspection, and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines,\" aims to tackle the excessive energy consumption issue through the establishment of an innovative framework for the efficient management and extended longevity of wind turbines (WTs). Current wind turbine management is plagued by shortcomings such as short life-spans and outdated life-cycle assessment methodologies. The proposed project will focus specifically on the European region where many WTs are reaching the end of their design span.\n\nThe project aims to develop a smart framework that guides WT operators in asset management from cradle-to-grave. This will be achieved by leveraging affordable sensor technology, advanced numerical modeling, and sophisticated data processing tools. The approach introduces a new monitoring paradigm that relies on the fusion of structural response information. Simulations will consider influential factors such as structure-foundation-soil interaction and fatigue, integrated within a stochastic framework for detecting anomalies on both short-term (damage) and long-term (deterioration) scales.\n\nThe end goal is to deliver a comprehensive protection-suit for WTs, consisting of a hardware (sensor) solution and a modular software package titled \"ETH-WINDMIL.\" This package promises to redefine the status quo in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems by providing a minimal intervention principle and enhancing current inspection methods which are limited to visual inspection and offline non-destructive evaluation.\n\nThe project leverages the principal investigator's (PI) background in structural monitoring, quantification of the value of information, and engineering practice, promising to elevate the current tools and norms to mature, reliable life-cycle assessment methodologies. The successful execution of this project will not only improve sustainable resource management but will also redefine engineering practices for wind turbine asset management, ensuring a sustainable and efficient future for wind energy.\n\nKeywords: Wind Turbines, Life-Cycle Assessment, Smart Framework, Sensor Technology, Structural Monitoring, SCADA Systems, Renewable Energy Management, Europe.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Smart Monitoring, Inspection and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines\" (SMILC-WT) addresses the pressing need for enhanced operational longevity and efficient management of wind turbines (WTs), a leading source of renewable energy. Despite their significance, WTs are plagued by a short lifespan and outdated management strategies that compromise energy production and sustainability.\n\nSMILC-WT proposes a pioneering framework for the comprehensive life-cycle assessment of WTs, from cradle to grave, to counteract these shortcomings. The framework integrates affordable sensor technology, advanced numerical modeling, and sophisticated data processing tools to establish a new monitoring paradigm. This paradigm will leverage the fusion of structural response information, enabling the simulation of influential factors such as structure-foundation-soil interaction and fatigue. A stochastic framework will be developed for detecting anomalies on both short-term (damage) and long-term (deterioration) scales.\n\nThe anticipated outcome is the delivery of a \"protection-suit\" for WTs, consisting of a cutting-edge hardware sensor solution and a modular software package, entitled ETH-WINDMIL. This solution is set to redefine the status quo in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems by providing WT operators with actionable insights for asset management and by quantifying the value of information in engineering practice.\n\nThe project builds upon the principal investigator's (PI) extensive background in structural monitoring and is underpinned by the principle of minimal intervention to ensure a sustainable resource management approach. With a focus on Europe, SMILC-WT is poised to revolutionize the wind energy sector by offering a comprehensive solution to the existing energy consumption issues and setting a new standard for the life-cycle management of wind energy assets."

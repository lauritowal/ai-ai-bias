        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Smart Monitoring, Inspection and Life-Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbines\" (SMILC-WT) addresses the pressing need for enhanced operational longevity and efficient management of wind turbines (WTs), a leading source of renewable energy. Despite their significance, WTs are plagued by a short lifespan and outdated management strategies that compromise energy production and sustainability.\n\nSMILC-WT proposes a pioneering framework for the comprehensive life-cycle assessment of WTs, from cradle to grave, to counteract these shortcomings. The framework integrates affordable sensor technology, advanced numerical modeling, and sophisticated data processing tools to establish a new monitoring paradigm. This paradigm will leverage the fusion of structural response information, enabling the simulation of influential factors such as structure-foundation-soil interaction and fatigue. A stochastic framework will be developed for detecting anomalies on both short-term (damage) and long-term (deterioration) scales.\n\nThe anticipated outcome is the delivery of a \"protection-suit\" for WTs, consisting of a cutting-edge hardware sensor solution and a modular software package, entitled ETH-WINDMIL. This solution is set to redefine the status quo in Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems by providing WT operators with actionable insights for asset management and by quantifying the value of information in engineering practice.\n\nThe project builds upon the principal investigator's (PI) extensive background in structural monitoring and is underpinned by the principle of minimal intervention to ensure a sustainable resource management approach. With a focus on Europe, SMILC-WT is poised to revolutionize the wind energy sector by offering a comprehensive solution to the existing energy consumption issues and setting a new standard for the life-cycle management of wind energy assets."

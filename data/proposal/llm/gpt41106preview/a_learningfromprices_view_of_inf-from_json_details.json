        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Learning-from-Prices View of Inflation and Business Cycles\n\nThe proposed research project aims to uncover the critical role of households' inflation perceptions in shaping the business cycles within the Eurozone, an area currently experiencing a sharp increase in inflation rates. This project will explore how inflation expectations, the persistence of inflation, and the cost of monetary tightening are influenced by a novel feedback loop where market prices affect consumers' perceived inflation, leading to significant implications for the transmission of monetary policy.\n\nAt the heart of the proposal is the household-centric view of money non-neutrality, which challenges conventional economic theories by positing that consumers' price hunting and learning from market prices are pivotal in understanding the co-movement of output and inflation. This perspective directly responds to the recent trend among central banks to prioritize the monitoring of consumers' inflation expectations.\n\nThe project will be executed through five interrelated working packages (WPs). WP1 will develop a new theory on output-inflation co-movement based on consumers' active search for price information. WP2 and WP3 will involve the empirical validation of the proposed mechanisms using extensive consumer spending and retail trade data. In WP4, we will construct a new model that captures how consumers learn from inflation about future economic prospects. Finally, WP5 will estimate this model using carefully curated survey data.\n\nExpected outcomes include a better understanding of consumers' expectations and the identification of empirical counterparts for incomplete information sets, which are currently a by-product of existing models. This research promises to offer theoretical and empirical support for a new channel through which inflation influences business activity, providing policymakers with enhanced tools to address inflation dynamics and their effects on the economy.\n\nKeywords: Inflation Expectations, Business Cycles, Eurozone, Monetary Policy, Household Perception, Economic Modelling",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"A Learning-from-Prices view of Inflation and Business Cycles,\" aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between inflation perceptions and business cycle dynamics in the Eurozone, which is currently experiencing a sharp increase in inflation. This innovative research proposes a household-centric view, challenging the traditional notion of money neutrality by suggesting that consumers' perceptions of inflation, shaped by market prices, play a crucial role in driving economic fluctuations.\n\nThe project will delve into the intricacies of inflation expectations, their persistence, and the implications of monetary policy tightening. It seeks to offer both theoretical and empirical support for a new channel of influence â€” the feedback loop between market outcomes and consumer expectations through prices. This approach is novel in its focus on how market prices impact consumers' perceived inflation and, consequently, their economic behaviors.\n\nThe research methodology is organized into five working packages (WPs). WP1 will develop a new theory on output-inflation co-movement based on consumers' price hunting behaviors. WP2 and WP3 are dedicated to validating the proposed mechanism using comprehensive consumer spending and retail trade data, respectively. WP4 will introduce a new model that captures how consumers learn from inflation about future economic prospects. Finally, WP5 will estimate this model using survey data to assess consumers' expectations.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a better appraisal of consumers' inflation expectations and the identification of empirical counterparts for incomplete information sets, offering valuable insights for policymakers. By understanding the interplay between inflation perceptions and market prices, this research could significantly influence the Eurozone's approach to managing inflation and business cycles, with a particular emphasis on the role of households in monetary policy transmission.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"A Learning-from-Prices view of Inflation and Business Cycles\" aims to unravel the intricate relationship between households' inflation perceptions and the dynamic nature of business cycles in the Eurozone, particularly under the current climate of sharply rising inflation. This research seeks to provide both theoretical and empirical support for a novel channel through which market prices shape consumers' expectations of inflation, thereby influencing their economic decisions and the overall transmission of monetary policy.\n\nAt the heart of the proposal is a household-centric view of money non-neutrality, which posits that consumers' price sensitivity and information gathering (price hunting) can lead to co-movements between output and inflation. Our approach leverages this perspective to explain the persistent nature of inflation and the potential costs associated with monetary tightening.\n\nThe research consists of five working packages (WPs) that systematically build the framework of analysis. WP1 will develop a new theory on output-inflation co-movement grounded in consumers' price hunting behaviors. WP2 and WP3 will validate this mechanism using consumer spending and retail trade data, respectively. WP4 will introduce a new model that encapsulates how consumers learn from inflation about future economic prospects. Lastly, WP5 will estimate this model based on survey data, aiming to offer identifiable empirical counterparts for hitherto incomplete information sets.\n\nA key novelty of this project is the study of the feedback loop between market outcomes and expectations via prices, which has been understudied despite its potential significance in understanding the full impact of inflation on business cycles. Additionally, the project aligns with central banks' growing interest in the role of consumers' expectations, offering valuable insights that could refine monetary policy strategies.\n\nExpected outcomes include a better appraisal of consumers' expectations, more robust theoretical grounding for the non-neutrality of money from a household perspective, and enhanced empirical models capturing the complexity of inflation dynamics. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of economic fluctuations and the design of more effective policy responses in the Eurozone. \n\nWord Count: 296",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Learning-from-Prices View of Inflation and Business Cycles\n\nThe proposed research project aims to explore a novel perspective on the relationship between inflation and business cycles within the Eurozone, a region currently experiencing a sharp increase in inflation. Titled \"A Learning-from-Prices view of Inflation and Business Cycles,\" the project focuses on how inflation expectations, the persistence of inflation, and the costs of monetary tightening interact to influence business activity, with a particular emphasis on the role of households.\n\nThe central hypothesis is that market prices serve as a critical source of information for consumers, shaping their perceptions of inflation and thus playing a key role in the transmission of monetary policy. This household-centric view of money non-neutrality suggests a feedback loop between observed market outcomes and inflation expectations through the mechanism of price signals, which has been largely overlooked in conventional models.\n\nTo investigate this hypothesis, the project is structured into five working packages (WPs). WP1 will develop a new theoretical framework to explain the co-movement of output and inflation based on consumers' price hunting activities. WP2 and WP3 will provide empirical validation of this mechanism using consumer spending and retail trade data, respectively. WP4 will propose a new model depicting how consumers learn from inflation about future economic prospects. Finally, WP5 will involve the estimation of this model using survey data.\n\nExpected outcomes include a better understanding of consumers' inflation expectations and the identification of empirical counterparts for incomplete information sets, offering valuable insights for policymakers. By studying the interaction between market prices and inflation expectations, the project aims to contribute to the broader discourse on the effectiveness of central banks' focus on managing consumers' expectations, with the ultimate goal of informing the design of monetary policy in the face of inflationary pressures."

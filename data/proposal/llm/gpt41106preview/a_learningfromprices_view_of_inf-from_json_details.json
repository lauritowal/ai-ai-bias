        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Learning-from-Prices View of Inflation and Business Cycles\n\nThe proposed research project aims to explore a novel perspective on the relationship between inflation and business cycles within the Eurozone, a region currently experiencing a sharp increase in inflation. Titled \"A Learning-from-Prices view of Inflation and Business Cycles,\" the project focuses on how inflation expectations, the persistence of inflation, and the costs of monetary tightening interact to influence business activity, with a particular emphasis on the role of households.\n\nThe central hypothesis is that market prices serve as a critical source of information for consumers, shaping their perceptions of inflation and thus playing a key role in the transmission of monetary policy. This household-centric view of money non-neutrality suggests a feedback loop between observed market outcomes and inflation expectations through the mechanism of price signals, which has been largely overlooked in conventional models.\n\nTo investigate this hypothesis, the project is structured into five working packages (WPs). WP1 will develop a new theoretical framework to explain the co-movement of output and inflation based on consumers' price hunting activities. WP2 and WP3 will provide empirical validation of this mechanism using consumer spending and retail trade data, respectively. WP4 will propose a new model depicting how consumers learn from inflation about future economic prospects. Finally, WP5 will involve the estimation of this model using survey data.\n\nExpected outcomes include a better understanding of consumers' inflation expectations and the identification of empirical counterparts for incomplete information sets, offering valuable insights for policymakers. By studying the interaction between market prices and inflation expectations, the project aims to contribute to the broader discourse on the effectiveness of central banks' focus on managing consumers' expectations, with the ultimate goal of informing the design of monetary policy in the face of inflationary pressures."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Re-thinking Efficiency in Deep Learning under Accelerators and commodity and processors\" (REDIAL) represents a transformative approach to enhancing the efficiency of deep learning technologies. Deep learning, while pivotal in breakthroughs across various domains such as face recognition, autonomous driving, and language translation, grapples with significant challenges including high resource demands, slow field advancement, and limited global research participation. REDIAL addresses these issues head-on by aiming to reduce training costs and time, and to enable effective model deployment on resource-constrained devices.\n\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, REDIAL will pursue a twofold strategy: firstly, to build a robust theoretical understanding of deep learning efficiency, and secondly, to develop novel architectures as well as training and inference methods tailored for both accelerators and commodity processors. Specific challenges targeted include overcoming dependencies that prevent parallelization and minimizing excessive on-chip data movement, which are critical barriers to efficiency. Additionally, the project seeks to leverage opportunities such as the adoption of analog processing within accelerators to further enhance performance.\n\nThe anticipated outputs of REDIAL are manifold, with the creation of new deep learning architectures and the formulation of algorithms that exhibit high efficiency properties being central to the project's success. These outputs are expected to result in revolutionary efficiency improvements that will not only reduce the costs and time associated with training deep learning models but also democratize the deployment of these models on devices with limited computational capabilities.\n\nUltimately, REDIAL aspires to fundamentally change the way the world trains and deploys deep learning models, particularly on constrained devices. By addressing these core efficiency challenges, the project aims to catalyze a significant leap forward in machine learning innovation, with far-reaching implications for both the research community and the broader technological landscape."

    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe question of what constitutes \"good attention\" is at the forefront of numerous debates surrounding social media, public health, and politics. Yet, despite its prevalence, there is a significant gap in the philosophical understanding of attention norms and how they should be conceptualized and regulated. The project GOODATTENTION seeks to fill this void through an innovative and interdisciplinary approach that bridges psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, decision theory, epistemology, and ethics.\n\nGOODATTENTION proposes to study the normative structure of attention, which has been largely overlooked by the philosophical community. By utilizing a novel conceptual framework centered on priority structures within the mind, the project aims to establish a foundational understanding of attention norms. This involves exploring the emergence of these norms at the individual psychological level as well as within the social sphere and integrating them into normative philosophy for evaluation.\n\nThe project hypothesizes that relevance is the key norm underpinning attention. To this end, GOODATTENTION will delve into the biological function of relevance processing, the influence of social relevance on attention guided by social norms, and the implications of attention norms for decision-making, epistemic judgment, and ethical considerations.\n\nWith its comprehensive scope, GOODATTENTION aspires to make a significant impact on various philosophical fields by demonstrating how they can incorporate attention norms into their discourse. The research will synthesize insights from evolutionary biology, cognitive and social psychology, linguistics, economics, and political theory. Ultimately, the analytical framework developed by GOODATTENTION will not only advance academic understanding but also serve as a valuable resource for policy development concerning attention in the digital age."

Much public discussion about social media, public health, and political debates is focused on versions of this question. What deserves our attention and how we should regulate attention in the face of distraction occupies the debate. What is missing is a philosophical investigation of attention norms and a framework for thinking about them. This is what GOODATTENTION provides. While entire fields of philosophy investigate the normative assessment of other aspects of the mind, the normative structure of attention remains largely unstudied. In its ground-breaking and interdisciplinary approach GOODATTENTION connects the study of the nature and the causal role of attention in psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics with the philosophical fields of decision theory, epistemology, and ethics. It develops a unified foundation for the study of attention norms by using a novel conceptual framework based on priority structures that organize the mind. It aims, first, to understand how attention norms emerge within our individual psychology and in the social domain. And it aims, second, to evaluate attention norms by integrating them into normative philosophy. The project's hypothesis is that the fundamental norms of attention concern relevance. GOODATTENTION investigates the biological function of relevance processing and the role of social relevance for how attention is guided by social norms. Building on this investigation, GOODATTENTION considers the role of attention norms for relevance in decision making, and in epistemic and ethical considerations. GOODATTENTION will impact these philosophical fields by showing how they can integrate norms of attention. It unifies research in evolutionary biology, cognitive and social psychology, linguistics, economics, and political theory. Its investigation of the epistemic role of attention and ethical rights and duties regarding attention will provide an analytical framework as input for policy making.",

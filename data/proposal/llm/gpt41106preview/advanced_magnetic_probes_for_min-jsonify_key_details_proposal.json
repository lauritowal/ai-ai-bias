Traditionally, these instruments rely on manual operation and tendon-driven mechanisms, limiting precision and effectiveness. Magnetic actuation of endovascular instruments offers an innovative and highly efficient steering option. Magnetic flexible instruments provide clinicians remarkable dexterity, even in deep-seated regions, while maintaining minimal access. Consequently, these instruments enable a spectrum of advanced surgical interventions otherwise unattainable. However, for remote actuation, these instruments rely on notably large external magnetic fields generated from outside the human body. Thus, the overarching aim of APOLLO is to develop and evaluate a flexible probe suitable for clinical use, capable of generating internal fields with shape-optimized magnetic materials, achieving an unprecedented level of dexterity. The APOLLO system is set to be a pivotal enabling technology, revolutionizing the clinical adoption of magnetic surgical instruments. It will transform MIS, introducing advanced diagnosis and treatment options. The APOLLO system will feature a sensor-equipped probe, integrating biocompatible magnetic materials and shape sensors, all orchestrated by dedicated control software to ensure precise steerability. Consequently, APOLLO will meet clinicians' needs, enhancing the effectiveness and accessibility of MIS. It will be an indispensable clinical tool, enabling precise and comprehensive surgical interventions in challenging, anatomically inaccessible regions of the human body, as well as accurate interventions in hard-to-reach regions. APOLLO aspires to turn magnetic actuation into a commercially successful technology. This endeavor involves forging strong industrial partnerships and a dedicated business development team, all propelled by an ambitious pursuit of success."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Next-Generation of Interior models of (Exo)planets\" (N-GINE), aims to significantly advance our understanding of the interior structure of giant planets, both within our solar system and beyond, and elucidate how these interiors affect planetary evolution, atmospheres, and observational signatures. Recognizing the importance of metals as tracers of gas giant formation, this groundbreaking project seeks to challenge and refine the current theoretical framework that posits a core with a homogeneous, well-mixed envelope, an assumption contradicted by recent data indicating non-homogeneous envelopes in Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nThe project's timeliness is underscored by the unprecedented availability of high-quality data from solar system giants provided by missions such as Cassini and Juno, and soon by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will offer exceptional insights into exoplanet atmospheres. Capitalizing on this unique opportunity, N-GINE will integrate data from these sources to develop sophisticated, self-consistent models that reflect the complexities of giant planet interiors.\n\nLed by a principal investigator with unrivaled expertise in exoplanet and solar system science, and supported by a dynamic team including three PhD students and two postdocs, N-GINE's ambitious deliverables include the first open-source retrieval tool for exoplanet interiors, the creation of a comprehensive database on refractory species in exoplanet atmospheres, and the application of Neural Networks for the development of innovative interior models.\n\nThe project's outcomes will have far-reaching impacts, affecting atmospheric chemical and retrieval calculations, and revolutionizing the interpretation of observational data from exoplanets. Ultimately, N-GINE promises to transform our understanding of planetary origins and evolution, providing the scientific community with powerful tools and models that will endure beyond the lifespan of the project."

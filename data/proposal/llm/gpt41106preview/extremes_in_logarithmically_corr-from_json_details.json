        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Extremes in logarithmically correlated fields,\" aims to forge a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the extremes of logarithmically correlated fields across both Gaussian and non-Gaussian setups. Featuring research subjects such as branching random walks, the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, and Ginzburg-Landau models, the project seeks to build upon recent advances in the study of the maximum and extremal processes. By employing methodologies like Gaussian comparisons and a refined second moment method, the proposal targets the development of innovative tools that are essential for a general theory applicable to a wide array of logarithmically correlated fields. The end goal is to not only enhance the understanding of these complex structures but also to extend their application to the realm of multiplicative chaos, thereby impacting a diverse range of mathematical and physical theories.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Extremes in logarithmically correlated fields,\" seeks funding to advance the mathematical comprehension of extremes in various logarithmically correlated field setups, encompassing both Gaussian and non-Gaussian models. The research will delve into phenomena within branching random walks, the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, uncovered points by random walks on the two-dimensional torus, the characteristic polynomial of random matrices, and Ginzburg-Landau models. Building upon recent progress in understanding the maximum and extremal processes in these fields, the project aims to develop robust analytical tools, utilizing methodologies such as Gaussian comparisons and a refined second moment method. The ultimate goal is to establish a general theory that can be applied to the study of extremal processes and multiplicative chaos, furthering our knowledge in this intricate area of mathematical research.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Extremes in Logarithmically Correlated Fields,\" seeks to advance the understanding of extremes in various contexts characterized by logarithmic correlation. The proposed research will focus on a range of setups, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian, and will encompass examples such as branching random walks, the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, coverage problems on the torus, the characteristic polynomial of random matrices, and Ginzburg-Landau models. Building upon recent progress, particularly studies of the maximum and the extremal process of the two-dimensional Gaussian free field facilitated by Gaussian comparisons and a refined second moment method, our project aims to develop a comprehensive and flexible theoretical framework applicable to general logarithmically correlated fields. The anticipated outcomes include a deeper study of extremes, the formulation of a general theory, and applications to multiplicative chaos, which have the potential to revolutionize the understanding of complex systems influenced by extreme events.",

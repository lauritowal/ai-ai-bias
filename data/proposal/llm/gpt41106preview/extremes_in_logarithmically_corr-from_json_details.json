        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Extremes in logarithmically correlated fields,\" seeks funding to advance the understanding of extremes in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian logarithmically correlated fields. The research will delve into a variety of examples, including branching random walks, the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, uncovering times by random walks on a two-dimensional torus, characteristic polynomials of random matrices, and Ginzburg-Landau models. Building on recent progress in studying the maximum and extremal process of the two-dimensional Gaussian free field, the project will employ Gaussian comparisons and a refined second moment method. The overarching goal is to develop a comprehensive and flexible theoretical framework that can be applied to a broad spectrum of logarithmically correlated fields, with particular applications to the concept of multiplicative chaos. This work promises to significantly contribute to the mathematical underpinnings of complex systems and disorder phenomena."

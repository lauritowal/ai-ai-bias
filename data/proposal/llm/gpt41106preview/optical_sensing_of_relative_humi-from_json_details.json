        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Optical sensing of relative humidity using photoswitchable molecules (OPTOSENSE)\n\nThe proposed project, OPTOSENSE, aims to develop a novel remote, all-optical detection scheme for the precise measurement of relative humidity and temperature, addressing the critical need for accurate environmental control in industries such as chemical engineering, pharmaceutical fabrication, and semiconductor device production. Current technologies rely on permittivity, polymer matrix adsorption, capacitance, and conductivity changes for sensing humidity; however, these methods often fall short in environments with electromagnetic interference, high-voltage electricity, or explosive atmospheres.\n\nOPTOSENSE overcomes these limitations by utilizing photoswitchable azobenzene compounds, specifically hydroxyazobenzene derivatives, within an optically transparent matrix. The mechanism is based on the sensitivity of these compounds to water molecules, exploiting the thermal cis-trans isomerization kinetics for measurement. This innovative approach allows for the simultaneous sensing of temperature and multiple hydrogen-bonding gases, further enhancing the utility of the system.\n\nThe project will integrate the sensing technology into a proof-of-concept device using optical fibers, which facilitates remote detection and reduces the risks associated with traditional sensing methods. One of the significant advantages of OPTOSENSE is its use of low-cost materials, making it a cost-effective solution for a wide range of applications.\n\nThe anticipated benefits of OPTOSENSE include simultaneous temperature and humidity sensing with high sensitivity and specificity, the ability to operate in challenging environments, and the potential for broad industrial applications. The development of this technology promises to significantly advance environmental monitoring and control in critical industrial processes.",

For distributing entanglement strong interactions between localized qubits (atoms) and flying qubits (photons) have to be ensured. The quantum-science community is currently searching for systems that offer enhanced light--matter interaction, as the efficiency of quantum operations in current state-of-the-art systems is limited by the interaction strength and loss mechanisms, which impede the generation of useful many-body entangled states. We plan to address this challenge by creating quantum metamaterials from quantum-emitter arrays as novel interfaces for generating atom-photon entanglement. Whereas most of the scientific effort focuses on coupling localized qubits to pre-designed structures to enhance interaction (i.e., cavities), we plan to take a completely different approach: building bottom-up quantum optical metamaterials out of quantum particles. We will achieve this by embedding silicon-vacancy-center arrays integrated in a diamond chip, which have shown to be top candidates for entanglement distribution. We will harness the enhanced collective response of the emitters to light and achieve a quantum response by coherently controlling the emitters' internal degrees of freedom. We will also access never-before-observed long-lived states, which are ideal for quantum memory. Our vision is to implement a scalable quantum light source with many degrees of freedom that generates large-scale atom-photon entanglement. By employing quantum information protocols we developed, our system can generate many-body entangled states applicable to one-way quantum computation. Our system unites major advantages for scaling-up entanglement: 1. High-fidelity quantum control over photonic states. 2. Potential operation-time speed-up by parallelizing photon control. 3. Quantum memory with long-lived states. 4. Integration into nanophotonics"

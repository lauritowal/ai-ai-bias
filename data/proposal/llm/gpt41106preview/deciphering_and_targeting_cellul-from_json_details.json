        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Deciphering and targeting cellular states in glioblastoma,\" aims to address the significant clinical challenge posed by the cellular heterogeneity of glioblastoma (GBM). Despite advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) over the past six years revealing multiple subpopulations within tumors, GBM remains a deadly brain cancer with limited treatment options. Building on these findings, our project seeks to deepen the understanding of GBM heterogeneity by characterizing the regulation of cellular states, identifying novel and potentially rare cellular states, and examining effective treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumors.\n\nOur first aim is to dissect the regulation of common cellular states that have been observed across GBM patients. We will employ cutting-edge techniques such as single cell ATAC-seq and spatial transcriptomics to analyze patient samples, animal models, and gliomasphere culture models. The second aim involves a comprehensive search for novel cellular states, including those associated with GBM invasiveness. The third aim is to translate our findings into clinical applications by examining strategies for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors. We will screen for state-specific drug sensitivities, induce state transitions, and develop rational combinations of therapies to target multiple co-existing states.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include an expanded knowledge base regarding cancer heterogeneity and the development of novel strategies to target heterogeneous tumors. Our integrative approach, combining patient-derived samples and advanced modeling systems, will provide significant insights into the complex biology of GBM and pave the way for more effective, personalized treatments for GBM patients.\n\nKeywords: glioblastoma, cellular heterogeneity, single cell sequencing, treatment strategies, tumor microenvironment.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Deciphering and Targeting Cellular States in Glioblastoma\n\nThe heterogeneity of cellular states within glioblastoma (GBM) tumors presents a significant challenge for effective treatment. Our project aims to characterize and target the diverse cellular composition of GBM to improve therapeutic strategies. Over the past six years, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed multiple subpopulations of cells within individual tumors, displaying patterns of heterogeneity consistent across patients. To build upon these findings, we propose three specific aims.\n\nAim 1 will dissect the regulation of common cellular states using single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. These methods will be applied to GBM patient samples, animal models, and gliomasphere culture models to understand the regulatory landscapes that define these states.\n\nAim 2 will search for novel cellular states, including rare and invasive states, by leveraging our established techniques and models. This will expand our understanding of GBM complexity and may unveil new therapeutic targets.\n\nAim 3 will examine strategies to treat heterogeneous tumors by screening for state-specific drug sensitivities, inducing state transitions, and developing rational combinations of treatments aimed at eradicating multiple co-existing states within the tumor.\n\nOur project objectives are to understand the regulation of cellular states, identify novel cellular states, and develop treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumors. We anticipate that our research will significantly expand knowledge of cancer heterogeneity and contribute to the development of strategies to target heterogeneous tumors effectively. This has the potential to pave the way for personalized medicine approaches in GBM, ultimately improving patient outcomes.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"Deciphering and Targeting Cellular States in Glioblastoma\" aims to address the critical challenge of cellular heterogeneity in glioblastoma (GBM), a feature that confounds effective treatment. Building on six years of research leveraging single cell RNA-seq, which highlighted the presence of multiple cell subpopulations within tumors, we propose a multifaceted approach to deepen our understanding and develop targeted therapies.\n\nOur first aim is to dissect the regulation of common cellular states identified across GBM tumors using cutting-edge techniques such as single cell ATAC-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics. By employing GBM patient samples, animal models, and gliomasphere culture models, we will map the epigenetic landscape and spatial organization of these states. The second aim is to conduct an exhaustive search for novel cellular states, particularly focusing on rare or invasive populations that contribute to the disease's aggressiveness and resistance to therapy.\n\nThe third aim pivots towards translational outcomes; we will examine therapeutic strategies tailored to treat GBM's heterogeneity. Our approaches include screening for state-specific drug sensitivities, utilizing drugs that can induce state transitions, and developing rational drug combinations aimed at eradicating multiple co-existing cellular states within tumors. Through these aims, we envision not only advancing our knowledge of cancer heterogeneity but also developing innovative strategies to target heterogeneous tumors.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research are significant, as they hold the promise of unveiling regulatory mechanisms behind GBM cellular states, discovering previously unrecognized cellular phenotypes, and informing the development of more effective, personalized treatment protocols for patients suffering from this devastating disease.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Deciphering and targeting cellular states in glioblastoma,\" seeks to advance our understanding of the cellular heterogeneity inherent in glioblastoma (GBM) and leverage this knowledge to develop novel therapeutic strategies. GBM is characterized by diverse cellular populations, which complicates treatment and contributes to its poor prognosis. Over the past six years, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed multiple cell subpopulations within tumors that resemble neurodevelopmental types, with distinct patterns of heterogeneity consistent across patients.\n\nThe primary objective of the project is to characterize these heterogeneous cellular states in GBM and devise innovative methods to target them therapeutically. Three specific aims will guide the research: (1) Dissect the regulation of common cellular states through single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and Spatial Transcriptomics. These techniques will be applied to GBM patient samples, animal models, and gliomasphere culture models, enhancing our understanding of the epigenomic and spatial landscape of GBM. (2) Search for novel cellular states, focusing on identification of rare or invasive states. (3) Examine treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumors, screening for state-specific drug sensitivities, and developing rational combinations of therapies to target multiple states simultaneously.\n\nThe project promises to expand our knowledge of cancer heterogeneity and establish a foundation for developing strategies to target heterogeneous tumors effectively. By exploring the regulatory mechanisms of cellular states, identifying new cellular states, and assessing treatment approaches, this research aims to offer significant clinical benefits for managing a notoriously challenging cancer.\n\nKeywords: glioblastoma, cellular heterogeneity, single-cell sequencing, treatment strategies, cancer research."

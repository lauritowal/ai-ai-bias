        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Deciphering and targeting cellular states in glioblastoma,\" seeks to advance our understanding of the cellular heterogeneity inherent in glioblastoma (GBM) and leverage this knowledge to develop novel therapeutic strategies. GBM is characterized by diverse cellular populations, which complicates treatment and contributes to its poor prognosis. Over the past six years, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed multiple cell subpopulations within tumors that resemble neurodevelopmental types, with distinct patterns of heterogeneity consistent across patients.\n\nThe primary objective of the project is to characterize these heterogeneous cellular states in GBM and devise innovative methods to target them therapeutically. Three specific aims will guide the research: (1) Dissect the regulation of common cellular states through single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and Spatial Transcriptomics. These techniques will be applied to GBM patient samples, animal models, and gliomasphere culture models, enhancing our understanding of the epigenomic and spatial landscape of GBM. (2) Search for novel cellular states, focusing on identification of rare or invasive states. (3) Examine treatment strategies for heterogeneous tumors, screening for state-specific drug sensitivities, and developing rational combinations of therapies to target multiple states simultaneously.\n\nThe project promises to expand our knowledge of cancer heterogeneity and establish a foundation for developing strategies to target heterogeneous tumors effectively. By exploring the regulatory mechanisms of cellular states, identifying new cellular states, and assessing treatment approaches, this research aims to offer significant clinical benefits for managing a notoriously challenging cancer.\n\nKeywords: glioblastoma, cellular heterogeneity, single-cell sequencing, treatment strategies, cancer research."

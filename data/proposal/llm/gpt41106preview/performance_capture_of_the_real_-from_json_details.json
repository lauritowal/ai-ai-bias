        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: \"Performance Capture of the Real World in Motion\"\n\nThe proposed project, \"Performance Capture of the Real World in Motion,\" seeks to revolutionize the field of performance capture by transcending the limitations of current technologies. Traditional methods are confined to indoor studios, necessitate controlled lighting, rely on dense static camera arrays, and are often restricted to capturing single objects with limited detail. Moreover, these methods are based on simplistic assumptions about materials, reflectance, and lighting, and they produce models that are not easily modifiable.\n\nOur project aims to pioneer a new generation of performance capture techniques that will facilitate the acquisition of dynamic surface and texture models with unprecedented shape detail from multi-view video. The objectives include the ability to succeed in general scenes outdoors and outside the lab, handle scenes with complex material and reflectance distributions, and operate in uncontrolled and unknown lighting conditions. Additionally, the project aims to capture dense and crowded scenes with complex shape deformations and reconstruct modifiable scene models, all while functioning with sparse and moving sets of cameras, including mobile devices such as smartphones.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this groundbreaking initiative are threefold: turning performance capture from a research technology into a practical, widely accessible tool; providing significant scientific insights into the complexities of real-world motion capture; and opening up revolutionary new applications across various fields such as film production, virtual reality, physical therapy, and beyond.\n\nBy leveraging sparse and mobile camera systems, the technology developed through this project promises to bring the power of high-fidelity, three-dimensional motion capture out of the studio and into the dynamic and unpredictable environments of the real world."

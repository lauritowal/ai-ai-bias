        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"Interdisciplinary research: Connecting complex plasmas with colloidal dispersions\" aims to bridge two distinct domains to advance the understanding of classical strongly coupled systems. By combining approaches from complex plasmas, which are virtually undamped at particle timescales, with colloidal dispersions, which are overdamped and can be controlled to reach equilibrium, this project intends to provide a comprehensive study at the individual-particle level. \n\nFully resolved 3D particle trajectories, tunable pair interactions, and the ability to manipulate particles individually or collectively are among the similar advantages leveraged by both systems. This unique synergy will allow for an in-depth exploration of mesoscopic processes in supercooled liquids, dynamical heterogeneity, and the evolutionary paths of crystal structure development. Additionally, the project will investigate defect dynamics, non-equilibrium phase transitions, and the dynamics at atomistic timescales, particularly focusing on phenomena such as lane formation in driven binary systems.\n\nFurther scientific objectives include examining phase separation in binary fluids, the role of pair interactions in demixing kinetics, and the transitions between spinodal decomposition and nucleation and growth regimes. The research also encompasses studying hydrodynamics at the discreteness limit and critical phenomena in particle systems. Here, the external fields will be used to tune the range and strength of interactions, allowing for the analysis of designed pair interactions and their influence on behavior.\n\nThis interdisciplinary endeavor promises to enhance our understanding of fundamental physical processes and has the potential to inform the development of new materials and technologies in various applied sciences."

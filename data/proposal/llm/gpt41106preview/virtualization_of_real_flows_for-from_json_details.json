        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Virtualization of Real Flows for Animation and Simulation\" project aims to transform the field of fluid dynamics simulations by addressing two critical challenges: the absence of practical technologies for capturing flow data and the complexities associated with resolving turbulence. The proposed research is strategically aligned with the needs of multiple industries, including engineering disciplines, aerodynamic body design, computer-generated environments, and visual effects in movies, which all demand sophisticated simulation capabilities.\n\nAt the heart of the project lies the development of novel data-centric approaches for fluid simulations that go beyond the current state-of-the-art methods. By designing algorithms that efficiently integrate physics solvers with motion reconstruction techniques from volumetric images, we intend to capture the intricate movements of fluid flows with unprecedented accuracy. Concurrently, our team will work on the construction of hierarchical space-time structures that offer a structured representation of complex flows, enabling powerful avenues for intuitive editing and interaction.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include the creation of robust and efficient data-driven fluid simulations, interactive design tools, and the application of these advancements in medical fields where physical constraints are paramount. Moreover, by shifting the paradigm to a data-centric workflow, this project has the potential to establish new standards for working with both synthetic and captured flow data.\n\nIf successful, the impact of our work will be significant, offering a comprehensive solution to the long-standing problems in fluid simulation and opening up new possibilities for innovation in a wide array of applications."

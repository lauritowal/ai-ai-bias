        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"The Gauge/Gravity Duality and Geometry in String Theory\"\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"The Gauge/Gravity Duality and Geometry in String Theory,\" aims to bridge the gap between quantum mechanics, which describes three subatomic forces, and general relativity, which describes gravity. The project centers on the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence, a conceptual breakthrough conjectured by Maldacena, which posits a duality suggesting that a quantum gauge theory in d dimensions is equivalent to a gravitational theory in (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. \n\nThe core objective of this proposal is to extend the gauge/gravity duality and innovate novel mathematical approaches, thereby advancing both physics and mathematics. The research encompasses a systematic study of AdS backgrounds within string theory, the development of generalised Sasaki-Einstein geometry, the analysis of supersymmetric gauge theories on curved manifolds, and the examination of gravity duals. Furthermore, it investigates dualities between pairs of gauge theories and studies related matrix models utilizing localisation techniques. A special focus is placed on the exploration of gauge/gravity duality in the context of quantum critical phenomena, with an overarching interest in implications for real-world physics.\n\nThis multifaceted project has the potential to resolve the long-standing incompatibility issue between the two pillars of modern physics and to position string theory as the leading candidate for a unified theory. By integrating new research directions and constructing a comprehensive framework, the findings from this project are expected to yield significant insights into the fundamental nature of the universe and to stimulate further groundbreaking developments in theoretical physics.\n\nKeywords: Gauge/Gravity Duality, AdS/CFT Correspondence, String Theory, Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, Mathematical Physics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Gauge/Gravity Duality and Geometry in String Theory\n\nThe fundamental discrepancy between quantum mechanics and general relativity has long posed a significant challenge to physicists' understanding of the universe's workings at all scales. String theory emerges as the principal candidate for unifying these two pillars of modern physics. Central to this endeavor is Maldacena's conjectured duality, known as the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. This groundbreaking proposal posits an equivalence between string theory in AdS spaces (d+1 dimensions) and CFT (d dimensions), providing a powerful theoretical framework for reconciling gravity with quantum mechanics.\n\nOur project aims to extend the gauge/gravity duality and enrich the mathematical toolbox required to explore this profound connection. By conducting a systematic study of AdS backgrounds within string theory and developing novel geometric structures—particularly generalised Sasaki-Einstein geometry—we seek to deepen our theoretical comprehension. Our objectives include probing supersymmetric gauge theories on curved manifolds, investigating dualities between different gauge theories, and studying gravity duals.\n\nFurthermore, we will scrutinize dualities that emerge in pairs of gauge theories and leverage localisation techniques to examine related matrix models. A particular interest lies in exploring how gauge/gravity duality can elucidate quantum critical phenomena, directly impacting our understanding of real-world physics.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach bridges physics and mathematics, promising to unlock new research directions by providing innovative mathematical approaches. The outcomes of this research are expected to have far-reaching implications, potentially revolutionizing our grasp of the universe at its most fundamental level and advancing the quest for a unified theory.\n\nKeywords: String theory, gauge/gravity duality, AdS/CFT correspondence, quantum mechanics, general relativity, Sasaki-Einstein geometry, quantum critical phenomena.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Gauge/Gravity Duality and Geometry in String Theory\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to delve into the enigmatic domain where quantum mechanics and general relativity converge, a frontier ambitiously addressed by string theory. At the crux of this endeavor is the groundbreaking AdS/CFT correspondence, a conceptual breakthrough pioneered by Maldacena, which postulates a profound equivalence between quantum gauge theories in 'd' dimensions and gravitational theories in 'd+1' dimensions. This intriguing duality suggests that strings moving in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time and operations within conformal field theory (CFT) are not just analogous but equivalent, presenting a compelling avenue for unifying the disparate forces described by quantum mechanics with the singular force of gravity described by general relativity.\n\nThe project's central aim is to extend the gauge/gravity duality and refine the mathematical fabric that underpins string theory. A systematic study of AdS backgrounds within string theory will be undertaken, alongside the development of novel geometric structures such as the generalized Sasaki-Einstein geometry. In parallel, the research will rigorously examine supersymmetric gauge theories on curved manifolds, investigate the relationships between pairs of gauge theories, and explore the implications of gauge/gravity duality for quantum critical phenomena.\n\nBy employing new mathematical approaches and expanding research across both physics and mathematics, the project promises to generate fresh insights into real-world physics and further our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level. The objectives are ambitious yet critical for deciphering the duality between quantum gauge theories and gravity, potentially leading to a more cohesive and comprehensive framework for the fundamental forces of nature.\n\nThis grant proposal endorses a multidisciplinary approach that boldly intersects theoretical physics and advanced mathematics, aiming to illuminate the intricate geometries of our universe and unify the currently incompatible theories that govern its micro and macro realms.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"The Gauge/Gravity Duality and Geometry in String Theory\" seeks to address one of the most profound problems in theoretical physics: the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Quantum mechanics successfully describes three subatomic forces, while general relativity accounts for gravity, yet these two theoretical frameworks remain incompatible. String theory emerges as the leading candidate for unification, and the key to this endeavor lies in understanding Maldacena's conjectured duality, known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which posits a remarkable equivalence between strings in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time and conformal field theory (CFT).\n\nOur project aims to extend the gauge/gravity duality and to develop novel mathematical approaches, thereby pushing new research directions in both physics and mathematics. The objectives include a systematic study of AdS backgrounds in string theory, the development of generalised Sasaki-Einstein geometry, investigation into supersymmetric gauge theories on curved manifolds, and the study of gravity duals and dualities between pairs of gauge theories. Additionally, the project will explore related matrix models from localisation techniques and gauge/gravity duality applications for quantum critical phenomena, which may reveal insights into real-world physics.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach that bridges theoretical physics and advanced mathematics, this project endeavors to deepen our understanding of the universe's fundamental forces and the fabric of space-time itself. The results have the potential to revolutionize our conceptual framework for all physical interactions and open up unexplored territories in both high-energy physics and geometry. This research is poised to provide pivotal contributions to the field of string theory and the quest for a unified theory of everything."

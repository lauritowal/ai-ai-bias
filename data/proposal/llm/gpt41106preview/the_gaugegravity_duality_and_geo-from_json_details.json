        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"The Gauge/Gravity Duality and Geometry in String Theory\" seeks to address one of the most profound problems in theoretical physics: the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Quantum mechanics successfully describes three subatomic forces, while general relativity accounts for gravity, yet these two theoretical frameworks remain incompatible. String theory emerges as the leading candidate for unification, and the key to this endeavor lies in understanding Maldacena's conjectured duality, known as the AdS/CFT correspondence, which posits a remarkable equivalence between strings in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time and conformal field theory (CFT).\n\nOur project aims to extend the gauge/gravity duality and to develop novel mathematical approaches, thereby pushing new research directions in both physics and mathematics. The objectives include a systematic study of AdS backgrounds in string theory, the development of generalised Sasaki-Einstein geometry, investigation into supersymmetric gauge theories on curved manifolds, and the study of gravity duals and dualities between pairs of gauge theories. Additionally, the project will explore related matrix models from localisation techniques and gauge/gravity duality applications for quantum critical phenomena, which may reveal insights into real-world physics.\n\nThrough a multidisciplinary approach that bridges theoretical physics and advanced mathematics, this project endeavors to deepen our understanding of the universe's fundamental forces and the fabric of space-time itself. The results have the potential to revolutionize our conceptual framework for all physical interactions and open up unexplored territories in both high-energy physics and geometry. This research is poised to provide pivotal contributions to the field of string theory and the quest for a unified theory of everything."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Engineering Vascularized Tissues\" aims to revolutionize the field of tissue engineering by addressing the critical challenge of vascularization in engineered 3D tissues. Vascular networks are vital for tissue survival and function, as they enable the exchange of nutrients and waste between the tissue and the host environment. This proposal seeks to delve into the intricacies of vessel network formation within engineered tissues and their subsequent integration with the host vasculature upon implantation.\n\nOur objectives are twofold: first, to uncover the mechanisms that govern in vitro vessel network assembly in multicellular constructs, and second, to elucidate the processes by which these prevascularized tissues integrate with the host's vessel networks to promote neovascularization in vivo. To achieve these goals, we will employ multicellular culturing techniques that bring together endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and tissue-specific cells to induce prevascularization in engineered muscle tissue.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research include enhanced media penetration within thick 3D constructs, significantly improved survival and vascularization of the engineered tissues upon implantation, and the formation of functional blood vessels that anastomose with host vasculature. These advancements hold profound implications for regenerative medicine, providing not only improved vascularization procedures for tissue constructs but also alternative models for studying vascularization processes in embryogenesis and disease states.\n\nThrough a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments utilizing animal disease models, we will explore the impact of construct prevascularization on implant survival and function. The knowledge gained from this research will lay the groundwork for future applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, potentially leading to enhanced treatment options for patients requiring tissue repair or replacement."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"An Anthropological Investigation of Muscular Politics in South Asia,\" addresses the critical issue of the entanglement between criminal activities and political arenas in South Asia, specifically in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This collaborative, cross-national ethnographic study seeks to delve into the increasing violence and criminal behaviors such as embezzlement, burglary, kidnapping, and murder within political contexts. The project aims to develop a robust political ethnography method that is both collaborative and policy-relevant, while also fostering an international network of scholars to enhance research capabilities.\n\nThe approach includes a local-level investigation combined with surveys and historical analysis within sixteen different political ethnographies sites across the three countries. The research team, composed of a principal investigator (PI) and four postdoctoral researchers, brings together expertise in ethnographic research, criminal politics, informal economies, and political violence. This expertise is underpinned by the PI's previous research on the cross-cultural study of democracy and muscular politics in the global South.\n\nOutcomes of the project are expected to be multifaceted, contributing comprehensive political ethnographies that offer empirical material and theoretical directives for further research. This will be beneficial to policy-making bodies, international organizations, and the academic community, providing insights and evidence to inform interventions and strategies to address the criminal-political nexus. Ultimately, the project aims to illuminate the complexities of muscular politics in South Asia and equip stakeholders with the knowledge to foster more transparent and accountable political environments.\n\nKeywords: Muscular politics, South Asia, Ethnography, Political violence, Criminalization of politics, Collaborative research, Policy development."

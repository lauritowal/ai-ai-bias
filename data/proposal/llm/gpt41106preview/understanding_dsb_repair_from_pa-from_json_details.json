        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Understanding DSB Repair from Pathway Choice to Long-Term Effects and Their Consequences\n\nThe integrity of DNA is paramount for cellular function and organismal health. This grant proposal outlines a comprehensive study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of double-strand break (DSB) repair, the restoration of the epigenetic landscape thereafter, and the long-term effects of DNA damage. The project will focus on the influence of the epigenetic landscape on the choice between the two major DSB repair pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). By utilizing modified DSB repair sensors, this research seeks to map the repair process in high throughput and with an unbiased timeline, extending the analysis to cover prolonged periods post-repair.\n\nThe objectives are to (1) investigate how the chromatin context affects pathway choice during DNA damage repair, (2) study the dynamic process of DNA repair and subsequent restoration of the epigenetic landscape, and (3) examine the potential long-lasting effects or 'epigenetic scars' that may contribute to ageing and age-related diseases. These goals will be achieved through innovative methods that include mapping sensor repair timelines and conducting investigations over extended periods post-repair.\n\nThe importance of this research lies in its applications to understanding ageing processes and the etiology of age-related diseases, particularly through the contexts of animal models of neurodegeneration and the efficiency of reprogramming to induce pluripotent stem cells (IPCs). The anticipated outcomes of this study will provide significant insights into DNA safekeeping, the maintenance of cellular function, and the prevention of deleterious long-term consequences of DNA damage."

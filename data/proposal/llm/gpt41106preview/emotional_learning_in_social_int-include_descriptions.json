        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project designed to explore the intricacies of emotional learning within the context of social interactions. The project seeks to bridge the gap between the biology of aversive learning and social cognition, providing a comprehensive examination of how individuals learn to navigate social environments through affective experiences. The research will specifically focus on four objectives: deciphering the mechanisms of learning about others' emotions, understanding how observation influences emotional learning, investigating the role of social characteristics in learning during interactions, and developing a computational neural model to elucidate the underlying processes of social-emotional learning.\n\nThe methodology to be employed encompasses a diverse array of approaches including novel behavioral paradigms, the utilization of manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience techniques, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. The expected outcome is the identification of four neural networks that facilitate social-emotional learning, with two networks shared with classical conditioning, and the remaining networks emphasizing social-cognitive processes and the formation of behavioral norms through interaction.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to deepen our understanding of societal phenomena such as group conflicts and adherence to norms, while also providing insights into psychological disorders characterized by impairments in social emotional learning, including social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy. By advancing knowledge in this domain, the project promises to contribute valuable information to the scientific community and offer a foundation for interventions to improve social functioning and cohesion."

By bringing together a novel set of experimental manipulations with two hitherto unconnected lines of research; biology of aversive learning and social cognition, it aims at answering four specific objectives, namely to identify the mechanisms of aversive learning (1) about others and its dependence on stimulus bound (e.g. ethnic group belonging) and conceptual (e.g. moral and social status) characteristics; (2) from others through observation, and its dependence on processing of stimulus bound (e.g. emotional expressiveness) and conceptual (e.g. empathy and mental state attributions) characteristics; (3) during interaction and its dependence social characteristics as described in 1 and 2; and (4) build and test a neural model of social-emotional learning. To achieve these objectives, I propose a multi-method research program using novel behavioral paradigms and manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. I predict that social emotional learning will be accomplished through the interaction of four, partially overlapping, neural networks coding for affective, associative, social cognitive and instrumental/goal directed aspects. Whereas the two first networks will be common to classical conditioning and social learning, I hypothesize that the latter will be distinguished by its reliance on the social-cognitive network. The fourth network is predicted to be integral to the social learning through interactions and the shaping of behavioral norms. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of important social phenomena, such as group conflicts and norm compliance. It will also shed light on common psychological disorders, such as social anxiety, autism and psychopathy that are characterized by dysfunctional of the social emotional learning system.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to initiate an unprecedented exploration of the conceptual underpinnings shaping political engagement among the citizens of India, the world’s largest democracy and a Rising Power. Despite the global significance of India's political landscape, our understanding of the indigenous political ideas influencing its populace remains superficial, often obscured by predominant Euro-American theoretical frameworks. The proposed project aims to address this gap by conducting a thorough ethnographic and historical investigation into the vernacular languages that embody India's demotic political ideas. \n\nA multidisciplinary team composed of anthropologists, historians, linguists, and political scholars will collaborate to achieve three core objectives. Firstly, the project will establish empirical and analytical foundations for a vernacular lexicography reflective of India's political dialect. Secondly, it will create an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages, serving as a dynamic resource for scholars and practitioners alike. Lastly, the initiative will engage with European political theorists to discuss the broader implications of these findings for global political theory. \n\nLeveraging the Principal Investigator's extensive research on demotic categories and values within Indian politics, the project promises to make significant contributions to the study of South Asian politics. Additionally, it will enhance the Begriffsgeschichte methodology by applying its principles outside European contexts, thereby fostering a more inclusive and representative global political theory. Ultimately, this project will shift the analytical focus from Western-centric paradigms to a richer understanding informed by the lived realities of diverse political cultures."

Much has been written about political ideas and institutions imported from Europe. And yet no focused, consecutive effort has gone into understanding the ideas that guide most ordinary Indian citizens’ engagement in their political lives. Analyses conducted through Euro-American categories and theoretical frames elevated to the status of universals – rights, identity, public sphere, secularism or indeed ‘politics’ – only generate paradoxes. This project will be a pioneering exploration of India’s demotic political ideas, which it will examine through a close ethnographic and historical scrutiny of the vernacular languages of its political life. Bringing together a team of anthropologists, historians, linguists and scholars of politics, and taking inspiration from the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, it will (1) lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life; (2) develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages; and (3) explore with scholars of European political ideas the implications of this work for global political theory. Drawing on the PI’s established work on the demotic categories and values in Indian politics, the project will break major new ground in the study of subcontinental politics; extend the methodological insights of the Begriffsgeschichte project beyond Europe; and make analytical advances towards a truly global political theory, grounded not in the analytical lingua franca of Western political theory, but in the realities of political life around the globe.",

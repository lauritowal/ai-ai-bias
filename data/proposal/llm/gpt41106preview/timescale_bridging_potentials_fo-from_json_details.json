        "Abstract:\n\nThe TIME-BRIDGE project seeks to revolutionize molecular dynamics simulations through the development of a novel pseudopotential ansatz. This groundbreaking initiative addresses the long-standing time-scale problem that has hindered simulations from reaching the microsecond to second range â€“ a gap spanning up to ten orders of magnitude. For over 80 years, this issue has persisted in the theoretical domain, with existing methods failing to bridge the vast discrepancy between the fast thermal motions of atoms and the prolonged mechanical processes of interest in materials design.\n\nLeveraging recent methodological and hardware advancements, which now make it feasible to tackle systems comprising trillions of atoms, TIME-BRIDGE will implement a nanostructured design approach grounded in first-principles simulations. The pseudopotential ansatz proposed is poised to capture the fast thermal motion of atoms within an effective potential, enabling the simulation of mechanical processes across the previously inaccessible time scales. With applications in materials design, particularly the creation of ultra-strength materials, the project holds the potential to transform our understanding and development of new materials.\n\nThe project carries both high risk and high gains, as the distinct physics of electrons and atomic motion poses a significant challenge. However, the Principal Investigator (PI) brings distinguished expertise to the table, assuring confidence in the project's success. The TIME-BRIDGE proposal is not merely an incremental step but a leap forward in computational material science, promising to deliver a transformative tool for researchers and developers in the field.\n\nThis ambitious project, while pushing the boundaries of current simulation capabilities, stands to offer a paradigm shift in our ability to predict and design material behavior at the most fundamental levels."

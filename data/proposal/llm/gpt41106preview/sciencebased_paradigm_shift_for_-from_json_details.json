        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Science-based Paradigm Shift for Metalworking Fluids - the Art of Cooling\" proposal presents an ambitious research initiative aimed at overhauling the application of metalworking fluids (MWFs), which are critical for the cooling of workpieces and tools, reducing heat generation through lubrication, removing chips, and promoting surface chemical reactions. Despite their importance, the current scientific understanding of MWF effectiveness is lagging, particularly as modern MWFs contain up to 60 harmful chemical components. \n\nThis project seeks to address these challenges by establishing a solid scientific foundation for MWF innovations. It proposes a cross-disciplinary and comprehensive four-mission research strategy. The first mission involves fundamental research on the physical, chemical, and microbial mechanisms that govern MWF performance. The second mission focuses on pioneering new MWF designs, particularly those incorporating lubricating bacteria, to replace harmful chemicals. The third mission targets the simplification of MWF maintenance and supply via the introduction of self-controlled chemical compositions and the adaptation of supply systems. Finally, the fourth mission aims at the verification and transfer of innovative systems through rigorous testing in both controlled bench setups and realistic environments at a demonstration center.\n\nBy integrating these missions, the project aims to stimulate a paradigm shift in MWF features and application, leading to safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly metalworking practices. The anticipated outcomes include a reduction in the hazardous chemical footprint of MWFs and the enhancement of manufacturing efficiency and sustainability. This grant proposal outlines a clear path for research and innovation in MWF technology, with the potential to transform industrial practices for the better."

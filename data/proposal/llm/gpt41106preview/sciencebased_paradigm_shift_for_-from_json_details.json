        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Science-based Paradigm Shift for Metalworking Fluids - the Art of Cooling\n\nThe proposed project aims to redefine the application of metalworking fluids (MWFs) by establishing a solid scientific foundation that will spearhead future innovations. Metalworking fluids are essential in the manufacturing industry for cooling workpieces and tools, reducing heat generation through lubrication, removing chips, and facilitating chemical reactions with surfaces. However, the scientific understanding of MWF effectiveness has not kept pace with the demands of rapidly evolving industrial applications. Moreover, typical MWFs contain up to 60 chemical components, many of which are harmful, presenting both environmental and health risks.\n\nOur project proposes a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary approach to address these challenges through four primary missions: (1) Conducting fundamental research on the physical, chemical, and microbial mechanisms that define the working processes of MWFs, (2) Designing innovative MWFs utilizing lubricating bacteria to replace harmful chemical components, (3) Simplifying MWF maintenance and supply by developing systems for in-process self-controlled chemical composition and adapting the supply infrastructure, and (4) Verifying and transferring these innovative systems through rigorous testing on a bench scale and in a realistic environment within a demonstration center.\n\nThe proposed work is poised to stimulate a paradigm shift in the features and applications of MWFs by focusing on science-based innovations. This shift will not only enhance the performance and sustainability of MWFs but also align their development with modern industrial practices, leading to safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly manufacturing processes.",
        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Science-based Paradigm Shift for Metalworking Fluids - the Art of Cooling\n\nThe proposed project aims to develop the scientific foundations necessary for advancing innovations in the application of metalworking fluids (MWFs), which are critical in manufacturing for cooling workpieces and tools, reducing heat generation through lubrication, removing chips, and promoting chemical reactions with surfaces. Despite their importance, current scientific understanding of MWFs is insufficient, lagging behind rapid industrial advancements. Moreover, the typical composition of MWFs involves up to 60 chemical components, many of which are harmful, presenting a significant health and environmental concern.\n\nTo address these challenges, the project outlines a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary research strategy encompassing four major missions. Mission A focuses on fundamental research into the physical, chemical, and microbial mechanisms of MWFs. Mission B aims to innovate new MWF designs, specifically emphasizing the development of formulations that use lubricating bacteria. Mission C is dedicated to simplifying MWF maintenance and supply through the introduction of self-controlled chemical compositions and adaptations of supply systems. Finally, Mission D involves the verification and transfer of these innovative systems, including testing on a bench, in a realistic environment, and at a demonstration center.\n\nBy fostering scientific-based innovations, this project anticipates stimulating a significant paradigm shift in the features and application of MWFs. The project's distinguishing feature is its cross-disciplinary and comprehensive approach, which is expected to yield safer, more efficient, and environmentally friendly MWFs. The outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize the metalworking industry, improving operational efficiency and sustainability, while reducing the health risks associated with the current generation of MWFs.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"Science-based Paradigm Shift for Metalworking Fluids - the Art of Cooling\" seeks to revolutionize the application of metalworking fluids (MWFs) by establishing an innovative scientific foundation for their development and use. Metalworking fluids are essential for cooling workpieces and tools, reducing heat generation through lubrication, removing chips, and promoting surface chemical reactions. However, the current scientific understanding of MWF effectiveness is outdated compared to the rapid advancements in industrial applications. Moreover, conventional MWFs comprise up to 60 harmful chemical components, raising environmental and health concerns.\n\nThis project aims to address these issues through four interconnected research missions. Mission A focuses on fundamental research into the physical, chemical, and microbial mechanisms of MWFs to gain a comprehensive understanding of their working principles. Mission B involves the development of new MWF designs, particularly the innovative use of lubricating bacteria-based MWFs that promise to be environmentally benign. Mission C seeks to simplify MWF maintenance and supply by establishing in-process self-controlled chemical composition and adapting supply systems for efficiency. Finally, Mission D will ensure the verification and transfer of these innovative systems through rigorous testing on a bench, in a realistic environment, and at a demonstration center.\n\nThe distinguishing features of this proposal are its cross-disciplinary approach and comprehensive nature, which collectively aim to stimulate a paradigm shift in the features and application of MWFs.

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Towards Total Scene Understanding using Structured Models\" seeks to revolutionize the field of computer vision and linguistics by developing advanced algorithms capable of generating natural language sentences that accurately describe visual scenes. This interdisciplinary endeavor addresses a critical challenge in computational linguistics: the synthesis of object recognition, action understanding, and 3D scene recovery to produce comprehensive scene descriptions.\n\nDespite the depth of current research in constituent areas such as edge and feature detection, tracking, camera calibration, projective geometry, segmentation, denoising, stereo methods, and object detection, the breadth of integration across these domains remains limited. Our project proposes an innovative approach that treats the scene as an integrated whole, employing a unified common cost function or energy model to facilitate this integration. This model will guide the development of efficient algorithms for learning and inference, crucial for the translation of complex visual inputs into coherent linguistic outputs.\n\nPreliminary experiments indicate the potential for a paradigm shift and a quantum leap in performance compared to existing methods. The proposed system will be demonstrated through applications with immediate societal benefits, such as prosthetic vision aids for the visually impairedâ€”a group that encompasses over 300 million people worldwide.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this research extends beyond aid for the visually impaired, with transformative effects expected in linguistics, human-computer interaction (HCI), robotics, and the broader field of computer vision. By bridging gaps between these disciplines, the project aims to establish a new standard for total scene understanding and set the stage for future advancements in technology that can interact with and interpret the world in a manner akin to human cognition. This project not only promises to enhance our theoretical understanding of visual and linguistic processing but also holds the potential for worldwide applications that will significantly improve the quality of life for many."

        "Abstract:\n\nOur proposal, \"Heterogeneous integration of imprecise memory devices to enable learning from a very small volume of noisy data,\" aims to bridge the gap between the current capabilities of electronic devices and the robustness exhibited by biological systems, such as the cricket's nervous system, in processing sensory data. The primary goal of the DIVERSE project is to develop innovative technology that facilitates effective real-time decision-making using a limited volume of noisy data, a challenge that is especially pertinent in low-power devices where energy inefficiency arises due to the separation of logic and memory components.\n\nTo achieve this, we draw inspiration from neuroscience and propose the integration of novel brain-inspired computing architectures with new resistive memory technologies that mimic the characteristics of ideal memory: very high density, high reliability, non-volatility, and infinite endurance. Our approach is cross-disciplinary, combining insights from biology, neuroscience, and electrical engineering to create a technology that does not yet exist. We anticipate that this new technology will not only yield extremely high power efficiency but also robust cognitive computing capabilities.\n\nThe proposed solution, informed by our experience with resistive memories, aims to overcome the limitations of current memory devices by providing a hardware/software platform capable of learning from imperfect data sources. The outcome will be an innovative fabrication result that addresses the current challenge of energy inefficiency and is applicable to several domains, including service and consumer robotics, implantable medical diagnostic microchips, and wearable electronics.\n\nThis project represents a transformative step in the field of cognitive computing, with the potential to enable a wide range of devices to operate more like the efficient and adaptive systems found in nature."

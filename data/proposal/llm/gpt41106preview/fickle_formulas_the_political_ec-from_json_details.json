        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Fickle Formulas: The Political Economy of Macroeconomic Measurement,\" aims to critically examine the construction and application of macroeconomic indicators which are pivotal to economic governance and policy-making. Recognizing that measurements of growth, unemployment, inflation, and public deficits are not mere statistical representations but are laden with political, social, and economic implications, this research seeks to unravel the complex factors that shape these crucial indicators.\n\nThe project's central objective is to understand the diverse influences that determine the formulas used to calculate macroeconomic indicators, revealing the distributional consequences of these measurements and the often-hidden environmental costs obfuscated by indicators like GDP. Through a comparative analysis of the evolution of these indicators in the UK, US, France, and Germany, supplemented by a study of the politics of measurement in emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, the project will offer a comprehensive international and historical perspective.\n\nThe methodology includes an in-depth analysis of statistical harmonization efforts by international organizations such as the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank, as well as the construction of a database designed to test hypotheses regarding the development and application of measurement formulas.\n\nExpected to engage public debate and prompt reflection among policy-makers, this research also aspires to sensitize academics to the political underpinnings of macroeconomic data. With a focus on both developed and developing nations, and covering a range of indicators, the project will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the political economy undergirding macroeconomic measurement.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes are multifaceted: fostering informed public discourse, enhancing policy deliberation, and enriching academic scholarship with empirical and theoretical tools to dissect international and temporal differences in macroeconomic measurement practices. The research will provide insights into the implications of these indicators for policy and governance, making a significant contribution to the fields of economics, political science, and international relations.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Fickle Formulas: The Political Economy of Macroeconomic Measurement,\" endeavors to dissect the intricate web of social, political, and economic influences that contour the methodologies used to compute critical macroeconomic indicators such as growth, unemployment, inflation, and public deficits. These indicators serve as linchpins in the architecture of economic governance, shaping policies through growth targets and the adjustment of wages according to inflation.\n\nDespite their importance, there is a conspicuous absence of comprehensive tools to elucidate the variations in measurement formulas both within and across nations and throughout history. The project aims to fill this gap by pursuing several core objectives, including understanding the construction and application of these indicators, examining their distributional impacts, and probing the multifaceted factors that influence their formulation.\n\nEmploying a robust research approach, the project will conduct a systematic comparison of the evolution of these indicators in eight strategically selected countries: the UK, the USA, France, Germany, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa. The project will also scrutinize efforts at statistical harmonization by pivotal international organizations such as the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank. Furthermore, a detailed database will be constructed to facilitate quantitative hypothesis testing.\n\nThe project is expected to yield significant outcomes, including stimulating public debate on the significance and relevance of these measures, encouraging policy-makers to reconsider current practices, and increasing awareness among academics of the political underpinnings of macroeconomic data. By encompassing a set of five sub-projects, this initiative promises to catalyze a paradigm shift in the understanding of macroeconomic measurement, thereby benefiting a wide array of target audiences including the public, policy-makers, and the academic community.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Fickle Formulas: The Political Economy of Macroeconomic Measurement\" aims to dissect the intricate web of social, political, and economic factors that shape the construction of crucial macroeconomic indicators such as growth, unemployment, inflation, and public deficits. Despite the central role these measures play in informing policies—from setting growth targets to indexing wages to inflation—the processes and implications of their formulation remain underexplored.\n\nThrough a comparative analysis across eight countries (UK, US, France, Germany, China, India, Brazil, and South Africa), the project seeks to understand the evolution of these indicators and the international efforts toward statistical harmonization by organizations such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. A specific objective is to uncover the distributional consequences and the potential obscuration of environmental costs by current Gross Domestic Product (GDP) calculations.\n\nThe research will fill a gap in existing literature that often lacks the tools to describe and explain differences in measurement formulas both internationally and historically. A robust database will be constructed for quantitative hypothesis testing, and a systematic comparison of the politics behind macroeconomic measurement in both developed and emerging economies will be conducted. The project will comprise five sub-projects, each addressing a facet of the overarching research questions, such as \"Why are economies measured in the current ways?\"\n\nAnticipated outcomes of the research include fostering public debate over what constitutes meaningful economic measures, prompting policy-makers to reflect on current practices, and increasing awareness among academics of the political roots underlying macroeconomic data. The project targets a diverse audience, including the public, policy-makers, and academics, ensuring broad engagement with its findings and potential impact on economic governance and measurement practices.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Fickle Formulas: The Political Economy of Macroeconomic Measurement\n\nThe project \"Fickle Formulas: The Political Economy of Macroeconomic Measurement\" is poised to dissect the underlying social, political, and economic factors that influence the construction and evolution of macroeconomic indicators such as growth, unemployment, inflation, and public deficits. Recognizing that these indicators are not mere statistical representations, but tools that actively shape economic governance and policy direction, the research endeavors to unveil the intricacies of their formulation and the implications that arise from their use.\n\nObjectives of the project include a thorough understanding of how macroeconomic indicators are defined and measured, an examination of their distributional consequences, and an investigation into the forces that shape their measurement formulas. By studying the evolution of these indicators in the UK, USA, France, and Germany, the project will conduct a comparative analysis that reveals the variation and commonalities in their development. Complementing this, efforts of statistical harmonization spearheaded by international organizations like the UN, IMF, and World Bank will be scrutinized.\n\nA novel database will be constructed to rigorously test hypotheses and support empirical research. Additionally, the project will delve into the politics of macroeconomic measurement in emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, providing a comprehensive global perspective.\n\nThe anticipated impacts are multifaceted: fostering public debate over what constitutes meaningful measures, prompting policy-makers to critically reflect on current practices, and sensitizing academics to the political determinants of macroeconomic data. This project aims to fill the gap in theoretical and empirical tools needed to understand international and historical variations in measurement formulas, thereby influencing a wide array of target audiences including the public, policy-makers, and the academic community.\n\nThrough its five sub-projects encompassing eight countries and engaging major economic organizations, \"Fickle Formulas\" aspires to reshape our comprehension of macroeconomic data's political economy and advocate for more transparent and equitable economic measures."

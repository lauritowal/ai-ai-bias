        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Fickle Formulas: The Political Economy of Macroeconomic Measurement\n\nThe project \"Fickle Formulas: The Political Economy of Macroeconomic Measurement\" is poised to dissect the underlying social, political, and economic factors that influence the construction and evolution of macroeconomic indicators such as growth, unemployment, inflation, and public deficits. Recognizing that these indicators are not mere statistical representations, but tools that actively shape economic governance and policy direction, the research endeavors to unveil the intricacies of their formulation and the implications that arise from their use.\n\nObjectives of the project include a thorough understanding of how macroeconomic indicators are defined and measured, an examination of their distributional consequences, and an investigation into the forces that shape their measurement formulas. By studying the evolution of these indicators in the UK, USA, France, and Germany, the project will conduct a comparative analysis that reveals the variation and commonalities in their development. Complementing this, efforts of statistical harmonization spearheaded by international organizations like the UN, IMF, and World Bank will be scrutinized.\n\nA novel database will be constructed to rigorously test hypotheses and support empirical research. Additionally, the project will delve into the politics of macroeconomic measurement in emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, providing a comprehensive global perspective.\n\nThe anticipated impacts are multifaceted: fostering public debate over what constitutes meaningful measures, prompting policy-makers to critically reflect on current practices, and sensitizing academics to the political determinants of macroeconomic data. This project aims to fill the gap in theoretical and empirical tools needed to understand international and historical variations in measurement formulas, thereby influencing a wide array of target audiences including the public, policy-makers, and the academic community.\n\nThrough its five sub-projects encompassing eight countries and engaging major economic organizations, \"Fickle Formulas\" aspires to reshape our comprehension of macroeconomic data's political economy and advocate for more transparent and equitable economic measures."

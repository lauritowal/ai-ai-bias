        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Forest Intelligence\" grant proposal introduces \"I-Wood,\" a cutting-edge project inspired by nature's own 'Wood Wide Web'â€”the complex mycorrhizal networks that underscore forest ecosystems. This ambitious initiative seeks to emulate the intricate plant-fungus interactions to preserve these networks, critical in mitigating the accelerating carbon cycle and the broader impacts of climate change.\n\nCentral to I-Wood is the development of innovative robotic networks that draw on the principles of mycorrhizal symbiosis. The project aspires to achieve two main goals: to analyze natural processes within plant communities and to leverage these insights to develop sustainable technologies. At the heart of the proposed solutions are a plant-inspired perceptron-like model for data processing and a fleet of plant-inspired robots endowed with root-like exploration abilities. These robots will exhibit dynamic behaviors such as growing, ageing, branching, and elongating, reflecting the adaptability and resilience of plant life.\n\nI-Wood will conduct its experimental phase in a mixed social network within a confined space, facilitating direct interaction between robots and real plants. This multi-disciplinary venture, at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and biology, envisions creating new paradigms in robotics, embodied AI, and providing invaluable insights into the conservation of biodiversity and climate protection strategies.\n\nThe intended outcomes of the project are groundbreaking: from mimicking plant collective behaviors and co-developing morphology and behavior to influencing the future of robotics by moving beyond traditional, animal-based or brain-based models. I-Wood represents a transformative approach to understanding and preserving plant communities, with profound implications for biodiversity and climate change mitigation."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Forest Intelligence: Robotic Networks Inspired by the Wood Wide Web\n\nThe \"Forest Intelligence\" project, titled \"I-Wood,\" seeks to innovate the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence by drawing inspiration from the \"Wood Wide Web\"—the complex mycorrhizal networks that underlie forest ecosystems. Recognizing the pivotal role that these networks play in carbon cycling and climate change mitigation, the project aims to preserve mycorrhizal networks through the development of sustainable technologies.\n\nAt the core of the I-Wood initiative are two ambitious goals: to analyze natural processes involved in plant-fungus interactions and to develop a plant-inspired perceptron-like model. These objectives will be pursued through the creation of robotic systems that not only grow, age, branch, and elongate but also exhibit network-augmented perception and collective behaviors that mirror those of plant communities.\n\nTo achieve these ends, the project will employ a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating expertise from robotics, AI, and biology. Robots designed with root-like exploration abilities will be tested within a dynamic mixed social network in a confined space alongside real plants, to not only mimic plant morphology and behaviors but also to co-develop morphology and behavior in response to environmental cues.\n\nThe expected outcomes of I-Wood are transformative, signaling new paradigms in robotics that move beyond animal-based or brain-based models. The project promises advancements in embodied AI and the application of robotics within biological research, leading to a deeper scientific understanding of plant communities. By embodying the principles of the mycorrhizal network, I-Wood stands to make a significant contribution to biodiversity conservation and climate protection, offering innovative strategies for tackling some of the most pressing environmental issues of our time.",
        "Abstract\n\nThe \"Forest Intelligence\" project, christened I-Wood, is an ambitious cross-disciplinary endeavor inspired by the intricate mycorrhizal networks known as the Wood Wide Web. This initiative aims to preserve these crucial mycorrhizal networks, which play a vital role in mitigating the accelerated carbon cycle and the adverse effects of climate change. The project seeks to analyze natural processes and develop sustainable technologies by emulating the collective behaviors of plant life.\n\nAt the heart of I-Wood lies the development of a plant-inspired perceptron-like model and the creation of innovative plant-inspired robots. These robots are uniquely designed with capabilities such as growing, ageing, branching, and elongating, akin to the root exploration of real plants. The project's proposed solutions encompass the design of robots that can network-augment perception and exhibit plant-like collective behaviors, thereby mimicking the morphology and behavior of plants in dynamic environments.\n\nI-Wood's testing environment will be a mixed social network in a confined space, where these plant-inspired robots will interact with real plants, providing a unique opportunity to study plant-fungus interaction mechanisms. This multi-disciplinary project integrates Robotics, Embodied AI, and Biology to push the boundaries of our scientific understanding of plant communities and to contribute significantly to biodiversity and climate protection.\n\nThe expected outcomes of I-Wood include the establishment of new paradigms in robotics, the embodiment of artificial intelligence beyond traditional animal-based or brain-based models, and the pioneering use of robotics in biological research. Ultimately, the project aspires to enhance scientific knowledge on plant communities, thereby informing strategies for biodiversity conservation and climate protection. The I-Wood project promises to harness the principles of the mycorrhizal network to innovate in the fields of robotics and AI, potentially transforming our approach to environmental stewardship and the fight against global warming.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe Forest Intelligence project, dubbed \"I-Wood,\" is an innovative initiative inspired by the complex and efficient natural communication system known as the Wood Wide Web. This project is at the confluence of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Biology and aims to preserve the crucial mycorrhizal networks that are pivotal for mitigating the impacts of global warming. The heart of I-Wood is to analyze and replicate the natural processes of plant-fungus interactions, developing a new paradigm in robotics that draws from the resilience and adaptability of these biological networks.\n\nThe project's primary goals include developing a plant-inspired perceptron-like model and creating robotic entities with root-like exploration capabilities. These robots will possess unique features such as the ability to grow, age, branch, and elongate, thus mimicking the dynamic nature of plant life. Their behavior will be augmented by network perception, allowing for plant-inspired collective behaviors within a dynamic environment.\n\nI-Wood's testing will take place in a mixed social network within a scale-down confined space that includes real plants, facilitating direct interaction and learning from living ecosystems. This multi-disciplinary endeavor is poised to break new ground in embodied AI and robotics, while simultaneously providing valuable insights into plant communities, contributing to biodiversity conservation, and offering potential solutions to climate protection.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project are manifold, including the establishment of new paradigms in robotics that move beyond traditional animal-based or brain-based models, advancements in the integration of robotics in biological research, and an enrichment of scientific knowledge concerning plant communities. This could ultimately foster novel strategies for biodiversity maintenance and climate change mitigation, showcasing the transformative potential of leveraging the principles of the mycorrhizal network in technological innovation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Forest Intelligence\" grant proposal introduces \"I-Wood,\" a cutting-edge project inspired by nature's own 'Wood Wide Web'—the complex mycorrhizal networks that underscore forest ecosystems. This ambitious initiative seeks to emulate the intricate plant-fungus interactions to preserve these networks, critical in mitigating the accelerating carbon cycle and the broader impacts of climate change.\n\nCentral to I-Wood is the development of innovative robotic networks that draw on the principles of mycorrhizal symbiosis.

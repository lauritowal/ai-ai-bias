        "Abstract:\n\nThe project PROSECMET, \"Function and Production of Secondary Metabolites,\" addresses the significant role of bacterial secondary metabolites (SMs) in modern therapy for various diseases. Despite their importance, gaps remain in our understanding of the natural function of SMs, the regulatory networks controlling their production, and strategies to increase both the number and yield of these metabolites. Utilizing the model entomopathogenic bacteria, Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, which live in symbiosis with nematodes, this proposal aims to elucidate these aspects through a comprehensive set of work packages (WPs).\n\nWP1 focuses on the identification of SM targets within bacteria, nematodes, insects, and other food competitors. This will be achieved through the synthesis of SM derivatives and the application of chemical biology techniques. WP2 aims to unravel the regulatory networks by identifying external factors that activate SM production and determining whether SMs themselves act as internal signals. Flow cytometry, along with promoter-reporter gene fusion, will be key methodologies employed.\n\nWP3 seeks to increase chemical diversity by applying the factors identified in WP2 to enhance the SM variety and yield in at least 100 different bacterial isolates. This will involve genome sequencing and promoter exchanges to facilitate SM biosynthesis. Finally, WP4 aims at the optimization of SM production by coupling cell growth with SM production, thereby systematically constructing SM overproducers using regulatory elements or designed regulators from WP2.\n\nThe expected outcomes of PROSECMET include a deeper understanding of the natural roles of SMs, elucidation of the regulatory networks involved in their production, and the development of novel methods to significantly increase the number and yield of these metabolites, thus contributing to their potential therapeutic applications. The project leverages a combination of derivatives synthesis, chemical biology methods, flow cytometry, and genomic techniques to achieve its goals."

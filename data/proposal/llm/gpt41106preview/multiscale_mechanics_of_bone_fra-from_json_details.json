        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal entitled \"Multiscale Mechanics of Bone Fragility in Type-2 Diabetes\" aims to address a critical gap in the understanding and clinical assessment of bone fragility associated with Type-2 Diabetes (T2D). Patients with T2D face a tripled risk of bone fractures, despite no reduction in bone volume. This paradox suggests an impairment of bone quality, rather than quantity, likely due to the non-enzymatic cross-linking of organic proteins in the bone matrix, known as Advanced Glycation End-products (AGE) accumulation.\n\nCurrent diagnostic techniques focus primarily on bone quantity and fail to predict fracture probability in T2D patients accurately. Our research will develop a multiscale computational framework that couples behaviors from the molecular level to the whole-bone level and uses a probabilistic multi-level model to evaluate the relationship between hip fracture probability, bone quantity, and bone quality.\n\nThe project will employ both computational and experimental frameworks to establish relationships between AGE crosslink-density and whole-bone fragility in animal and human T2D diabetic bone tissue. The innovative aspect of our research is the proposed clinical fracture risk assessment strategy that includes a surrogate measure of bone quality obtained from a clinically obtainable blood sample, representing a systemic measure of AGE content.\n\nOur proposed multiscale approach is poised to advance the understanding of bone fragility in T2D and to innovate solutions for clinical assessment of diabetic bone disease. The potential impact of this research is substantial, offering novel insights into the mechanisms of diabetic bone fragility and providing a more accurate and accessible method for evaluating fracture risk in T2D patients. This project has the potential to transform current clinical practices and improve the quality of life for millions of individuals living with Type-2 Diabetes.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Multiscale Mechanics of Bone Fragility in Type-2 Diabetes\n\nIndividuals with Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) are at a heightened risk of bone fractures, with a threefold increase compared to non-diabetic populations. Despite this, current diagnostic techniques inadequately predict fracture probability, as they primarily measure bone quantity rather than quality. The proposed project, \"Multiscale Mechanics of Bone Fragility in Type-2 Diabetes,\" aims to address this gap by developing a multiscale computational and experimental framework that integrates molecular-level changes with whole-bone mechanics to better understand and predict bone fragility in T2D.\n\nThe core hypothesis driving this research is that the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) within the bone matrix is a critical factor contributing to the increased fragility. To explore this, the project will employ a novel probabilistic multi-level model focused on hip fracture probability, informed by relationships established between AGE crosslink-density and whole-bone fragility in both animal models and human T2D bone tissue.\n\nOur innovative strategy proposes the use of a systemic measure of AGE content, which can be obtained from a clinically accessible blood sample, as a surrogate marker for bone quality. This approach contrasts with existing protocols that only consider bone quantity, thereby potentially revolutionizing clinical fracture risk assessment for T2D patients.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this project includes a significant advancement in the understanding of bone fragility mechanisms specific to T2D, as well as the development of novel solutions for the clinical assessment of diabetic bone disease. By coupling detailed computational modeling with practical experimental validation, the project promises to deliver a more reliable and accessible diagnostic tool that can inform personalized treatment strategies and preventative care for patients with T2D, ultimately reducing the burden of fractures in this vulnerable population.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Multiscale Mechanics of Bone Fragility in Type-2 Diabetes\" addresses a critical gap in the clinical assessment of bone fragility among Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) patients. Despite not experiencing a reduction in bone volume, individuals with T2D are at a threefold increased risk of bone fractures. Current diagnostic techniques focus primarily on bone quantity and fail to predict fracture probability in T2D, suggesting that bone quality impairment, particularly due to non-enzymatic cross-linking of organic proteins (AGE accumulation), plays a significant role in increased fragility.\n\nOur research aims to develop a multiscale computational framework, coupled with experimental studies, to elucidate the mechanisms of diabetic bone fragility. The framework will couple behavior from molecular to whole-bone levels and establish relationships between AGE crosslink-density and whole-bone fragility. This approach will inform a probabilistic multi-level model of hip fracture, designed to evaluate the relationship between hip fracture probability, bone quantity, and bone quality.\n\nInnovation lies in our novel strategy for clinical fracture risk assessment that will incorporate measures of bone quantity and a surrogate measure of bone quality—systemic measure of AGE content—obtainable from a clinically accessible blood sample. This surrogate measure will potentially revolutionize the current protocol, which only measures bone quantity.\n\nThe anticipated impact of the project includes an advanced understanding of bone fragility in T2D, and the potential innovation of novel solutions for the clinical assessment of T2 diabetic bone disease. By integrating multiscale mechanics with clinical practice, this project can significantly improve the predictive capability of fracture risks in T2D patients and inform therapeutic strategies to mitigate fracture incidences, enhancing patient care and quality of life.\n\nKeywords: Type-2 Diabetes, bone fragility, AGE accumulation, multiscale computational framework, clinical assessment, fracture risk prediction.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Multiscale Mechanics of Bone Fragility in Type-2 Diabetes\n\nType-2 Diabetes (T2D) is associated with a 3-fold increase in bone fracture risk, despite unaltered bone volume, implicating impaired bone quality. Current diagnostic techniques focus on bone quantity and fall short in predicting fracture risk in T2D patients. This limitation is suspected to arise from non-enzymatic cross-linking of organic proteins within the bone matrix, known as advanced glycation end-products (AGE) accumulation. Our proposal, \"Multiscale Mechanics of Bone Fragility in Type-2 Diabetes,\" aims to address this critical gap by developing a multiscale computational and experimental framework that investigates the intrinsic properties affected by AGE accumulation.\n\nThe proposed research will couple molecular-level behavior with whole-bone mechanics to establish relationships between AGE crosslink-density and whole-bone fragility. Utilizing a novel probabilistic multi-level model, we will assess the hip fracture probability in T2D, integrating measures of both bone quantity and quality. This model will be informed by data derived from both animal models and human T2D bone tissue.\n\nThe novelty of our strategy lies in the clinical fracture risk assessment, which moves beyond existing protocols that measure bone quantity alone. We propose a surrogate measure of bone quality through a clinically obtainable systemic measure of AGE content via blood samples. This approach will provide a more accurate assessment of fracture risk in T2D patients.\n\nThe project promises to advance our understanding of bone fragility mechanisms in T2D and introduce novel solutions for clinical assessment. Successful completion of this project will have significant implications for the development of innovative strategies in the management and treatment of T2 diabetic bone disease, potentially reducing the risk of fractures and improving quality of life for affected individuals.\n\n(Word Count: 287)"

        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Novel Symbioses\"\n\nThe \"Novel Symbioses\" project presents an innovative interdisciplinary approach aimed at redefining cellular architecture through the establishment of artificial endosymbioses, mirroring the evolutionary origin of organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. The primary goal is to introduce and optimize new metabolic traits within eukaryotic hosts by integrating prokaryotic endosymbionts, thus extending cellular functionalities and potentially revolutionizing biotechnological applications.\n\nThe project is organized into two fundamental phases. Phase 1 will focus on designing synthetic cell-in-cell merger couples, optimizing metabolic prerequisites for cooperation, and developing nanotechnology for precise cell incorporation. This phase will establish the foundation for metabolically interdependent co-cultures capable of supporting the envisaged endosymbioses.\n\nPhase 2 involves the delivery of cells into host cells to initiate functional endosymbioses and the subsequent optimization of these symbiotic relationships through re-engineering and experimental evolution. The exploration will concentrate on core metabolic processes, specifically biological nitrogen and carbon fixation, which are crucial for bioengineering and environmental applications.\n\nThe project's unique strategy leverages the opportunities presented by experimental evolution and nanotechnology, aiming to overcome the challenges of introducing new functionalities into cells. The expected outcomes include the establishment of novel compartmentalized functions within organisms and the development of a comprehensive understanding of the principles guiding endosymbioses and organellogenesis.\n\n\"Novel Symbioses\" has the potential to not only expand our know-how in cellular biology and nanotechnology but also to pave the way for breakthroughs in sustainable bioproduction and synthetic biology, providing a platform for future innovations in these fields."

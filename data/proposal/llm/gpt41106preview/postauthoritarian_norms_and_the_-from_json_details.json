        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\" (POSTNORM) project seeks to develop a comprehensive theory that addresses the lasting impact of former authoritarian regimes on the ideological landscape of new democracies. Drawing on the observed decline of left-wing parties in Poland, the late rise of radical right parties in Portugal, and the prevalence of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe, this research aims to elucidate how the rejection of past regimes' ideologies shapes the current political spectrum. Employing novel survey experiments, POSTNORM will test the hypothesis that post-authoritarian democracies avoid associations with the political orientation of their previous regimes, resulting in biases that affect both voter behavior and political elite strategies.\n\nThis project will contribute to the understanding of political competition in new democracies by examining the underlying factors that influence party formation, national identity, programmatic stances, and party elites' discourse. By identifying and analyzing the impact of ideological legacies on democratic processes, POSTNORM will provide a parsimonious theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition across nations emerging from authoritarian rule.\n\nKey investigators conducting this research include Grzymala-Busse and Kostelka and Rovny, whose previous work has laid the groundwork for understanding ideological shifts in post-authoritarian contexts. The anticipated impacts of the project include a deeper comprehension of voter and elite behavior, the dynamics of party competition, and the facilitation of a more nuanced approach to political discourse and policy-making in newly established democracies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\" (POSTNORM) aims to advance our understanding of how the ideological brands of former authoritarian regimes continue to shape political landscapes in new democracies. Despite the fall of such regimes, their legacies persist, manifesting in voter behaviors and party dynamics that influence current political positions. POSTNORM seeks to answer pressing research questions, such as the near extinction of left-wing parties in Poland by 2015, the late emergence of radical right parties in Portugal, and the prevalence of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe project hypothesizes that in countries with left-wing authoritarian pasts, individuals and parties shy away from the left, while in those with right-wing dictatorships, the avoidance is towards the right. Through novel survey experiments, POSTNORM will explore how these biases from past regimes affect demand- and supply-side party competition, citizen preferences, perceptions of parties, national identity, political discussions, new party supply, party names, programmatic stances, and elite discourse.\n\nExpected outcomes include a parsimonious theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition across new democracies and nuanced insights into how past authoritarian regime ideology influences contemporary democratic dynamics. POSTNORM will provide a significant contribution to the field by offering a robust explanation for the observed variance in ideological leanings and party success across post-authoritarian states, with anticipated impacts on the understanding of voter and political elite behavior. References to foundational work by Grzymala-Busse (2019) and Kostelka and Rovny (2019) will underpin the theoretical framework and empirical analysis, ensuring the project's grounding in current academic discourse.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\" (POSTNORM) seeks to advance our understanding of the enduring impact of authoritarian regimes on contemporary political landscapes in new democracies. The overarching hypothesis posits that the ideological leanings of past dictatorships—whether left- or right-wing—play a crucial role in shaping the political positions and allegiances of voters and elites in the post-authoritarian era. We aim to answer pressing research questions, such as the near extinction of left-wing parties in Poland by 2015, the late entry of a radical right party into the Portuguese parliament, and the higher propensity for right-wing protests in Eastern Europe.\n\nEmploying novel survey experiments, POSTNORM aims to test and develop a theory that connects the avoidance of ideological associations with former regimes to a broad range of political phenomena, including party competition, electoral behavior, national identity, and political discourse. The anticipated outcomes include a parsimonious theory explaining the heterogeneity in political competition across new democracies and insights into how the rejection of an old regime's ideology influences current democratic processes.\n\nThis project is expected to have a significant impact on the fields of political science and democratization studies by providing a comprehensive analysis of how authoritarian legacies affect contemporary political dynamics. Moreover, it will offer valuable explanations for the behavior of voters and political elites in post-authoritarian settings, contributing to the broader discourse on democratic consolidation and stability.\n\nReferences: Grzymala-Busse (2019) and Kostelka and Rovny (2019) provide foundational insights that inform the study's hypotheses and research design.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\" (POSTNORM) project aims to develop a theory that addresses the profound influence of historical authoritarian regimes on contemporary political dynamics in new democracies. This project seeks to understand why left-wing parties in Poland have faced a stark decline, the late emergence of a radical right party in Portugal, and the higher incidence of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. POSTNORM posits that the ideological rejection of past authoritarian regimes is a key factor driving these phenomena.\n\nThrough novel survey experiments, POSTNORM will test hypotheses that, in nations following left-wing dictatorships, there is an aversion to left-wing associations among voters and political elites, and conversely, an avoidance of right-wing associations in countries with a history of right-wing dictatorships. The project will focus on Poland, Portugal, and various Eastern European countries, offering insights into how past ideological affiliations shape current political norms, competition, and national identities.\n\nExpected outcomes include the formulation of a parsimonious theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition in new democracies and an analysis of how ideological biases from previous regimes impact citizen preferences, party perceptions, and discourse among political elites. This research will significantly contribute to our understanding of voter and elite behavior, adding depth to the discourse on party competition and the lasting effects of authoritarian ideologies. Key investigators such as Grzymala-Busse and Kostelka & Rovny provide foundational references for the project's approach."

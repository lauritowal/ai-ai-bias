        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Post-Authoritarian Norms and the Ideological Legacy of Dictatorships\" (POSTNORM) project aims to develop a theory that addresses the profound influence of historical authoritarian regimes on contemporary political dynamics in new democracies. This project seeks to understand why left-wing parties in Poland have faced a stark decline, the late emergence of a radical right party in Portugal, and the higher incidence of right-wing protests in Eastern Europe. POSTNORM posits that the ideological rejection of past authoritarian regimes is a key factor driving these phenomena.\n\nThrough novel survey experiments, POSTNORM will test hypotheses that, in nations following left-wing dictatorships, there is an aversion to left-wing associations among voters and political elites, and conversely, an avoidance of right-wing associations in countries with a history of right-wing dictatorships. The project will focus on Poland, Portugal, and various Eastern European countries, offering insights into how past ideological affiliations shape current political norms, competition, and national identities.\n\nExpected outcomes include the formulation of a parsimonious theory explaining the heterogeneity of political competition in new democracies and an analysis of how ideological biases from previous regimes impact citizen preferences, party perceptions, and discourse among political elites. This research will significantly contribute to our understanding of voter and elite behavior, adding depth to the discourse on party competition and the lasting effects of authoritarian ideologies. Key investigators such as Grzymala-Busse and Kostelka & Rovny provide foundational references for the project's approach."

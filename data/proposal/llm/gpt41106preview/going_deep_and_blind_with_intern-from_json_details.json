        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Going Deep and Blind with Internal Statistics\" presents an innovative approach to visual inference by integrating unsupervised internal data recurrence with the cutting-edge methodologies of deep learning. The core objective of this project is to enable machines to make unsupervised inferences without the need for prior examples or extensive training datasets, thereby solving complex ill-posed inverse problems that are pervasive in image and video analysis. This is accomplished by exploiting the internal redundancy inherent in visual media and combining it with deep learning algorithms to create a hybrid model that benefits from both internal and external sources of statistical information.\n\nA significant limitation of current deep learning paradigms is their reliance on large volumes of training data, which may not always be available or may entail substantial costs in acquisition and annotation. Furthermore, these methods often neglect the wealth of image-specific information available within the data itself. Our proposal aims to circumvent these obstacles by enabling a continuum between internal and external training, allowing for effective model training with minimal data requirements. This approach promises to unlock totally unsupervised deep learning capabilities when no training data are available and to enhance supervised deep learning outcomes even with modest amounts of training data.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a range of both low-level and high-level inferences applicable to images and videos, the establishment of a continuum between internal and external training, and the exploration of the tradeoffs between the quantity of training data and the balance of internal-vs-external training. The project will open up new applications across various disciplines and domains, with a particular emphasis on making substantial progress in video analysis. By addressing the challenges associated with internal data reliance and the data-hungry nature of current deep learning methods, our proposed solutions will pave the way for a unified approach that leverages the full spectrum of available data, setting a new standard for unsupervised and supervised learning in the field of visual inference.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Going Deep and Blind with Internal Statistics\n\nThe proposed project, \"Going Deep and Blind with Internal Statistics,\" introduces a transformative approach to visual inference that combines unsupervised learning with deep learning techniques. This innovative strategy leverages internal data recurrence, exploiting the redundant nature of images and videos to facilitate blind inferences without the need for vast amounts of prior examples or extensive training datasets. \n\nThis research aims to overcome the limitations of current deep learning methods, which are heavily reliant on large-scale external training data and often neglect the wealth of information available within the data itself. Our approach is centered on the novel concept of unsupervised internal data recurrence to solve complex ill-posed inverse problems, creating a scalable continuum between internal and external training methods. This enables the model to operate with varying amounts of training data, ranging from fully unsupervised scenarios with no available external data to situations where external data is scarce.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project are manifold. We expect to achieve robust low-level and high-level inferences for image and video analysis, establish a balance between reliance on internal and external data for training, and catalyze the development of totally unsupervised deep learning algorithms. Moreover, the project will enhance supervised deep learning techniques that require only modest amounts of training data, thereby opening up new applications across various disciplines and domains. We also foresee substantial progress in video analysis, which has profound implications for numerous fields, including security, entertainment, and healthcare.\n\nBy addressing the challenges of internal data recurrence and the current dependency on large external datasets in deep learning, our proposed solutions will pave the way for more adaptable and efficient visual inference models. This project holds the promise of significant advancements in the field of computer vision and the broader landscape of artificial intelligence research.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Going Deep and Blind with Internal Statistics,\" seeks to revolutionize the field of computer vision by developing a novel approach that synergizes unsupervised visual inference with deep learning. Traditional deep learning methods require substantial amounts of training data and often overlook the rich internal statistics present within individual images and videos. This project aims to overcome these limitations by harnessing unsupervised Internal Data Recurrence (IDR) and exploiting the redundancy within the data itself, thus enabling the system to perform blind inferences without reliance on extensive prior examples or external training.\n\nOur objectives are to: (1) facilitate unsupervised inferences for complex, ill-posed inverse problems, (2) create a continuum that synergistically leverages internal data recurrence and external data for both unsupervised and supervised learning, and (3) drastically reduce the dependency on large datasets for training deep learning models. The expected outcomes include the capability to perform both low-level and high-level inferences on images and videos, establish a balance between internal and external training sources, and enable deep learning in environments where training data are scarce or in cases where only modest amounts of data are available.\n\nBy combining the strengths of unsupervised IDR with advanced deep learning algorithms, we propose to unlock new applications across various disciplines and domains, particularly advancing video analysis. Our project will also investigate the tradeoffs between the quantity of training data and the reliance on internal versus external training, aiming to develop a unified and efficient approach suitable for a wide array of practical applications.\n\nThis groundbreaking research promises to set a new paradigm in the field, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and providing substantial benefits to both the scientific community and numerous real-world applications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Going Deep and Blind with Internal Statistics\" introduces an innovative framework that bridges the gap between unsupervised internal data recurrence and deep learning (DL) to revolutionize visual inference tasks. Unlike traditional DL methods that rely heavily on extensive external training datasets, our approach capitalizes on the inherent redundancy within images and videos to perform inferences. Our proposed methodology aims to circumvent the limitations of existing DL by enabling both unsupervised and supervised learning paradigms to operate effectively with varying amounts of data.\n\nOur primary objective is to enable unsupervised inference without the need for prior examples or training, addressing complex ill-posed inverse problems that have remained challenging for current techniques. By combining the rich, untapped potential of internal data recurrence with the robust learning capabilities of DL, we set the foundation for a continuum between internal and external training. This hybrid model not only facilitates totally unsupervised learning in data-scarce scenarios but also enhances supervised learning with modest training datasets.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are multifaceted. We anticipate achieving a broad spectrum of low-level and high-level inferences for image and video processing. Additionally, our research will explore the tradeoffs between internal and external training, breaking new ground in the understanding of DL dynamics. This project promises to unlock new applications across various disciplines and domains, leading to substantial advancements in video analysis.\n\nBy addressing the challenges of reliance on internal data and the insatiable data appetite of current DL methods, our proposal offers solutions that leverage the best of both worlds. Our approach is poised to redefine the landscape of visual inference, paving the way for a new era of efficient and powerful image and video analytics."

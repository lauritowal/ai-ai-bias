        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Going Deep and Blind with Internal Statistics\" introduces an innovative framework that bridges the gap between unsupervised internal data recurrence and deep learning (DL) to revolutionize visual inference tasks. Unlike traditional DL methods that rely heavily on extensive external training datasets, our approach capitalizes on the inherent redundancy within images and videos to perform inferences. Our proposed methodology aims to circumvent the limitations of existing DL by enabling both unsupervised and supervised learning paradigms to operate effectively with varying amounts of data.\n\nOur primary objective is to enable unsupervised inference without the need for prior examples or training, addressing complex ill-posed inverse problems that have remained challenging for current techniques. By combining the rich, untapped potential of internal data recurrence with the robust learning capabilities of DL, we set the foundation for a continuum between internal and external training. This hybrid model not only facilitates totally unsupervised learning in data-scarce scenarios but also enhances supervised learning with modest training datasets.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are multifaceted. We anticipate achieving a broad spectrum of low-level and high-level inferences for image and video processing. Additionally, our research will explore the tradeoffs between internal and external training, breaking new ground in the understanding of DL dynamics. This project promises to unlock new applications across various disciplines and domains, leading to substantial advancements in video analysis.\n\nBy addressing the challenges of reliance on internal data and the insatiable data appetite of current DL methods, our proposal offers solutions that leverage the best of both worlds. Our approach is poised to redefine the landscape of visual inference, paving the way for a new era of efficient and powerful image and video analytics."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: ADPribosylation and Ubiquitination; Post-Translational Interplay\n\nThe proposed project aims to elucidate the complex crosstalk between ADPribosylation and ubiquitination, key post-translational modifications that regulate vital cellular processes. This interplay is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and its dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including infectious diseases and cancers. Our research will focus on the dynamic modification of ubiquitin (Ub) with ADP-ribose (ADPr) and the molecular intricacies of the enzymes responsible for the addition and removal of these modifications.\n\nThis multifaceted study will explore the biochemical scope of protein-protein interactions involving UbADPr-isotypes and assess the cell biological consequences of these interactions. We anticipate that our findings will provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which ADPribosylation and ubiquitination affect immune response, cell cycle progression, proteasome-mediated protein degradation, DNA damage responses, and apoptosis. Furthermore, we expect to uncover the role of these modifications in the context of intracellular bacterial replication, DNA damage repair, and tumor development.\n\nTo achieve our objectives, we will develop novel chemical methodologies, create new substrates, activity-based probes, and assay reagents tailored for the unique specificity and preferences of ADPribosylation and ubiquitination enzymes. These tools will allow us to study the interactions and pathways in cells with unprecedented detail. Additionally, we will screen for small molecule inhibitors that can selectively target these enzymes, paving the way for therapeutic intervention strategies.\n\nThe research team brings together experts in protein synthesis, chemical biology, and structural biology, ensuring a comprehensive approach to tackling the proposed research goals. Through this integrated study, we aim to advance the frontiers of cell biology and contribute to the development of innovative treatments for diseases associated with aberrant ADPribosylation and ubiquitination."

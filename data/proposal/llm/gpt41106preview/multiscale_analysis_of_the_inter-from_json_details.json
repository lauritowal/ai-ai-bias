        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Multi-scale analysis of the interplay between cell morphology and cell-cell signaling\n\nUnderstanding the complex interactions between cell morphology, cell-cell signaling, and genetic regulatory circuits is vital for unraveling the mechanisms of tissue development and embryonic patterning. This project aims to dissect the multi-scale interplay among these factors, with a specific focus on Notch signaling and its role in the development of mammalian inner ear morphology. Through a combination of quantitative in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, complemented by mathematical modeling, we intend to provide a systems-level understanding of how cell shapes and boundary properties influence intercellular communication and, consequently, the robustness of tissue patterning.\n\nOur objectives include elucidating how cell morphology affects Notch signaling, analyzing the dependence of cell-cell signaling on cell boundary geometry and molecular composition, and integrating these insights with genetic regulatory circuits to explain the emergence of ordered differentiation patterns. We will employ novel reporter technologies, advanced micropatterning techniques, and high-resolution cochlear inner ear explant imaging, coupled with a novel hybrid modeling approach, to achieve our goals.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a comprehensive map of how cell boundary geometry and molecular composition affect Notch signaling, an understanding of the interplay between cell morphology and Notch signaling in the context of cochlear patterning, and the ability to track the transition from an undifferentiated state to the ordered arrangement of hair and supporting cells. This investigation will contribute to a systems-level understanding of development, connecting morphology with regulatory circuits, providing insights that could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for developmental disorders and tissue engineering applications."

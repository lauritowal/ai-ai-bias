        "Abstract:\n\nThe STAIN-IT project proposes a transformative approach to histopathological diagnosis by developing a non-invasive computational immunohistochemical staining method leveraging deep learning and multimodal imaging. Traditional haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, while standard, is labor-intensive and requires experienced pathologists for interpretation. Alternative immunohistochemical staining methods enhance diagnostic specificity but present challenges, including technical complexity, prolonged duration, and increased cost.\n\nTo address these issues, STAIN-IT will employ cutting-edge imaging techniques such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and two-photon-excited fluorescence, coupled with advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project aims to mimic immunohistochemical stainings and develop accurate staining models, thus providing a label-free, non-invasive, and cost-effective diagnostic tool. A core objective is to quantitatively understand and approximate the nonlinear behavior of CNNs, enhancing transparency and reducing the 'black box' nature of these models. This will enable the quantification of tissue changes associated with staining models, facilitating their clinical implementation.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include a labor-inexpensive solution for fast computational immunohistochemical staining, increased diagnostic reliability, and a better understanding of disease pathogenesis. Potential applications are diverse, notably the rapid test of the antigen KI-67 during intraoperative frozen section consultation and the use of Collagen IV as a quality control marker for tissue-engineered medicines.\n\nThe STAIN-IT project stands to revolutionize histopathological diagnostics, offering significant benefits for clinical routine, including expediting intraoperative decision-making and enhancing the development and quality control of tissue-engineered therapeutic products."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"STAIN-IT\" project proposes an innovative approach to immunohistochemical staining, addressing key limitations of current diagnostic methods in pathology. Traditional haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical staining are cornerstones of tissue-based diagnosis; however, these methods are fraught with issues such as technical complexity, lengthy processing times, and high costs. In response, STAIN-IT leverages multimodal imaging techniques—specifically coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), second harmonic generation (SHG), and two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF)—combined with advanced deep learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our project aims to develop non-invasive, label-free, and fast computational immunohistochemical staining models that can reliably mimic traditional staining methods.\n\nThe objectives of STAIN-IT are fourfold: 1) to accurately mimic immunohistochemical stainings, 2) to establish robust predictive models for staining, 3) to quantitatively understand and approximate the behavior of CNNs, and 4) to quantify tissue changes associated with disease pathogenesis. By achieving these goals, we expect to overcome the \"black box\" nature of CNNs, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of the deep learning process.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of STAIN-IT include the development of a label-free and non-invasive diagnostic tool that significantly reduces labor and cost. This computational approach will facilitate a faster diagnostic process and can be easily implemented into clinical routines. The proposed system promises to increase diagnostic reliability and contribute to a better understanding of disease pathogenesis.\n\nPotential applications of the STAIN-IT project include a rapid test of the antigen KI-67 in intraoperative frozen section consultations and the use of Collagen IV as a quality control marker for tissue-engineered medicines. These applications highlight the transformative potential of STAIN-IT in both clinical and research settings, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes through enhanced diagnostic practices.",
        "Abstract:\n\nProject STAIN-IT aims to revolutionize histopathology by developing a non-invasive, computational immunohistochemical staining technique that leverages the power of deep learning and multimodal imaging. Traditional haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, while effective, is limited by its invasiveness, technical complexity, high cost, and time consumption. These constraints often lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our proposal outlines a novel approach that uses coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and two-photon-excited fluorescence imaging methods combined with deep learning algorithms, specifically convolution neural networks (CNNs), to mimic the results of immunohistochemical staining without the associated drawbacks.\n\nThe primary objectives of STAIN-IT are to create robust staining models that replicate traditional immunohistochemical stainings, enhance the understanding and quantitative analysis of the nonlinear behavior of CNNs, and develop methods to approximate CNN behavior for increased transparency. Our anticipated outcomes include a label-free, non-invasive, labour-inexpensive, and fast computational immunohistochemical staining process. These outcomes will directly contribute to increased diagnostic reliability and a better understanding of disease pathogenesis. We envision the immediate application of our technique in the intraoperative rapid KI-67 antigen test, crucial for cancer diagnostics, and the use of Collagen IV as a quality control marker for tissue-engineered medicines.\n\nThe STAIN-IT project is poised to deliver a transformative tool in histopathology, overcoming current limitations and setting a new standard for rapid and reliable diagnostics. Its successful implementation in clinical settings will provide a significant leap forward in patient care and biomedical research.\n\n(Word Count: 247)",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Non-invasive Computational Immunohistochemical Staining Based on Deep Learning and Multimodal Imaging\n\nThe proposed project, STAIN-IT, seeks to revolutionize pathological diagnostics by developing an innovative, non-invasive computational immunohistochemical staining technique. Currently, haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining is the diagnostic standard, requiring manual labor by experienced pathologists. The widely-used alternative, immunohistochemical staining, is hindered by its technical complexity, time-consuming nature, and cost. STAIN-IT aims to overcome these challenges by employing a label-free measurement technique enhanced with multimodal imaging methods, including coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and two-photon-excited fluorescence.\n\nTo achieve high accuracy and reliability, STAIN-IT will utilize advanced deep learning techniques, specifically convolution neural networks (CNNs). The project's objectives include mimicking traditional immunohistochemical stainings, developing robust staining models, quantitatively understanding and approximating the nonlinear behavior of CNNs, and quantifying tissue changes. This approach seeks to reduce the 'black box' nature of CNNs, offering transparency in the diagnostic process.\n\nAnticipated outcomes of STAIN-IT include the creation of a label-free, non-invasive, labor-inexpensive, and fast computational immunohistochemical staining process. This will facilitate easy clinical implementation, increase diagnostic reliability, and enhance the understanding of disease pathogenesis. Key applications of this technology are envisioned in the rapid test of the antigen KI-67 during intraoperative frozen section consultations and the use of Collagen IV as a quality control marker for tissue-engineered medicines.\n\nThe impact of STAIN-IT could be transformative, offering a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for pathologists and potentially improving patient outcomes by expediting treatment decisions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe STAIN-IT project proposes a transformative approach to histopathological diagnosis by developing a non-invasive computational immunohistochemical staining method leveraging deep learning and multimodal imaging. Traditional haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, while standard, is labor-intensive and requires experienced pathologists for interpretation. Alternative immunohistochemical staining methods enhance diagnostic specificity but present challenges, including technical complexity, prolonged duration, and increased cost.\n\nTo address these issues, STAIN-IT will employ cutting-edge imaging techniques such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation, and two-photon-excited fluorescence, coupled with advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

A core objective is to quantitatively understand and approximate the nonlinear behavior of CNNs, enhancing transparency and reducing the 'black box' nature of these models. This will enable the quantification of tissue changes associated with staining models, facilitating their clinical implementation.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include a labor-inexpensive solution for fast computational immunohistochemical staining, increased diagnostic reliability, and a better understanding of disease pathogenesis.

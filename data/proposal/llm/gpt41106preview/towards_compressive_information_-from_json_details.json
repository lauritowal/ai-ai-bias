        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Towards Compressive Information Processing Systems,\" seeks to revolutionize the field of compressive sampling (CS) by addressing critical challenges faced by complex information processing systems. These systems are currently strained by the need to handle vast amounts of information with limited communication and computational resources. Our research aims to substantially reduce these requirements by integrating CS into the core of information processing frameworks, thereby creating a paradigm shift in how information signals are acquired, represented, and manipulated.\n\nThis innovative approach to CS will be applied across various application contexts, including multiview video, medical imaging, and hyperspectral imaging. By developing a robust theoretical foundation and advanced algorithms, the project endeavors to perform signal manipulations such as compression, encryption, communication, reconstruction, analysis, extraction, and decision-making directly on linear measurements. This methodology circumvents the complexity of traditional signal reconstruction, leading to a more efficient and cost-effective system performance.\n\nThe project has a two-fold impact: firstly, it will provide fundamental tools for next-generation information processing systems, and secondly, it will catalyze the success of European industries specializing in communications and signal processing by fostering the integration of new technology. The anticipated outcome is an order-of-magnitude improvement in system performance, achieved at a lower cost. By nurturing innovations such as acquiring information signals through a small set of linear projections, the project not only contributes to the scientific community but also ensures a competitive edge for Europe in the global market.\n\nThe \"Towards Compressive Information Processing Systems\" project embodies the cutting edge of signal processing research, leveraging the power of CS to meet the ever-growing demand for efficient information processing in a connected world."

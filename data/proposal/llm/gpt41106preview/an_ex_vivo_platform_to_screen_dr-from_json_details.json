        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"An ex vivo platform to screen drug effects on bone,\" an innovative High Content Screening (HCS) platform designed to revolutionize the drug discovery process for bone diseases, particularly osteoporosis, which is primarily caused by abnormal bone remodeling. The proposed platform aims to address the low success rates in clinical trials, overcome the limitations of current 2D cell-based screenings, and tackle the complexity of 3D visualization in screening cultures.\n\nThe core of the proposal is the development of a cutting-edge 3D culture technology integrated with micro-computed tomography based monitoring to maintain tissue-specific cell viability and interactions within an ex vivo 3D osteochondral system. This approach is poised to provide a more accurate representation of bone cell reactions during bone remodeling, ultimately leading to better precision in drug discovery.\n\nObjectives of the project include a significant reduction in the reliance on animal experiments, thereby aligning with the ethical principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement), and demonstrating the commercial value of the platform to the pharmaceutical industry. The platform will be validated by comparing drug effects with known effects on bone, ensuring reliability and effectiveness.\n\nAnticipated benefits are multifold: a reduction in the time and cost associated with drug development, an increase in success rates of clinical trials, and a cost-effective experimental design that complies with animal welfare considerations. Moreover, the proposal aims to build a solid knowledge transfer strategy to share findings with the scientific community and explore further applications of the technology.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed ex vivo platform holds the potential to make significant contributions to both the fundamental understanding of bone diseases and the commercial aspects of drug discovery, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes and advancing healthcare in the field of bone disease treatment."

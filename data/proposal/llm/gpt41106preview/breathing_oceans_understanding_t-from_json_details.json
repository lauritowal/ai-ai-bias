    "descriptions": [
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Breathing Oceans\" aims to elucidate the complex role of the ocean's organic skin layer in modulating the exchange of key greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) between the atmosphere and the ocean. Accounting for 20-40% of the post-industrial CO2 sink, oceans serve as a critical global reservoir for greenhouse gases. However, quantifying gas exchange across the air-water interface remains a challenge due to the presence of surface-active substances, known as surfactants, originating from multiple biotic and abiotic sources. This proposal focuses on a land-ocean transect from South America toward the African Continent, employing new in-situ sensor platforms and advanced geochemical characterization techniques to investigate the spatial and temporal effects of surfactant suppression on gas exchange. By integrating the generated data into hydrological and gas flux models, the project aims to provide a unique and comprehensive understanding of oceanic sinks and sources of greenhouse gases, both now and for future projections. The outcomes will significantly contribute to climate change models, offering critical insights into the intricate dynamics of our planet's \"Breathing Oceans.\""

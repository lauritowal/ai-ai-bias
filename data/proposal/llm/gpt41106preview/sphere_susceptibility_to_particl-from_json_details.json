        "Abstract:\n\nThe SPHERE project, standing for Susceptibility to Particle Health Effects, miRNAs and Exosomes, is a groundbreaking study designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which air pollution contributes to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), with a particular focus on the role of exosomes as mediators of this effect. Given the high consistency of epidemiological findings linking air pollution to CVD and the moderate or weak evidence for intermediate mechanisms, this study aims to fill a critical knowledge gap.\n\nOur hypothesis proposes that exposure to particulate matter (PM) and PM-associated metals influences the composition and function of exosomes in human plasma, thereby affecting CVD risk factors and outcomes. To test this, we will recruit a cohort of 2000 overweight or obese individuals from the Center for Obesity and Weight Control, Milan, acknowledging obesity as a susceptibility factor.\n\nWe will employ a range of exposure assessment methods, including the measurement of ambient pollutant concentrations, geographical information system modeling, road density, and traffic intensity data, as well as personal passive samplers in a subgroup of 200 subjects. The study design consists of a two-stage, split-sample approach; the discovery stage will involve OpenArray miRNA expression profiling in 1000 subjects, followed by a replication stage using real-time analysis of the top 10 miRNAs identified.\n\nFurthermore, we will develop an in vitro model using A549 lung cells, granulocytes, and endothelial cells to examine whether exosomes produced by lung/granulocytes can directly interact with and potentially cause dysfunction in endothelial cells.\n\nSPHERE's integrated research strategy promises to advance our understanding of the biological pathways through which air pollution influences CVD, emphasizing the role of miRNAs and exosomes. This could lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, ultimately contributing to the prevention and treatment of CVD in populations exposed to air pollution."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Singularities and symplectic mapping class groups,\" aims to delve into the uncharted waters of symplectic topology, particularly focusing on the symplectic mapping class group (SMCG), which is the group of isotopy classes of symplectomorphisms. SMCGs play a pivotal role in connecting various mathematical disciplines such as modern geometry, classical mechanics, low-dimensional topology, representation theory, algebraic varieties moduli spaces, and quantum mechanics.\n\nDespite its significance, the understanding of SMCGs in dimensions higher than two, where they correlate with the classical mapping class group, remains sparse. The project's primary objective is to bridge this gap by exploring the automorphisms of a symplectic manifold, with a focus on smoothings of isolated singularities. The project is structured into four key studies: the examination of Milnor fibres of simple elliptic and cusp singularities, the analysis of Stein varieties associated with two-variable singularities and quivers, the description of categorical SMCGs of \"universal Milnor fibres,\" and the investigation into the dynamics of SMCGs.\n\nOur research approach combines multiple methodologies, including mirror symmetry, representation theory, singularity theory, geometric group theory, algebraic geometry, and homological stability. By integrating these diverse theoretical frameworks, the project will not only advance our understanding of SMCGs but also provide new insights into the aforementioned mathematical disciplines.\n\nThe proposed research has the potential to answer classical questions in singularity theory and open new avenues for mathematical exploration. With its ambitious scope and innovative strategies, this project seeks to make a significant contribution to the field of symplectic topology and beyond."

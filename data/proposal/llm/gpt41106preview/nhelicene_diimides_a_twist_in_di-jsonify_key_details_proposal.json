Therefore, chiral organic semiconductors (OSCs), which utilize both charge and spin of the carriers, are needed as new materials to drive the development of next-generation (opto)electronics such as spin-LEDs, 3D displays, and quantum-based optical computing. While the field of OSCs has matured, there is an urgent need for chiral OSCs, which can offer high charge-carrier mobilities along with the strong chiroptical response to transform the laboratory-based proof-of-concept research on chiral OSCs into real-world applications. The objective of the proposed research is to develop chiral OSC materials, which will exhibit (i) effective chiroptical responses, (ii) high fluorescence quantum yields, and (iii) dynamic spin-selective charge-transport. To achieve this goal, I plan to develop a new class of functional chiral molecules, namely, [n]helicene diimides ([n]HDI), where two six-membered imide moieties are spanned by an [n]helicene spacer. The proposed research bridges two well-established research fields: (i) planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bearing diimide units, which are excellent semiconductors, and (ii) 3D [n]helicenes, which display strong chiroptical responses. The research plan will capitalize on three synthetic strategies: (1) A small-molecule approach to gain a fundamental understanding of the structure-function relationship, originating from the through-bond and through-space coupling between imide moieties. (2) A multi-helicene approach to expand the application scope by taking control over the electronic energy levels and self-assembly behavior. (3) Macromolecular approach to develop homochiral multifunctional materials employing enantiopure [n]HDIs as molecular synthons."

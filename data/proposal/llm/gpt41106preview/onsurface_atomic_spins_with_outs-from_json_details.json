        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"On-Surface Atomic Spins with Outstanding Quantum Coherence\"\n\nThis proposal, entitled \"On-Surface Atomic Spins with Outstanding Quantum Coherence,\" outlines an ambitious research project aimed at revolutionizing quantum information processing and magnetic sensing through the development of a new atomic-force microscopy (AFM)-based architecture. The primary objective is to significantly enhance the coherent properties of atomic spins on surfaces, thus enabling quantum research and applications at the atomically precise limit.\n\nLeveraging a combination of advanced techniques including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), electron spin resonance (ESR), AFM, and magnetic exchange force microscopy, this project seeks to address one of the most challenging frontiers in quantum technology: the manipulation and detection of single spins in a milliKelvin-AFM setup. By utilizing 25Mg nuclear spins within a magnesium oxide substrate, the project aims to harness these nuclear spins as a robust quantum resource, overcoming the conventional challenges associated with the phase coherence time and low-temperature requirements of quantum systems.\n\nThe proposed research will tackle key obstacles such as the detection of spins on surfaces and the integration of these quantum systems into practical devices. The outcomes are poised to have a profound impact on quantum research, offering insights into potential qubit systems and setting the stage for atomic-scale quantum information processing and sensing technologies.\n\nThe team, with its extensive experience in the field of ESR-STM, is uniquely positioned to execute this cutting-edge research, which promises to not only advance our understanding of quantum phenomena but also lay the groundwork for the next generation of quantum technologies. The project, ATOMQUANT, represents a significant leap forward in the quest for quantum coherence and control at the most fundamental level."

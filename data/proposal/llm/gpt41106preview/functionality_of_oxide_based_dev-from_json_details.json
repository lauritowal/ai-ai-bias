        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Functionality of Oxide based devices under Electric-field: Towards Atomic-resolution Operando Nanoscopy (FOXON)\n\nThe FOXON project seeks to revolutionize the understanding of oxide electronics through state-of-the-art experimental techniques that bridge the gap between current theoretical models and experimental reality. The central objective is to elucidate the interplay between the electrical behavior and atomic structure of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structured devices under electric fields, with a focus on oxygen dynamics and interface switching phenomena. The expected outcome is to inform the design of advanced nanoelectronics and foster the development of new quantum and information technologies.\n\nTo achieve these aims, the project proposes the development of novel microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) chips for operando transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. These chips will facilitate in situ electrical biasing of electron-transparent lamella devices, thus enabling simultaneous current-voltage measurements and structural, chemical, or electronic structure analysis during device operation. The lab-on-a-chip approach will allow controlled studies of metal-oxide functional devices, furthering understanding of the atomic-level mechanisms that govern their properties.\n\nThis project builds on prior work, including the successful electrical contact and operation of a lamella device fabricated from a MIM structure, and the design of a MEMS-based chip for in situ electrical biasing, as documented in \"Ultramicroscopy\" and \"Advanced Functional Materials,\" respectively. These studies have laid the groundwork for a deeper investigation into the dynamics of oxygen vacancies and the stability of quantized conductance states in resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices.\n\nThrough FOXON, we anticipate significant advancements in the operando TEM field, ultimately paving the way for novel device architectures and functionalities in oxide electronics. The project stands to make a substantial impact on the scientific community's understanding of oxide-based devices, with broad implications for the future of technology."

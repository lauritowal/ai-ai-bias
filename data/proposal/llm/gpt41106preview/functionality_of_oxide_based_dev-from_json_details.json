        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Functionality of Oxide based devices under Electric-field: Towards Atomic-resolution Operando Nanoscopy (FOXON)\n\nThe FOXON project aims to revolutionize our understanding of oxide electronics by advancing our ability to observe and correlate the dynamic electrical behavior of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structured devices with their atomic structures in real-time. Our objective is to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimental realities by employing cutting-edge operando nanoscopy techniques.\n\nWe propose to develop a novel microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based chip that facilitates in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis while simultaneously performing electrical biasing of electron-transparent lamella devices. This lab-on-a-chip approach enables us to observe the atomic-level mechanisms of oxide electronics under direct electric fields, focusing on the switching phenomena of oxide thin films and interfaces.\n\nOur scientific mission involves comprehensive studies on the dynamics of oxygen vacancies and the stability of quantized conductance states in resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices. We anticipate that the FOXON platform will allow us to perform concurrent current-voltage measurements with structural, chemical, and electronic analyses, shedding light on the atomic-level processes that govern device behavior.\n\nThe proposed project is built upon previous work (Ultramicroscopy 181 (2017) 144-149; Adv. Funct. Mater. (2017) 1700432) and seeks to develop beyond state-of-the-art techniques for operando TEM of MIM devices. Through this project, we expect to pave the way for new advancements in nanoelectronics and quantum information technologies by providing a deeper understanding of oxygen dynamics in emergent oxide electronics.\n\nThe potential impact of FOXON is significant, offering the possibility of translating nanoscale insights into macroscopic device performance improvements, thereby contributing to the advancement of next-generation electronic materials and devices.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Functionality of Oxide based devices under Electric-field: Towards Atomic-resolution Operando Nanoscopy\" (FOXON) project represents a pioneering investigation into the atomic-scale mechanisms that govern the performance of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structured devices in oxide electronics. FOXON's central objective is to bridge the existing gap between theoretical models and experimental observations by correlating electrical behavior with atomic structure during device operation. This entails operando investigations of oxide thin films and interface switching phenomena under electrical bias, thus providing insights into the dynamics of oxygen vacancies and the stability of quantized conductance states in resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices.\n\nEmploying cutting-edge techniques such as the use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) chips for in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and advanced lab-on-a-chip approaches, FOXON will enable current-voltage measurements concomitant with structural, chemical, or electronic structure analysis. Building upon prior foundational studies published in \"Ultramicroscopy\" and \"Advanced Functional Materials,\" the project will develop a novel MEMS-based chip designed for in situ electrical biasing, facilitating the electrical contact and operation of an electron-transparent lamella device.\n\nThe FOXON initiative aspires to significantly advance the field of nanoelectronics by realizing beyond state-of-the-art operando TEM capabilities for MIM structured devices. This breakthrough will foster a comprehensive understanding of atomic-level mechanisms in oxide electronics, which is essential for the development of new quantum and information technologies. The project's success will not only answer open questions in the realm of oxide electronics but also pave the way for the creation of superior device performance driven by a deep understanding of oxygen dynamics.",

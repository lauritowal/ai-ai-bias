        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Fragmentation in Turbulence Revisited - Toward a universal theory for turbulent emulsification\" aims to pioneer the field of turbulent emulsification by developing a universal theory that transcends the limitations of the traditional Kolmogorov-Hinze approach. This initiative, also known as the FragTuRe project, proposes to revisit and expand upon the concept of the Hinze scale, a critical parameter in the understanding of emulsification processes in turbulent flows.\n\nThe objectives are to not only develop a novel deterministic approach for studying these phenomena but also to refine the description of the Hinze scale through the lens of enstrophy transportâ€”a concept not previously exploited in this context. By integrating theoretical investigation with cutting-edge experimental characterization and advanced numerical simulation, the FragTuRe project endeavors to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive theory of emulsification in turbulent drop-laden and bubbly flows.\n\nInnovation lies at the heart of this proposal, with techniques such as tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), shape reconstruction, and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) being utilized to observe and quantify the spectral rate of enstrophy transport. These methodologies will provide a large dataset that is crucial for the development of a universal theory.\n\nThe expected outcomes include a novel description and a case-independent universal correlation for the Hinze scale, which are anticipated to have profound implications across various applications, including atomization, emulsification, and both environmental and industrial processes.\n\nThe FragTuRe project represents a significant leap forward in the theoretical and practical understanding of turbulent emulsification. Its success will not only provide a new paradigm in the study of turbulence but also equip engineers and scientists with a powerful tool for optimizing processes in numerous engineering applications."

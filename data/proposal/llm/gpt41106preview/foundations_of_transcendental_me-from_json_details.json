        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Foundations of transcendental methods in computational nonlinear algebra,\" seeks to address fundamental theoretical issues in algebraic geometry and the computational challenge of nonlinearity by developing a robust theoretical framework and computational tools. The proposed project aims to establish foundational methods in computational nonlinear algebra, enhancing reliability and applicability through the development of a theory of transcendental continuation for the numerical computation of multiple integrals. This interdisciplinary effort will combine the fields of algebraic geometry, symbolic algorithms, and numerical ordinary differential equation solvers to create algorithms capable of computing algebraic invariants of complex varieties with unprecedented rigidity and precision, exceeding thousands of digits.\n\nThe project will focus on the design of algorithms that enable the computation of integrals with rigorous error bounds and the development of software implementations to turn proof-of-concepts into practical breakthroughs. Applications of these methods span various domains, including the computation of volumes of semialgebraic sets, periods of complex varieties, algebraic geometry, Diophantine approximations, Feynman integrals, and optimization problems. Significant features of the project include its potential to achieve reliability in the results, the applicability of its methodology across disciplines, and the creation of computational tools and databases documenting ranges of behavior for complex algebraic varieties.\n\nRecent successes such as the Picard group computation demonstrate the viability and transformative potential of the proposed methods. The grant will support the continuation and expansion of this groundbreaking work, promising substantial advancements in computational mathematics and its applications."

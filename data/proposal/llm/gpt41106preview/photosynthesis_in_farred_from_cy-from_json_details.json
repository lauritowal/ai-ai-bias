        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Photosynthesis in far-red: from cyanobacteria to plants\n\nGlobal food production faces the challenge of meeting the demands of a growing population under the constraints of limited arable land and climate change. The efficiency of photosynthesis in crops, currently less than 1%, plays a critical role in biomass production. A significant limitation is that plants only utilize the visible part of the solar spectrum (400-700 nm), resulting in over 50% of the solar photons being discarded. Recent discoveries of cyanobacteria species growing under far-red light (>700 nm)—beyond the previously accepted 700 nm thermodynamic limit of oxygenic photosynthesis—offer a promising avenue for enhancing crop photosynthesis by expanding the light absorption spectrum.\n\nThe proposed project, \"Photosynthesis in far-red: from cyanobacteria to plants,\" seeks to address the knowledge gaps related to the synthesis of novel pigments, their integration into photosynthetic proteins, the impact on photochemical efficiency, and the regulation of photosynthesis. The project aims to elucidate the mechanisms of far-red light acclimation in cyanobacteria and re-design these mechanisms for compatibility with plant photosynthetic systems.\n\nUtilizing a combination of in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches, and techniques such as molecular biology, ultrafast spectroscopy, and modeling—our research group's trademark—the feasibility of implementing a far-red response in plants will be determined, and the potential benefits for crop enhancement will be assessed.\n\nThe outcomes of this research may redefine the limits of photosynthetic efficiency and offer a novel strategy to increase light-use efficiency in crops. By extending the photosynthetic range into the far-red spectrum, this project has the potential to significantly impact global food production through the development of crops capable of harnessing a greater proportion of the solar spectrum.\n\nKeywords: Photosynthesis, Far-red light, Cyanobacteria, Crop enhancement, Biomass conversion efficiency."

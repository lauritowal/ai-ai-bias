        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Tension of ENDOmembranes maintained by TORC1\" seeks to elucidate the regulatory roles of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, in cellular membrane tension homeostasis. TOR is a pivotal serine/threonine protein kinase that integrates nutrient cues to orchestrate cell growth. While TORC1 is sensitive to the immunosuppressant rapamycin, influencing biomass synthesis and turnover, TORC2 is rapamycin-insensitive and maintains plasma membrane tension via a mechanotransduction pathway. Although the TORC2 structure has been solved, this proposal aims to further explore its function and regulation, particularly its TOROID-like inactive structure under glucose depletion.\n\nThis research will develop novel chemical tools, including small molecules to dissipate plasma membrane tension and a biosensor to measure it. The project will employ an array of cutting-edge techniques such as genetic screens, quantitative phosphoproteomics, in vitro assays, high-throughput compound screens, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) imaging, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to:\n\n1. Determine how TORC1 regulates vacuolar membrane tension, thereby uncovering new dimensions of its role in cell physiology.\n2. Characterize the TOROID-like structure of TORC2 upon glucose depletion to reveal new mechanisms in growth control and regulatory details of TORC1 and TORC2.\n\nThe implications of this work are vast, offering insights that could inform therapeutic interventions targeting these medically relevant signaling complexes. Understanding the interplay between nutrient availability and membrane tension could revolutionize our approach to diseases linked to dysregulated cell growth and metabolism. By unraveling the intricate control mechanisms of TORC1 and TORC2, this project stands to provide a significant leap forward in the field of cellular and molecular biology."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Tension of ENDOmembranes maintained by TORC1,\" aims to unravel the complex regulatory functions of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) protein complexes— specifically TORC1 and TORC2— which play critical roles in cellular growth control mechanisms. TORC1 is sensitive to the drug rapamycin and is pivotal in coupling nutrient cues to biomass synthesis and turnover. Conversely, TORC2, which we have rendered rapamycin-sensitive through variant creation, is involved in the mechanotransduction pathway, maintaining plasma membrane (PM) tension homeostasis. Our research will focus on how TORC1 regulates vacuolar membrane (VM) tension and the structural dynamics of TORC2 under glucose depletion.\n\nWe have developed small molecules as chemical tools: a plasma membrane tension dissipator and a biosensor of PM tension. These tools, along with genetic screens, phosphoproteomics, in vitro assays, high-throughput compound screens, and advanced imaging techniques such as Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), and cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM), will be employed to achieve our research goals.\n\nThe first aim is to determine the regulatory impact of TORC1 on VM tension, considering its inactive form as a TOROID and its active regulation through assembly into an inactive helix. The second aim is to elucidate the structural changes in the TOROID-like structure of TORC2 upon glucose depletion, leveraging the solved structure of TORC2 to gain insight into its function.\n\nThis project promises to reveal new mechanisms in growth control and intricacies in TORC1 and TORC2 regulation that could potentially guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions for conditions related to these medically significant signaling complexes. Overall, the study will provide a deeper understanding of the connections between nutrient signaling, membrane tension, and cellular growth, with broad implications for biomedical research and drug design.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Tension of ENDOmembranes maintained by TORC1\" aims to illuminate the intricacies of endomembrane tension regulation by targeting the TOR (Target of Rapamycin) signaling pathway. TOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase, forms two distinct multiprotein complexes: TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin and plays a pivotal role in coupling nutrient availability to cellular growth processes, whereas TORC2, which is rapamycin-insensitive, is involved in the mechanotransduction pathway and maintains plasma membrane tension homeostasis.\n\nOur research will delve into the TORC1-mediated regulation of vacuolar membrane tension. We have developed small-molecule chemical tools, including a plasma membrane tension dissipator and a biosensor, to aid in elucidating this process. Our methodologies encompass the development of chemical probes, genetic screens, quantitative phosphoproteomics, various in vitro assays, high-throughput compound screens, super-resolution STORM imaging, FRAP imaging, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).\n\nA crucial component of our proposal is the determination of the TORC1 inactive conformation, termed the TOROID structure, and its regulation. Additionally, we plan to solve the TOROID-like structure of TORC2 upon glucose depletion, which will provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms governing cell growth control. The creation of a rapamycin-sensitive variant of TORC2 further augments our toolkit for dissecting the pathway's regulation.\n\nThe outcomes of this research are poised to reveal novel mechanisms in growth control and furnish detailed understanding of TORC1 and TORC2 regulation. The implications are far-reaching, potentially informing the development of new therapeutic interventions for diseases linked to dysregulation of these medically relevant signaling complexes. Our major aim is to determine if and how TORC1 regulates vacuolar membrane tension, thereby enhancing our comprehension of cellular homeostasis and growth.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Tension of ENDOmembranes maintained by TORC1\n\nThe intricate regulation of cellular growth and homeostasis is a fundamental aspect of biology with profound implications for understanding and treating human diseases. The proposed project, \"Tension of ENDOmembranes maintained by TORC1,\" aims to elucidate the regulatory functions of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) protein complexes—TORC1 and TORC2—in maintaining cellular membrane tension. TORC1 and TORC2 are serine/threonine protein kinases crucial for coupling nutrient cues to cellular processes and mechanotransduction pathways, respectively.\n\nOur research will delve into the sensitive nature of TORC1 to rapamycin and the previously solved structure of TORC2. Additionally, a rapamycin-sensitive variant of TORC2 has been created, furthering our understanding of these complexes. The project has developed small molecules, including a plasma membrane tension dissipator and a biosensor, which will be instrumental in probing the TOR pathways.\n\nThe research is structured around two major aims: First, to determine the regulatory role of TORC1 in vacuolar membrane (VM) tension through an array of techniques including the development of chemical probes, genetic screens, quantitative phosphoproteomics, in vitro assays, high-throughput compound screens, and advanced imaging methods such as Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), and cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Second, we will resolve the TOROID-like structure of TORC2 under glucose-depleted conditions, which is expected to reveal novel insights into growth control mechanisms.\n\nThis investigation promises to uncover new mechanisms of growth control and provide critical details on the regulation of TORC1 and TORC2. The outcomes of this study have the potential to inform future therapeutic interventions targeting these medically relevant signaling complexes, thereby addressing a wide range of pathological conditions stemming from dysregulated cellular growth and membrane dynamics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Tension of ENDOmembranes maintained by TORC1\" seeks to elucidate the regulatory roles of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, in cellular membrane tension homeostasis. TOR is a pivotal serine/threonine protein kinase that integrates nutrient cues to orchestrate cell growth. While TORC1 is sensitive to the immunosuppressant rapamycin, influencing biomass synthesis and turnover, TORC2 is rapamycin-insensitive and maintains plasma membrane tension via a mechanotransduction pathway. Although the TORC2 structure has been solved, this proposal aims to further explore its function and regulation, particularly its TOROID-like inactive structure under glucose depletion.\n\nThis research will develop novel chemical tools, including small molecules to dissipate plasma membrane tension and a biosensor to measure it. The project will employ an array of cutting-edge techniques such as genetic screens, quantitative phosphoproteomics, in vitro assays, high-throughput compound screens, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) imaging, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to:\n\n1. Determine how TORC1 regulates vacuolar membrane tension, thereby uncovering new dimensions of its role in cell physiology.\n2. Characterize the TOROID-like structure of TORC2 upon glucose depletion to reveal new mechanisms in growth control and regulatory details of TORC1 and TORC2.\n\nThe implications of this work are vast, offering insights that could inform therapeutic interventions targeting these medically relevant signaling complexes. Understanding the interplay between nutrient availability and membrane tension could revolutionize our approach to diseases linked to dysregulated cell growth and metabolism. By unraveling the intricate control mechanisms of TORC1 and TORC2, this project stands to provide a significant leap forward in the field of cellular and molecular biology."

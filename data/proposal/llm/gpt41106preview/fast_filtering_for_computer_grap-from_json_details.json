        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Fast Filtering for Computer Graphics, Vision and Computational Sciences\n\nThe evolution of high-resolution sensors and intricate computational methods in fields such as digital signal processing, computer graphics, vision, and image processing has introduced a critical demand for faster and more efficient filtering techniques. Current filtering procedures, particularly for linear time-invariant (LTI) and non-linear spatially-varying filters, pose significant challenges due to their computational complexity, high memory costs, and time-consuming operations, which are currently exacerbated at high resolutions and on devices with limited CPU power.\n\nThis proposal aims to address these fundamental shortcomings by deriving fast, linear-time procedures for various filter types, including LTI and efficient edge-aware filters, both explicit and implicit. We intend to exploit the intrinsic connection between convolution, spatially-homogeneous elliptic equations, and the multigrid method to not only improve existing filtering processes but also to develop novel multiscale filtering procedures that mimic inhomogeneous diffusion operators.\n\nOur research goals include the derivation of novel multi-level image decomposition strategies that can efficiently analyze, process, and synthesize images. These strategies will be inspired by multiscale matrix preconditioning and will contribute to the design of new biorthogonal second-generation wavelets. Moreover, we propose to establish a new multiscale preconditioning paradigm that synergizes algebraic multigrid with combinatorial matrix preconditioning, overcoming the severe memory costs and truncation errors associated with acceleration methods for non-linear filters.\n\nThe anticipated outcome is a significant leap forward in the efficiency and capability of computer graphics and image processing applications, allowing for rapid and accurate filtering processes even in resource-constrained environments. This project holds the promise of catalyzing advancements across a multitude of computational disciplines that depend on sophisticated filtering techniques."

        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a research initiative designed to enhance environmental policy-making efficacy in the context of global climate change and regional air pollution, both predominantly caused by the combustion of fossil fuels. Despite significant environmental quality improvements in Europe, the need for advanced regulatory measures remains pivotal. This project aims to balance the economic costs of reducing fossil fuel combustion with its health-related damages by introducing novel empirical models that offer greater spatial precision in economic impact analyses. Integrating interdisciplinary methodologies, the project will establish a causal link between pollution emissions and air pollutant transport models while evaluating subclinical and long-term health effects of air pollution for inclusion in economic damage assessments.\n\nThe research will be conducted in two parts. The first part investigates the economic consequences of local air quality alterations resulting from the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, an initiative not primarily aimed at affecting air quality. The second part examines the effects of air pollution on labor supply, health outcomes, and migration patterns, utilizing a comprehensive empirical framework. The project's central mission is to supply empirical data to guide environmental policy in areas such as climate action and air quality control.\n\nAnticipating a broad impact due to the project's innovative strategies, global relevance of the environmental challenges addressed, and its policy-centric orientation, this proposal seeks funding to empower the pursuit of these vital environmental analyses. The anticipated findings are expected to significantly influence policy development, ensuring that environmental regulations are both economically feasible and effective in improving public health and mitigating climate change."

Notwithstanding such improvements, environmental regulation continues to be a top priority for policy makers in Europe and other post-industrial societies. Global climate change is an important reason for this. Increasing demand for environmental quality is another one, explaining why some of the richest agglomerations in Europe have been adopting very costly measures to further reduce air pollution. Both global climate change and regional air pollution originate to a large extent from the combustion of fossil fuels, an activity that, in Europe, is costly to curb but also causes substantial damage to human health. This project contributes new tools for assessing this trade-off by (i) developing empirical models that greatly enhance spatial detail in state-of-the-art economic impact analysis, (ii) pioneering an interdisciplinary approach that links causal inference on pollution emissions at the source to chemical transport models for air pollutants, and (iii) incorporating subclinical and long-term health impacts of air pollution into economic damage estimates. Part I of the project studies the economic implications of changes in local air quality that were an unintended consequence of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme for carbon dioxide. Part II analyzes the impacts of air pollution on labor supply, health, and migration in a unified empirical framework. The key objective of this project is to provide empirical evidence that can inform environmental policy-making in the broad contexts of climate policy and air quality management. Given the ambitious concepts proposed, the global significance of the environmental problems addressed, and the focus on policy, this project has the potential to make a large impact.",

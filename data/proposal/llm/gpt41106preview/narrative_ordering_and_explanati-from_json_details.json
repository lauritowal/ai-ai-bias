        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives\" aims to critically examine the role of narrative in the development and communication of scientific knowledge. Despite narratives being pervasive across the human, social, and natural sciences over the past two centuries, their significance extends beyond mere reporting. This project seeks to address the knowledge gap regarding the types of knowledge narrative yields and how it is constituted within scientific practices, with a specific focus on fields that have historically neglected narrative studies, except in medicine and evolutionary biology.\n\nCentral research questions include: What do scientists gain from using narratives, and what functions do narratives fulfill in the scientific process? Preliminary research suggests that narratives contribute to creating coherence and fitting diverse elements together in research. The project will investigate the variability of narrative ordering, which exhibits differences from site to site and from one scientific discipline to another, as evidenced by case studies from nineteenth-century biology, mid-twentieth-century sociology, and modern computer-based simulations.\n\nThe project's scope is broad, involving numerous case studies to explore narratives in real and virtual situations, empirical work, and theorizing. One of the major challenges is to make sense of the variety of narrative use across the sciences. However, a common thread identified is that narratives often function to answer scientific questions and provide explanations, thereby contributing to the construction of scientific knowledge.\n\nThis research will fill a critical gap in our understanding of how narrative knowing is constituted and the roles it plays across different scientific contexts. By elucidating the diverse functions and applications of narrative in the sciences, the project will significantly advance our comprehension of science as a narrative practice, enhancing the way we perceive the construction of knowledge within the scientific community."

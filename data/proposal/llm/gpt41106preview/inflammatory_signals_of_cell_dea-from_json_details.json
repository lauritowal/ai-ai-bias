        "Abstract:\n\nThe FIREALARM project seeks to elucidate the physiological origins of sterile inflammation, with a particular focus on how endogenous intercellular signaling proteins contribute to the transition from a homeostatic state to non-resolving chronic inflammatory conditions. This project integrates system-wide, organismal, cell biological, and molecular approaches to explore the intricate networks underlying inflammation. The central hypothesis posits that pyroptosis—a form of programmed cell death—is a key paracrine activity that releases signals leading to sterile inflammation in both metabolic and age-related disorders.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the project will employ a range of innovative research methods, including systematic iterative ablation of molecule release from dying cells, perception pathways of sentinel cells, and cell type-specific mass spectrometry-based secretomics technologies. The objectives are to determine the paracrine activities of pyroptosis, identify inflammatory signals in vitro and in vivo, achieve a molecular and organismal understanding of intercellular circuits, conceive strategies to revert chronic conditions, and stratify the molecular etiology and outcomes of patients with sterile inflammatory diseases.\n\nExpected outcomes of the FIREALARM project include a new level of understanding of the molecular language orchestrating communication networks between cells, the recognition of signals initiating, amplifying, and resolving inflammation, and the identification of emerging inflammatory cell death markers. These findings will have a profound impact on our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic metabolic and age-related disorders, potentially leading to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

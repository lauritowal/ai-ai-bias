        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Re-thinking Psychological Acculturation: From Explicit to Implicit Cultural Affiliations\" (PsychAcc) project proposes a groundbreaking approach to understanding the acculturation process of ethnic minorities in Europe, which comprise 29% of the population. With a focus on ethnic minority and majority youth aged 14-18 in Belgium, the project aims to delve into the implicit dimensions of acculturation—self-construal, cognition, and motivation—that complement the traditional explicit cultural attitudes and identities.\n\nPsychAcc is designed to conduct a series of four studies including cross-cultural, a 2-year representative longitudinal, experimental, and observational methodologies to prove acculturation effects on the self-construal, cognition, and motivation of participants. This initiative seeks to elucidate the complex interplay between explicit and implicit cultural affiliations, identify distinct acculturative profiles, predict outcomes related to well-being and education, and reveal the micro-processes that occur during majority-minority interactions.\n\nThe project's innovative methodology employs a beyond-state-of-the-art methodological toolbox that will not only provide a novel theoretical framework for psychological acculturation but will also offer pivotal evidence to support a paradigm shift in acculturation research. Through this investigative lens, PsychAcc aims to generate new research lines within the social sciences and influence policymakers' perspectives on the integration of ethnic minorities.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of PsychAcc is a novel theory and an advanced methodological toolbox that will redefine the field of acculturation research. The project's implications are profound, suggesting a paradigm shift that will reshape both academic inquiry and policy development concerning the integration of ethnic minorities in European societies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Re-thinking Psychological Acculturation: From Explicit to Implicit Cultural Affiliations\" (PsychAcc) aims to revolutionize our understanding of how acculturation shapes the psyches of ethnic minorities and majorities in Europe, particularly focusing on youth aged 14-18 in Belgium. Despite ethnic minorities constituting 29% of European citizens, traditional acculturation research has predominantly focused on explicit cultural attitudes and identities. PsychAcc seeks to extend this by investigating implicit aspects such as self-construal, cognition, and motivation.\n\nThis innovative project will conduct four methodologically diverse studies: a cross-cultural study, a two-year representative longitudinal study, an experimental study, and an observational study. These will provide evidence to prove the role of acculturation in shaping self-construal, cognition, and motivation, and will elucidate the complex interplay between explicit and implicit cultural affiliations. Furthermore, PsychAcc aims to identify distinct acculturative profiles and predict their impact on well-being and educational outcomes.\n\nThe outcomes of PsychAcc are expected to yield a novel theoretical framework and an advanced methodological toolbox that will prompt a paradigm shift in acculturation research. This will not only open new lines of enquiry in the social sciences but will also influence policy makers to reconsider existing notions of 'integration'.\n\nBy revealing the micro-processes in majority-minority interactions and providing pivotal evidence, PsychAcc strives to impact academic discourse and foster a more nuanced understanding of the acculturative experiences of young people in multi-ethnic societies. Ultimately, the project will contribute significantly to the scientific community and to the design of more effective socio-cultural policies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Re-thinking Psychological Acculturation: From Explicit to Implicit Cultural Affiliations\n\nWith ethnic minorities comprising 29% of European citizens, understanding the processes of psychological acculturation is critical for fostering inclusive societies. The PsychAcc project aims to revolutionize the field by proving acculturation beyond explicit cultural attitudes and identities, investigating implicit factors such as self-construal, cognition, and motivation. This innovative research targets ethnic minority and majority youth (14-18y) in Belgium, reflecting the diversity of European populations.\n\nPsychAcc proposes an interdisciplinary approach with four methodologically diverse studies—a cross-cultural study, a representative 2-year longitudinal study, an experimental study, and an observational study—to explore the interplay between explicit and implicit cultural affiliations. Objectives include elucidating the micro-processes in majority-minority interactions, identifying distinct acculturative profiles, and predicting outcomes related to well-being and education. This beyond-state-of-the-art methodological toolbox will enable the capture of dynamic acculturative processes.\n\nBy integrating novel theoretical insights with empirical evidence, PsychAcc aims to trigger a paradigm shift in acculturation research, contributing to the development of new research lines in social sciences. The outcomes are expected to inform policy makers and contribute to a re-conceptualization of 'integration' strategies. Ultimately, the project promises to advance our knowledge on how individuals navigate cultural identities implicitly, providing a foundation for more effective socio-cultural integration policies that recognize the complexity of acculturation in modern societies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Re-thinking Psychological Acculturation: From Explicit to Implicit Cultural Affiliations\" (PsychAcc) seeks to challenge and enrich current understandings of psychological acculturation by focusing on both explicit and implicit cultural affiliations among ethnic minorities, which constitute 29% of the European population. This innovative research will explore how self-construal, cognition, and motivation—core components of implicit cultural affiliations—interact with explicit cultural attitudes and identities within the acculturation process. The primary goals of PsychAcc are to: 1) demonstrate how acculturation manifests in these implicit dimensions, 2) elucidate the complex interplay between explicit and implicit cultural affiliations, 3) identify distinct acculturative profiles, 4) predict the impact on well-being and educational outcomes, and 5) reveal the nuanced micro-processes in majority-minority interactions.\n\nThe project will employ a comprehensive methodology including a cross-cultural study, a 2-year representative longitudinal study, an experimental study, and an observational study with ethnic minority and majority youth (ages 14-18) in Belgium. This methodological diversity ensures a robust investigation into the multi-faceted nature of acculturation.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of PsychAcc is the development of a novel theoretical framework and an advanced methodological toolbox that will initiate a paradigm shift in acculturation research. The implications of this project are profound, promising to open new research lines in the social sciences and urging policy makers to reconsider notions of 'integration.' PsychAcc is poised to provide pivotal evidence and a fresh perspective that could reshape the discourse on psychological acculturation and its role in the lives of ethnic minorities in Europe."

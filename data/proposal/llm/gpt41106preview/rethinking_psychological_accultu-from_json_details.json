        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Re-thinking Psychological Acculturation: From Explicit to Implicit Cultural Affiliations\" (PsychAcc) seeks to challenge and enrich current understandings of psychological acculturation by focusing on both explicit and implicit cultural affiliations among ethnic minorities, which constitute 29% of the European population. This innovative research will explore how self-construal, cognition, and motivation—core components of implicit cultural affiliations—interact with explicit cultural attitudes and identities within the acculturation process. The primary goals of PsychAcc are to: 1) demonstrate how acculturation manifests in these implicit dimensions, 2) elucidate the complex interplay between explicit and implicit cultural affiliations, 3) identify distinct acculturative profiles, 4) predict the impact on well-being and educational outcomes, and 5) reveal the nuanced micro-processes in majority-minority interactions.\n\nThe project will employ a comprehensive methodology including a cross-cultural study, a 2-year representative longitudinal study, an experimental study, and an observational study with ethnic minority and majority youth (ages 14-18) in Belgium. This methodological diversity ensures a robust investigation into the multi-faceted nature of acculturation.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of PsychAcc is the development of a novel theoretical framework and an advanced methodological toolbox that will initiate a paradigm shift in acculturation research. The implications of this project are profound, promising to open new research lines in the social sciences and urging policy makers to reconsider notions of 'integration.' PsychAcc is poised to provide pivotal evidence and a fresh perspective that could reshape the discourse on psychological acculturation and its role in the lives of ethnic minorities in Europe."

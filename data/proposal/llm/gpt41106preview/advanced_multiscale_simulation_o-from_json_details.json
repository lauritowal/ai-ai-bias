        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Advanced Multiscale Simulation of DNA\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for the development of groundbreaking multiscale simulation technology for DNA, a project that aims to revolutionize our understanding of genomic structure and function. Current simulation techniques are hindered by biases in classical force-fields and are limited to atomistic procedures that can only model up to 100 base pairs. To overcome these challenges, this project proposes a comprehensive suite of objectives, including the development of a polarized force-field, parametrization against experimental and theoretical data, and the creation of a MoDEL-like database of DNA trajectories.\n\nThe multiscale approach covers the entire DNA scale range from the Å-scale of the nucleobase to the m-scale of the human genome, effectively allowing for analysis from 100 base pairs to the full human genome. The methodology involves the development of new, dynamic-based strategies for coarse-grained simulations and a novel mesoscopic model that moves beyond the harmonic nearest-neighbors model. This model will address the limitations of current simulation practices by enabling the study of DNA sequences in various states, including their physical properties, chromatin structure, epigenetic signatures, and gene regulation.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project are significant. With the proposed technology, researchers will be able to analyze the fine details of genome structure and regulation, and connect the physical properties of DNA with broader biological phenomena. The project comprises four stages: the development of a polarized force-field, the analysis and database creation for DNA sequences, the derivation of strategies for ultra-fast and accurate simulations, and the development of a new mesoscopic model.\n\nThis initiative promises to deliver a transformative tool for the scientific community, providing insights into the fundamental processes of life and paving the way for advancements in genetics, medicine, and biotechnology."

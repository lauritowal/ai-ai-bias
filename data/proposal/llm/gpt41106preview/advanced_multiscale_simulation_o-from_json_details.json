        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'Advanced Multiscale Simulation of DNA' project aims to revolutionize the field of DNA research by overcoming current limitations in simulation technology. The project seeks to address critical issues such as biases inherent in classical force-fields and the constraints of atomistic procedures to systems no larger than 100 base pairs. To tackle these challenges, the project will develop a novel multiscale simulation technology, enabling comprehensive coverage from the smallest scale of nucleobases (Å-scale) to the full human genome (m-scale).\n\nThe proposed methodology includes the development of a polarized force-field specifically parameterized against both experimental and theoretical data. Moreover, there will be a concerted effort to create a MoDEL-like database of DNA trajectories, which will significantly enhance the analysis of DNA sequences in various states. The project will also derive advanced coarse-grained and essential dynamic-based strategies for ultra-fast and accurate simulations, extending the capability to medium and long DNA segments. A pioneering mesoscopic model is also planned, surpassing traditional harmonic nearest-neighbors approaches, to account for multimodality and neutralization-induced deformations in DNA.\n\nWith these technological advancements, the project expects to provide unprecedented insights into the fine details of genome structure and regulation. By effectively connecting the physical properties of DNA with chromatin structure, epigenetic signatures, and gene regulation, the project will facilitate a deeper understanding of how genetic information is stored, accessed, and utilized within living organisms. This comprehensive approach will enable researchers to analyze genome structure, gene regulation, and correlate physical properties with epigenetic signatures, thereby opening new avenues for genetic research and potential applications in biotechnology and personalized medicine.",
        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Advanced Multiscale Simulation of DNA\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering project aimed at developing a novel multiscale simulation technology to comprehensively study DNA, spanning from the nucleobase to the human genome scale. The initiative confronts the limitations of classical force-fields, which introduce biases, and the constraints of atomistic procedures that are currently limited to simulations of approximately 100 base pairs. Through the proposed research, we intend to bridge these gaps by creating an innovative polarized force-field, a comprehensive database of DNA trajectories akin to the MoDEL project, and advanced simulation strategies that are both coarse-grained and essential dynamic-based.\n\nThe project will proceed in four stages. The first stage involves the development of a polarized force-field parameterized against both experimental and theoretical data. The second stage will analyze DNA sequences in various states and establish a trajectory database. In the third stage, we will derive strategies for ultra-fast and accurate simulations applicable to medium to long DNA segments. The final stage will see the development of a new mesoscopic model that accounts for multimodality and the deformations induced by neutralization.\n\nOur technological advancements will include a multiscale simulation technology, a polarized force-field tailored to DNA, a database capturing DNA trajectories, refined coarse-grained and essential dynamic-based strategies, and a mesoscopic model that surpasses the harmonic nearest-neighbors model. The coverage will extend from the Å-scale of nucleobases to the m-scale of the human genome, effectively spanning from 100 base pairs to the entirety of the human genome.\n\nThe expected outcomes are multifold. We anticipate being able to analyze the fine details of genome structure and regulation, as well as establishing a clear connection between the physical properties of DNA, chromatin structure, epigenetic signatures, and gene regulation. This comprehensive approach is poised to revolutionize our understanding of DNA's role in biology, offering profound implications for genetics, biotechnology, and medicine.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"Advanced multiscale simulation of DNA\" seeks to revolutionize the simulation of DNA by overcoming the current limitations of classical force-field biases and the restriction of atomistic procedures to systems no larger than 100 base pairs. By extending the simulation target range from the scale of a nucleobase to the full scope of the human genome, the project aims to create a comprehensive multiscale simulation technology that accurately represents DNA at all levels of complexity. \n\nThe proposed methodology involves the development of a polarized force-field, parametrization against both experimental and theoretical data, and the analysis of DNA sequences in various states.

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Information Technology and Institutions Supporting Human Capital Accumulation and Exchange,\" aims to explore the profound impacts of the European Renaissance's information technology revolution on human capital development and idea exchange. The project focuses on the transformative role of printing and draws parallels with contemporary technological shifts, such as the Internet. It intends to document these impacts through a historical lens, utilizing a rich array of data sources and innovative methodological approaches.\n\nThe project's core objective is to analyze the long-term effects of revolutions in information technology and institutional frameworks on the production, diffusion, and institutionalization of ideas, with a particular emphasis on the European Renaissance. This period is characterized by significant advancements in printing technology, which facilitated widespread dissemination of knowledge and facilitated cultural and intellectual exchanges.\n\nMethodologically, the project will leverage high-dimensional estimators to analyze micro-data on media markets, human capital, and institutions. It will also employ historical sources of exogenous variation, such as local shocks and archival data, to establish causal relationships. The data will include firm-level records on all known books in German-speaking Europe from 1450 to 1600, city laws regarding public education, data on German university students from 1400 to 1550, and comprehensive records of European scholarly societies and journals.\n\nThe research is structured into three strands: (1) assessing the impact of competitive dynamics on the diffusion of ideas and institutional change during the Protestant Reformation, (2) investigating the origins of persistent disparities in human capital accumulation from 1400 to 1550, and (3) evaluating the influence of knowledge-disseminating organizations, such as scholarly societies and journals, in complementing the printing revolution.\n\nBy documenting these historical transformations, the research promises to provide valuable insights into the long-run effects of information technology revolutions on culture, institutions, and human capital, offering implications for understanding modern-day technological shifts and their potential societal impacts."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype (ADaPt): Understanding the Roles of Climate, Natural Selection, and Energetics in Shaping Global Hunter-Gatherer Adaptability\n\nThe ADaPt project seeks to unravel the complex interplay between climate, natural selection, and energetics that has led to significant human biological diversity, despite high genetic homogeneity. The primary objective is to document and interpret the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene and examine how environmental factors and skeletal variations have contributed to human adaptability. This research will fill a critical gap in our understanding of the mechanisms interpreting the archaeological record and the relationships among genetic phylogenies, climate, and physical variation.\n\nOur multifaceted approach includes a detailed study of skeletal variation and its correspondence with genetic and climatic history. By integrating these findings with experimental research on energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation in living humans, we will directly test the adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. This approach allows us to examine living human adaptability to different environments through energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs.\n\nThe expected outcomes of ADaPt are far-reaching. We aim to provide the first conclusive links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and the evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics. This will not only allow us to infer the mechanisms driving variation but will also improve our interpretation of variation in the archaeological record, thereby enhancing our understanding of human dispersals and adaptation throughout history. Ultimately, ADaPt will shed light on the adaptability of our species, contributing to a more nuanced view of human evolution.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype\" (ADaPt), aims to unravel the intricate relationship between climate, natural selection, and energetics in crafting the adaptability of global hunter-gatherers. Despite high genetic homogeneity among humans, there is significant biological diversity, particularly evident in skeletal variation. However, the mechanisms interpreting this variation in the archaeological record remain poorly understood. ADaPt seeks to document and interpret the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene, test the relationship between environmental factors and skeletal variations, examine the adaptability of living humans to various environments through energetic expenditure, and investigate the relationship between muscle and skeletal variation due to different forms of locomotion.\n\nThe research will be conducted in two main components: a detailed study of global hunter-gatherer variation and experimental research on energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation in living humans. The project aims to test the correspondence between skeletal variation and genetic/climatic history and directly test the adaptive implications of skeletal variations observed in the past. By integrating skeletal variations with experimental studies of living humans, ADaPt will infer mechanisms driving variation and test adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the archaeological record.\n\nExpected outcomes include interpretation of variation in the archaeological record and an understanding of human dispersals and adaptation in the past. By providing the first links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics, ADaPt will illuminate the factors that have shaped our species' success over millennia, offering invaluable insights into human adaptability and resilience.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype\" (ADaPt) seeks to unravel the complexities of human adaptability by examining the intricate interplay between climate, natural selection, and energetics in shaping global hunter-gatherer populations. Despite the genetic homogeneity of humans, significant biological diversity is evident, particularly in skeletal variation. This diversity remains poorly understood, particularly in relation to the mechanisms that interpret the archaeological record of our past. \n\nADaPt aims to document and interpret the patterns of variation among global hunter-gatherer populations during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, examining the relationship between environmental factors and skeletal adaptations. The project will conduct experimental research on living humans to understand energetic stress, muscle function, and bone variation, and how these factors are influenced by locomotion in diverse environments. Through this integrative approach, the project will test the correspondence between skeletal variation and genetic and climatic history, and directly assess the adaptive implications of skeletal variations observed in prehistoric populations.\n\nExpected outcomes include a comprehensive interpretation of variation in the archaeological record and an enhanced understanding of human dispersals and adaptation throughout history. By providing the first links between prehistoric hunter-gatherer variation and the evolutionary parameters of life history and energetics, ADaPt promises to shed light on the factors that have shaped human success as a species. This project is poised to transform our understanding of human adaptability and evolution, contributing critical insights to the fields of anthropology, archaeology, and evolutionary biology.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project 'Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype' (ADaPt) seeks to unravel the complex interplay of climate, natural selection, and energetics in shaping the adaptability of global hunter-gatherer populations throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Despite high genetic homogeneity, significant human biological diversity is evident, particularly in skeletal variation. However, there is a profound lack of understanding of the mechanisms interpreting these variations within the archaeological record.\n\nADaPt aims to document and interpret the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation, test the relationship between environmental and skeletal variation, examine the adaptability of living humans to different environments through energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs, and investigate the link between muscle and skeletal variation due to locomotion in diverse environments. This will be achieved through a detailed study of past populations and experimental research on muscle function and bone variation in living humans.\n\nThe project's goals are to test the correspondence between skeletal variation and genetic and climatic history, and directly test the adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. By integrating skeletal variation with experimental studies of living humans, ADaPt will provide novel insights into the evolutionary parameters that have shaped human success as a species.\n\nExpected outcomes include a comprehensive interpretation of variation in the archaeological record and a deeper understanding of human dispersals and adaptation strategies in the past. Through this innovative research, ADaPt will contribute to our knowledge of human adaptability, informing both our evolutionary history and our ability to thrive in diverse environments."

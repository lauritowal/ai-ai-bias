        "Abstract:\n\nThe project 'Adaptation, Dispersals and Phenotype' (ADaPt) seeks to unravel the complex interplay of climate, natural selection, and energetics in shaping the adaptability of global hunter-gatherer populations throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Despite high genetic homogeneity, significant human biological diversity is evident, particularly in skeletal variation. However, there is a profound lack of understanding of the mechanisms interpreting these variations within the archaeological record.\n\nADaPt aims to document and interpret the pattern of global hunter-gatherer variation, test the relationship between environmental and skeletal variation, examine the adaptability of living humans to different environments through energetic expenditure and life history trade-offs, and investigate the link between muscle and skeletal variation due to locomotion in diverse environments. This will be achieved through a detailed study of past populations and experimental research on muscle function and bone variation in living humans.\n\nThe project's goals are to test the correspondence between skeletal variation and genetic and climatic history, and directly test the adaptive implications of skeletal variation observed in the past. By integrating skeletal variation with experimental studies of living humans, ADaPt will provide novel insights into the evolutionary parameters that have shaped human success as a species.\n\nExpected outcomes include a comprehensive interpretation of variation in the archaeological record and a deeper understanding of human dispersals and adaptation strategies in the past. Through this innovative research, ADaPt will contribute to our knowledge of human adaptability, informing both our evolutionary history and our ability to thrive in diverse environments."

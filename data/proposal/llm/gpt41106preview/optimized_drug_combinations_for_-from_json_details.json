        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces a cutting-edge project titled \"Optimized drug combinations for effective cancer treatment: a personalised approach,\" targeting metastasized colorectal carcinoma (mCRC). Despite advancements in cancer therapy, there is a pressing need for novel treatment strategies following first-line chemotherapy's limited success. Our research focuses on the pivotal phase of identifying and preparing improved therapeutic combination regimens for subsequent testing in cancer patients.\n\nIn previous research, we employed a differential evolution guided stochastic search algorithm paired with a feedback system control (FSC) technique. This innovative methodological duo was tested on nine angiostatic drugs at four different doses, resulting in the discovery of optimal synergistic low-dose drug combinations. These combinations, when translated in vivo, have demonstrated effective anti-cancer activity without inducing side-effects, maintaining the drug dose ratio in preclinical models.\n\nThe proposed research will expand upon this groundwork by screening seven genetically distinct human mCRC cell lines, aiming to simulate personalized treatment. The preclinical models, including orthotopic and metastasizing mouse models, will be compared with standard chemotherapy regimens. The development of a personalized screening method using freshly isolated tumor cells will prepare for clinical application, while the identification and validation of novel tumor endothelium markers will inform the design of new drugs.\n\nOur approach is both translational and multidisciplinary, with the ultimate goal of preparing an improved therapeutic combination regimen for testing in cancer patients with advanced CRC. The innovative strategy, grounded in prior success, promises to not only refine treatment personalization but also to enhance the efficacy and safety of cancer therapies. The project embodies a leap towards precision medicine and opens a pathway for developing targeted therapeutics tailored to individual patient profiles, potentially revolutionizing the management of mCRC and other cancers."

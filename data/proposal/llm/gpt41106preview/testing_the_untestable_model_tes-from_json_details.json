        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Testing the Untestable: Model Testing of Complex Software-Intensive Systems\" (TUNE) project aims to revolutionize the Verification and Validation (V&V) landscape for complex software systems that are central to economic stability, public safety, and national security. As software becomes increasingly intertwined with hardware and continuously interacts with dynamic environments, traditional testing methods have proven to be expensive, time-consuming, and often infeasible. TUNE seeks to address these challenges by elevating the testing process to a higher abstraction levelâ€”focusing on executable models that represent the essential aspects of the system, its environment, and the potential risks associated with system failures.\n\nTUNE will deploy innovative techniques such as metaheuristic search algorithms, model-driven engineering, and automated testing to develop scalable, practical, and uncertainty-aware testing methods. By harnessing these techniques, TUNE will create testing automation on models, capturing dynamic environment behaviors and system unknowns. The innovation lies in shifting the testing paradigm from operational systems to their models, allowing for early detection of issues, cost-effective automation, and significantly improved dependability of software-intensive systems.\n\nThe anticipated impact of the TUNE project includes the enhancement of economic efficiency by reducing the costs associated with V&V of complex systems. It will also increase safety and security by ensuring that critical systems are more reliable and robust against failures. The project's success will not only benefit the field of software engineering but will also have a profound influence on industries and sectors reliant on dependable software systems.\n\nIn conclusion, TUNE is set to transform the V&V process by enabling the testing of previously untestable systems, thereby fostering advancements in the development of critical software-intensive systems that underpin our modern society.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"Testing the Untestable: Model Testing of Complex Software-Intensive Systems\" (TUNE), addresses the crucial challenge of verifying and validating increasingly complex software systems that are vital for economic viability, safety, and security. Traditional testing methods are becoming prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and often infeasible due to the intricate integration of software and hardware and their continuous interactions with dynamic environments. TUNE proposes a revolutionary shift in the verification and validation (V&V) paradigm by raising the level of abstraction of testing from operational systems to executable models that represent relevant system aspects, the surrounding environment, and associated failure risks.\n\nThe TUNE approach leverages test automation on models, utilizing techniques such as metaheuristic search, model-driven engineering, and automated testing to tackle the uncertainties inherent in dynamic environment behaviors and unknowns about the system. By focusing on scalable, practical, and uncertainty-aware model testing, the project aims to facilitate early detection of issues, enable cost-effective automation, and significantly improve the dependability of software-intensive systems.\n\nThe innovation lies in transforming the V&V process to operate on models that capture the essence of the system's interaction with its environment, including the risks of system failures. This allows for a more thorough and efficient testing process that can deal with the complexities and uncertainties of real-world operations.\n\nExpected outcomes of TUNE include the establishment of new methods and tools for model testing that can be applied early in the development cycle, leading to enhanced dependability of critical systems while controlling costs and reducing the time required for testing. Through this project, we aim to set a new standard for software system verification and validation, ensuring the reliability and security of vital systems in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Testing the Untestable: Model Testing of Complex Software-Intensive Systems (TUNE)\n\nAs software-intensive systems become increasingly complex and intertwined with economic, safety, and security concerns, the traditional methods of Verification and Validation (V&V) through operational system testing are facing insurmountable challenges. These challenges include prohibitive costs, extended timeframes, and often complete infeasibility due to the continuous interaction with dynamic environments and the intricate integration of software with hardware components. The TUNE project aims to revolutionize the field by shifting the focus from testing operational systems to testing their models.\n\nTUNE proposes an innovative approach to testing that employs automation on high-level, executable models that represent the relevant aspects of the system, including its environment and the risks associated with system failures. This model-driven engineering strategy is designed to navigate uncertainties, such as unpredictable behaviors within the system's environment and unknowns inherent in the system itself. By leveraging techniques such as metaheuristic search and automated testing, TUNE will create a scalable, practical, and uncertainty-aware testing framework.\n\nThe core innovation of TUNE is to raise the level of abstraction in testing, thereby enabling the testing of formerly untestable systems. By modeling rather than directly interacting with operational systems, TUNE will facilitate early detection of potential issues, resulting in cost-effective automation and significantly improving the dependability of critical software systems.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the TUNE project include the creation of a suite of tools and techniques that will allow stakeholders to address V&V challenges effectively. By providing a means to perform early and cost-effective automation of tests, TUNE seeks to enhance the dependability of systems that are crucial to economic stability, public safety, and national security, ultimately contributing to a more resilient software infrastructure.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Testing the Untestable: Model Testing of Complex Software-Intensive Systems\" (TUNE) addresses the critical need for robust Verification and Validation (V&V) of software systems that are essential for economic stability, public safety, and national security. Traditional testing methods for these systems are increasingly untenable due to their expense, time consumption, and often outright infeasibility, given the complexity of the systems' continuous interaction with dynamic environments and the intricate interplay between software and hardware components.\n\nTUNE proposes a groundbreaking shift in testing philosophy by raising the level of abstraction from operational systems to executable system models that encapsulate essential aspects of the target system and its environment, including potential failure risks. This approach, which leverages test automation on models, confronts the challenges posed by traditional testing by employing innovative techniques such as metaheuristic search, model-driven engineering, and automated testing. These techniques are selected for their scalability, practicality, and ability to account for uncertainties inherent in dynamic system behaviors and unknowns about the systems being tested.\n\nThe innovation of TUNE lies in its ability to enable the testing of previously untestable systems, revolutionizing the concept of test automation through model testing. The expected outcomes of the project include the ability to perform early and cost-effective testing automation, thus significantly improving the dependability of critical software-intensive systems.\n\nBy achieving these goals, TUNE aims to have a profound impact on the fields it touches, offering economic benefits through reduced testing costs, enhancing safety by ensuring system reliability, and bolstering security by verifying system integrity against increasingly sophisticated threats. TUNE represents a major stride in the evolution of software system testing, promising wide-reaching benefits to myriad sectors reliant on complex, software-intensive systems."

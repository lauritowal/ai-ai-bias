        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Testing the Untestable: Model Testing of Complex Software-Intensive Systems\" (TUNE) addresses the critical need for robust Verification and Validation (V&V) of software systems that are essential for economic stability, public safety, and national security. Traditional testing methods for these systems are increasingly untenable due to their expense, time consumption, and often outright infeasibility, given the complexity of the systems' continuous interaction with dynamic environments and the intricate interplay between software and hardware components.\n\nTUNE proposes a groundbreaking shift in testing philosophy by raising the level of abstraction from operational systems to executable system models that encapsulate essential aspects of the target system and its environment, including potential failure risks. This approach, which leverages test automation on models, confronts the challenges posed by traditional testing by employing innovative techniques such as metaheuristic search, model-driven engineering, and automated testing. These techniques are selected for their scalability, practicality, and ability to account for uncertainties inherent in dynamic system behaviors and unknowns about the systems being tested.\n\nThe innovation of TUNE lies in its ability to enable the testing of previously untestable systems, revolutionizing the concept of test automation through model testing. The expected outcomes of the project include the ability to perform early and cost-effective testing automation, thus significantly improving the dependability of critical software-intensive systems.\n\nBy achieving these goals, TUNE aims to have a profound impact on the fields it touches, offering economic benefits through reduced testing costs, enhancing safety by ensuring system reliability, and bolstering security by verifying system integrity against increasingly sophisticated threats. TUNE represents a major stride in the evolution of software system testing, promising wide-reaching benefits to myriad sectors reliant on complex, software-intensive systems."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Defining novel mechanisms critical for colorectal tumourigenesis\" aims to revolutionize our comprehension of oncogenesis by focusing on the full spectrum of genetic mutations present in colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly those occurring at the initiation stage. The advent of cancer genome sequencing has led to a paradigm shift, revealing that while a small number of genes are frequently mutated in CRC, a larger group is mutated less frequently, whose roles in tumourigenesis remain unclear. This study hypothesizes that these infrequently mutated genes contribute significantly to CRC initiation.\n\nThe primary aim is to define the function of all genes mutated in CRC at tumour initiation, with a specific focus on validating and determining the function of a subset of genes not previously described as cancer drivers, thus potentially defining novel cancer mechanisms. The methodology involves a comprehensive whole genome screen in a 3D organoid CRC initiation model, employing CRISPR genetic disruption techniques alongside advanced mouse models and 3D mouse and human organoid cultures.\n\nThe research aims to determine the role of genes mutated in CRC during tumour initiation and to validate and determine the function of identified genes for novel cancer mechanisms. These aims are underpinned by research techniques that include CRISPR genetic disruption, 3D organoid culture systems, and advanced mouse models.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the study are multifold. Firstly, it will establish a foundation for understanding the importance of the entire spectrum of mutations in CRC. Secondly, it will open new avenues of research into the function of these genes. Lastly, it will potentially impact our understanding of tumourigenic mechanisms and influence the development of cancer therapeutics.\n\nIn conclusion, this comprehensive approach will provide critical insights into the previously underappreciated role of infrequently mutated genes in CRC, setting the stage for future advances in cancer research and treatment strategies."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Unveiling the Origins of White-Dwarf Explosions\n\nThe proposed project aims to revolutionize our understanding of white-dwarf explosions, which are essential to heavy element nucleosynthesis, galaxy feedback mechanisms, and the evolution of binary systems. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) not only serve as vital cosmological-distance indicators but also played a significant role in the discovery of the accelerating Universe. Recent high-cadence surveys and theoretical advances have highlighted the existence of alternative white-dwarf explosion scenarios, including disruptions by intermediate-mass black holes, mergers with neutron stars, and collisions within triple systems. These events may represent a diversity of transients, ranging from standard SNe Ia to faint and rapidly evolving explosions.\n\nOur project's central objective is to conduct a complete census of white-dwarf explosion methodologies, map these events to their underlying physics, and constrain the diversity and rates of such explosions in different galactic environments. To achieve this, we will assemble the largest sample of white-dwarf transients ever collected, utilizing both spectroscopic confirmation and detailed follow-up observations. State-of-the-art machine-learning techniques, including neural-network emulators, will facilitate rapid model comparison. This approach will enable us to define optimal samples of SNe Ia for cosmological studies, determine their rates and contributions to the origin of elements, and predict the rates of double white-dwarf detections for future gravitational-wave observatories like LISA.\n\nThe implications of our work are profound, offering insights into nucleosynthetic yields, refining the cosmological utility of white-dwarf explosions, and enhancing predictions for gravitational-wave detection. By confirming and exploring the multiplicity of explosion channels, this project promises to provide critical advancements in both astrophysics and cosmology, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the Universe's structure and evolution.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Unveiling the origins of white-dwarf explosions\" endeavors to revolutionize our understanding of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and exotic white-dwarf transients, pivotal for heavy element nucleosynthesis, galaxy feedback, and the evolution of binary systems. Recognized as fundamental cosmological-distance indicators, SNe Ia were instrumental in the discovery of the accelerating Universe, yet the precise nature of their progenitors remains elusive. This proposal aims to conduct a comprehensive census of white-dwarf explosion mechanisms by leveraging recent advances from high-cadence surveys and theoretical developments that hint at potential alternative explosions such as those involving intermediate-mass black holes, neutron star mergers, and collisions in triple systems.\n\nOur multifaceted approach entails assembling the largest sample of rapidly discovered and spectroscopically confirmed white-dwarf transients, accompanied by detailed follow-up observations. We will employ cutting-edge machine-learning techniques and neural-network emulators for swift explosion model comparisons, aiming to map observations to underlying explosion physics. Furthermore, we plan to rigorously determine the rates and diversity of white-dwarf explosions in different galaxy environments, providing a critical framework for understanding their contributions to element origins.\n\nThe implications of this research are profound; our findings will inform the nucleosynthetic yields of white-dwarf explosions, refine their cosmological utility, and enhance gravitational-wave detection predictions. Notably, the project will define optimal samples of SNe Ia for cosmological studies, ensuring more precise measurements of cosmic expansion. Additionally, we anticipate our results will offer insights into predicting rates of double white-dwarf systems detectable by the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), thereby contributing to the nascent field of multimessenger astronomy.\n\nIn conclusion, this project promises to shed light on the diverse origins of white-dwarf explosions, their roles in cosmic processes, and their potential as tools for cosmological exploration, significantly advancing our understanding of the Universe's dynamic and intricate nature.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Unveiling the Origins of White-Dwarf Explosions\n\nType Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are critical to our understanding of the Universe, serving as cosmological-distance indicators and having led to the discovery of the accelerating Universe. Yet, the specific origins and explosion mechanisms of white dwarfs remain elusive, posing challenges for both astrophysics and cosmology. Our project, \"Unveiling the Origins of White-Dwarf Explosions,\" aims to conduct a comprehensive census of white-dwarf explosion mechanisms, map observational data to explosion physics, and constrain the diversity of these cosmic events.\n\nRecent high-cadence surveys and theoretical advances have pointed to alternative explosion scenarios beyond the classical binary model, such as white dwarfs torn apart by intermediate-mass black holes, mergers with neutron stars, and collisions in triple systems. These potential sources, including faint and rapidly evolving white-dwarf explosions, could significantly impact our understanding of heavy element nucleosynthesis and galaxy feedback, as well as the evolution of binary systems.\n\nWe propose to assemble the largest sample of white-dwarf transients discovered and confirmed through spectroscopy. Detailed follow-up observations will be complemented by cutting-edge machine-learning techniques and neural-network emulators to facilitate rapid model comparisons. Our methods will enable the determination of explosion rates and diversity within different galaxy environments.\n\nThe implications of this work are profound, offering insights into nucleosynthetic yields, refining the cosmological utility of SNe Ia, and improving predictions for gravitational-wave detections, particularly for the upcoming LISA mission. Ultimately, our findings will define optimal samples of SNe Ia for cosmological studies and determine the rates and contributions of white-dwarf explosions to the origins of heavy elements. This project represents a transformative step forward in our quest to understand the explosive endpoints of stellar evolution and their role in shaping the cosmos.",

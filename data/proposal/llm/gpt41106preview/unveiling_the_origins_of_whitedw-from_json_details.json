        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Unveiling the Origins of White-Dwarf Explosions\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms behind white-dwarf explosions is critical for comprehending heavy element nucleosynthesis, galaxy feedback mechanisms, and the evolution of binary systems. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as cosmological-distance indicators and were instrumental in the discovery of the accelerating Universe. However, recent high-cadence surveys and theoretical advances suggest the existence of alternative explosion channels for white dwarfs, such as disruption by intermediate-mass black holes, mergers with neutron stars, and collisions within triple systems.\n\nThe proposed project aims to conduct a complete census of white-dwarf explosion methods, map observations to their underlying explosion physics, and constrain the diversity of these catastrophic events. Our approach leverages the largest sample of rapidly discovered and spectroscopically confirmed white-dwarf transients, coupled with detailed follow-up observations. We intend to apply advanced machine-learning techniques and neural-network emulators for rapid model comparisons, to understand the explosion model diversity in different galaxy environments. \n\nThis project's significance lies in its potential to define optimal samples of SNe Ia for cosmological studies and determine the rates and contributions of white-dwarf explosions to the origins of elements. The implications of our work extend to nucleosynthetic yields, enhancing the cosmological utility of white-dwarf explosions, and predicting gravitational-wave detection rates, which could inform future missions like LISA.\n\nWith insights into the various explosion mechanisms of white dwarfs, this project will provide crucial data for cosmic processes and their potential use in cosmological studies, setting the stage for a new era of understanding white-dwarf phenomena and their impact on the Universe."

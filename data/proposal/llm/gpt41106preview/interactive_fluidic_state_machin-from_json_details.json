        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"Interactive Fluidic State Machines for Soft Robotics\" (ILUMIS), an innovative project poised to revolutionize the field of soft robotics. Inspired by the fluidity and adaptability of natural organisms, ILUMIS aims to overcome the current limitations of functional localization in soft robotics by integrating actuation, energy storage, sensing, and logic into a cohesive, compliant system. The proposed project will leverage a novel fluidic network architecture composed of nonlinear elements, enabling the development of embodied functionalities such as logic, actuation, sensing, and energy within the material structure itself.\n\nILUMIS addresses the challenge of inverse design optimization to create an interactive fluidic state machine that mimics the inherent capabilities of biological systems. By decentralizing the functionalities traditionally found in rigid components, this approach allows for a more versatile and resilient robotic platform. The project's objectives include the development of soft robots with an unprecedented level of embodied functionality, allowing for more efficient, autonomous operation in complex environments.\n\nPotential applications of ILUMIS are vast and impactful, including the creation of surgical micro-robots capable of delicate and precise interventions, exploration robots that can navigate and adapt to unpredictable terrains, and haptic interfaces for virtual reality that offer more natural and intuitive user experiences. The anticipated outcome of this project is to establish a new blueprint for soft robotic design, bridging the gap between artificial systems and the sophisticated mechanisms found in nature. The successful realization of ILUMIS will not only advance the state-of-the-art in soft robotics but will also have transformative implications for medical technology, exploration equipment, and interactive devices."

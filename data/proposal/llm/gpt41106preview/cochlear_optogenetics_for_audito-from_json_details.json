        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'Cochlear Optogenetics for Auditory Research and Prosthetics' project, herein referred to as OptoHear, is an innovative initiative designed to address the challenges faced by the 360 million individuals worldwide with sensorineural hearing impairment (HI). The current standard of care, cochlear implants (CIs) employing electric stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), is limited by a low quality of 'electric hearing' and poor frequency resolution. OptoHear aims to revolutionize auditory prosthetics and research by increasing the number of independent coding channels through spatially confined optical stimulation of the cochlea.\n\nBuilding on our proof-of-principle achievements, which include virus-mediated expression of channelrhodopsins (ChRs) in SGNs, recording light-evoked auditory activity, and demonstrating superior frequency resolution with optical stimulation as compared to electrical in rodent models, we propose to further optimize the expression of the most effective ChRs. Our innovative approach has already led to the co-development and implantation of optical multichannel CIs, whose positions have been precisely studied using X-ray tomography.\n\nIn the next phase, OptoHear will focus on optimizing ChR expression in SGNs, establishing multichannel optical stimulation paradigms, and characterizing neuronal responses to cochlear optogenetics through a combination of physiological and behavioural approaches. As a research tool, cochlear optogenetics will open new avenues for fundamental auditory research, enhancing our understanding of hearing mechanisms and disorders.\n\nUltimately, OptoHear is dedicated to preparing cochlear optogenetics for clinical translation, with the potential to substantially improve speech comprehension and overall hearing quality for individuals with sensorineural HI. Through meticulous development and validation, OptoHear strives to deliver a groundbreaking alternative to current auditory prosthetics, poised to significantly enhance the quality of life for millions affected by hearing loss."

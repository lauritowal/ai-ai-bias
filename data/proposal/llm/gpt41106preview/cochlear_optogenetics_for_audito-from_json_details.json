        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Cochlear Optogenetics for Auditory Research and Prosthetics\n\nSensorineural hearing impairment (HI) affects approximately 360 million individuals worldwide, with its prevalence increasing with age. Current treatments, primarily cochlear implants (CIs) that use electric stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), provide speech comprehension but suffer from low auditory quality and poor frequency resolution. The project \"Cochlear Optogenetics for Auditory Research and Prosthetics,\" also known as OptoHear, proposes a novel approach to overcome these limitations by employing optogenetic stimulation of the cochlea to increase the number of independent coding channels for auditory signals.\n\nOptoHear aims to leverage spatially confined optical stimulation of the cochlea to precisely target SGNs expressing channelrhodopsins (ChRs). Preliminary proof of principle has been demonstrated through virus-mediated expression of ChR in SGNs, recording light-evoked auditory activity, and showing improved frequency resolution in optical versus electric stimulation in rodent models. Advances include the co-development and implantation of optical multichannel CIs and the assessment of implant positioning using X-ray tomography.\n\nThe project outlines a comprehensive plan to optimize the expression of the most suitable ChRs in SGNs and to establish multichannel optical stimulation protocols. Additionally, it will characterize the physiological and behavioral neuronal responses to cochlear optogenetics along the auditory pathway. The ultimate goal of OptoHear is to validate cochlear optogenetics as a powerful research tool for fundamental auditory research and hearing restoration, and to lay the groundwork for clinical translation.\n\nBy increasing the fidelity of auditory signal processing, OptoHear has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for those with sensorineural HI, particularly as the global population ages. This grant proposal seeks support to advance this innovative technology from proof-of-concept achievements to practical applications, with the long-term goal of clinical adoption for improved auditory prosthetics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Cochlear Optogenetics for Auditory Research and Prosthetics\n\nWith an estimated 360 million individuals affected worldwide, sensorineural hearing impairment (HI) represents a significant global health challenge. The current standard of care involves electric stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) using cochlear implants (CIs), which, while enabling speech comprehension for many users, is limited by the low quality of \"electric hearing\" and poor frequency resolution, compromising the richness of auditory perception.\n\nThe proposed project, OptoHear, aims to revolutionize auditory research and prosthetics by employing optogenetic stimulation of the cochlea to increase the number of independent coding channels. This technique utilizes virus-mediated expression of channelrhodopsins (ChRs) in SGNs, enabling spatially confined optical stimulation, which has demonstrated improved frequency resolution over electric stimulation in rodent models.\n\nSignificant progress has been achieved through the development of optical multichannel CIs and the analysis of implant positioning using X-ray tomography. The future work encompasses optimizing the expression of the most suitable ChRs in SGNs, establishing multichannel optical stimulation protocols, and characterizing neuronal responses to cochlear optogenetics through physiological and behavioural approaches.\n\nOptoHear will also explore the application of cochlear optogenetics as a research tool to understand fundamental auditory processes and advance hearing restoration techniques. The ultimate goal of the project is to prepare for clinical translation, with the potential to vastly improve auditory outcomes for millions of individuals with sensorineural HI. This grant proposal seeks to validate the promise of cochlear optogenetics and to lay the groundwork for its adoption in both research settings and clinical practice.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Cochlear Optogenetics for Auditory Research and Prosthetics\" (OptoHear) aims to revolutionize the field of auditory prosthetics and fundamental research on hearing. Sensorineural hearing impairment (HI) affects an estimated 360 million individuals globally, and its prevalence increases with age. Current cochlear implant (CI) technology relies on electric stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which has inherent limitations, including low quality of hearing and poor frequency resolution, impacting the effectiveness of speech comprehension.\n\nOptoHear proposes a novel approach utilizing optogenetic stimulation of the cochlea to overcome these limitations. The project seeks to increase the number of independent coding channels through spatially confined optical stimulation of ChR-expressing SGNs. Our proof of principle has demonstrated virus-mediated expression of channelrhodopsins (ChRs) in SGNs, the recording of light-evoked auditory activity, and improved frequency resolution in optical versus electric stimulation in rodent models.\n\nThe grant will support the development of optical multichannel CIs and the optimization of ChR expression in SGNs, with the goal of establishing multichannel optical stimulation. The project will also involve a thorough characterization of neuronal responses to cochlear optogenetics along the auditory pathway using both physiological and behavioral approaches.\n\nBy leveraging cochlear optogenetics as a research tool, OptoHear will validate the potential of this technology for both fundamental auditory research and hearing restoration. The project is committed to preparing for clinical translation, with the long-term goal of providing a superior alternative to current CI technology for individuals with sensorineural HI. This innovative research holds the promise of drastically improving the quality of life for millions of people with hearing impairments.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'Cochlear Optogenetics for Auditory Research and Prosthetics' project, herein referred to as OptoHear, is an innovative initiative designed to address the challenges faced by the 360 million individuals worldwide with sensorineural hearing impairment (HI). The current standard of care, cochlear implants (CIs) employing electric stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), is limited by a low quality of 'electric hearing' and poor frequency resolution. OptoHear aims to revolutionize auditory prosthetics and research by increasing the number of independent coding channels through spatially confined optical stimulation of the cochlea.\n\nBuilding on our proof-of-principle achievements, which include virus-mediated expression of channelrhodopsins (ChRs) in SGNs, recording light-evoked auditory activity, and demonstrating superior frequency resolution with optical stimulation as compared to electrical in rodent models, we propose to further optimize the expression of the most effective ChRs. Our innovative approach has already led to the co-development and implantation of optical multichannel CIs, whose positions have been precisely studied using X-ray tomography.\n\nIn the next phase, OptoHear will focus on optimizing ChR expression in SGNs, establishing multichannel optical stimulation paradigms, and characterizing neuronal responses to cochlear optogenetics through a combination of physiological and behavioural approaches. As a research tool, cochlear optogenetics will open new avenues for fundamental auditory research, enhancing our understanding of hearing mechanisms and disorders.\n\nUltimately, OptoHear is dedicated to preparing cochlear optogenetics for clinical translation, with the potential to substantially improve speech comprehension and overall hearing quality for individuals with sensorineural HI. Through meticulous development and validation, OptoHear strives to deliver a groundbreaking alternative to current auditory prosthetics, poised to significantly enhance the quality of life for millions affected by hearing loss."

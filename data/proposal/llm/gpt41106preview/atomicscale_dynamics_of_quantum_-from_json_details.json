        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Atomic-Scale Dynamics of Quantum Materials\" project represents a groundbreaking effort to explore the atomic-level behavior of quantum materials, substances that exhibit extraordinary properties such as high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance. In the field of condensed matter physics, these materials promise a revolution in the way we understand and manipulate the electronic states in correlated-electron systems. The core objective of this research is to elucidate the microscopic dynamics at play within quantum materials characterized by atomic scale heterogeneity and to understand how these dynamics influence macroscopic phenomena.\n\nEmploying advanced techniques such as ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy at terahertz (THz) wavelengths and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), the project aims to achieve atomic spatial resolution and picosecond time resolution. These tools will be enhanced with strong THz radiation in the STM tunnel junction to control charge order locally through tip interaction, atom manipulation, and coherent driving with THz fields. The spectroscopy goals are ambitiously set to quantify nanometer-sized variations in quasiparticle lifetimes and to capture the microscopic mechanisms of charge density wave pinning.\n\nThe project's impact will be multifaceted, addressing challenges in correlated-electron materials and aiming to resolve the interplay between cooper pairing and charge orderâ€”a competition that is pivotal in understanding superconductivity. Expected outcomes include the creation of new experiments that interact with many-body phases at the intrinsic length scale of charge correlation, identification of opportunities for scaling of electronic devices, and potential contributions to improved information handling and energy harvesting.\n\nIn summary, the dasQ proposal is set to provide fundamental insights into the atomic-scale dynamics of quantum materials, which could herald a new generation of devices and advanced applications in technology and materials science."

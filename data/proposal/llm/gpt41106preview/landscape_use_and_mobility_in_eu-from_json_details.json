        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Landscape Use and Mobility In EuRopE - Bridging the gap between cremation and inhumation\" aims to enhance our understanding of historical human mobility in Europe by addressing the challenges posed by the loss of information from the practice of cremation, which reaches temperatures up to 1000°C. The primary goal is to develop innovative proxies for analyzing calcined bone, which is created at temperatures above 650°C, and to re-evaluate the potential of charred bone remains. By creating robust baselines for analysis, this project will significantly increase the quantity and quality of information retrieved from cremated remains, enabling the inclusion of a larger number of individuals and improving the documentation of human mobility from the Neolithic to the Early Medieval Period.\n\nThe project will utilize state-of-the-art biogeochemical studies on bone and teeth to document past human movement and characterize turnover rates for different skeletal elements. Advanced statistical and spatial models will be employed to integrate data from local, regional, and European scales, combining new findings with previously published results. This methodology will allow for a comprehensive understanding of landscape use and mobility patterns during key historical periods where both cremation and inhumation funerary practices were prevalent.\n\nBy overcoming the challenges of information destruction during cremation and the differing bioarchaeological information from burned and unburned remains, the project will create a new paradigm for interpreting mobility in past populations. The expected outcomes include an increased number of analyzed individuals through the inclusion of charred bones and better characterization of skeletal turnover rates, providing a richer and more nuanced narrative of human history in Europe."

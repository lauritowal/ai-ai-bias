        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces the GR-GATE project, aimed at pioneering the development of Scalable Graphene-Gated Transistors utilizing the advanced negative quantum capacitance field effect transistor (NQCFET) technology. The project's breakthrough lies in the strategic integration of a graphene layer within the gate of traditional MOSFET transistors, which induces negative quantum capacitance (NQC) due to electron-correlation effects. This innovation is poised to revolutionize transistor operation by enabling steep subthreshold characteristics and efficient low power supply voltage (Vdd) operation.\n\nThe GR-GATE project aligns with the scaling trends and technological demands of the current semiconductor industry, promising compatibility with established Si device architectures, such as Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator (FDSOI) and Tunneling Field Effect Transistor (TFET) technologies. The project aspires to significantly enhance low power and high-performance operation characteristics of transistors, positioning itself as a competitive force against emerging steep slope switch technologies.\n\nGR-GATE's non-disruptive innovation is designed to complement mainstream Si devices, ensuring a fast and smooth transition to large volume production. With a current prototype at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4, the project targets the development of scalable prototype transistor arrays. The objectives include achieving acceptable device yield, reduced gate lengths, and lower gate dielectric thickness on larger area wafers.\n\nThe projectâ€™s commercialization strategy is fortified with the aim to secure Intellectual Property (IP) through international patent filing and a robust valorisation process to assess manufacturability and viability. Collaboration with leading European technology development laboratories and the pursuit of licensing agreements with key chip manufacturers underscore the project's commitment to industrial integration.\n\nUltimately, GR-GATE is projected to reach TRL 8-9, demonstrating an advanced development stage that ensures high commercial value and a substantial impact on the field of energy-efficient nanoelectronics. The project's success promises to enable volume production, fostering a new era of innovative, energy-saving electronic devices."

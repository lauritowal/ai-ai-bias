        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Investigating Mammalian Evolution Using Million-Year Genomic Transects\" project, hosted by the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, aims to revolutionize the field of ancient DNA research by extending the study of evolutionary biology and palaeontology beyond the current limit of the last 50,000 years. This groundbreaking endeavor proposes to study evolution on a million-year timescale, focusing on the Early and Middle Pleistocene epoch, a period critical to understanding the forces shaping modern biodiversity.\n\nThe primary objectives of the project are to develop and apply innovative palaeogenomic methods to extend the limits of DNA recovery and to sequence one hundred ancient genomes from multiple Holarctic mammalian species. The project will examine macroevolutionary changes, investigate speciation events, and assess the demographic consequences of Pleistocene climate change on mammalian populations. Key scientific questions will address the origin of species, the role of interspecific introgression, the timing and rate of adaptive evolution, and the impact of environmental changes on species demographics.\n\nOur research group is at the cutting edge of wildlife palaeogenomics, having recently achieved a significant breakthrough by extending ancient DNA recovery to beyond one million years. This expertise positions us uniquely to undertake this ambitious project. The proposed work will set a new paradigm for palaeogenomic research by providing an unparalleled resource for investigating long-term evolutionary dynamics and responses to environmental changes.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes include not only extending the current state of the art in ancient DNA studies but also creating a valuable resource for future research into the evolutionary history of mammalian species. Through this project, we aim to unlock a deeper understanding of mammalian evolution and provide insights relevant to conservation biology, evolutionary theory, and our comprehension of Earth's past climates and ecosystems.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Investigating Mammalian Evolution Using Million-Year Genomic Transects\n\nThe Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm is poised to revolutionize our understanding of mammalian evolution through the ambitious project \"Investigating Mammalian Evolution Using Million-Year Genomic Transects.\" Building upon our recent accomplishment of extending ancient DNA recovery beyond the previous limit of 50,000 years to over one million years, we aim to set a new paradigm in the field of ancient DNA by studying evolution on a million-year timescale.\n\nThis innovative research seeks to sequence one hundred ancient genomes from multiple Holarctic mammalian species whose remains date from the Early to Middle Pleistocene, a period that includes significant Pleistocene climate change and speciation events. By examining macroevolutionary changes and investigating the demographic consequences of past environmental changes, we aim to provide insights into species origination, the importance of interspecific introgression, and the timing and rate of adaptive evolution.\n\nOur research group, which is at the cutting edge of wildlife palaeogenomics, will develop and apply novel palaeogenomic methods to extend the current limits of DNA recovery. This groundbreaking work has the potential to contribute significantly to both evolutionary biology and palaeontology, offering an unparalleled resource for researchers studying long-term evolutionary dynamics and the effects of environmental changes.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the establishment of a resource for future research into evolutionary processes and environmental adaptations, as well as the advancement of our understanding of mammalian evolution. With its potential to extend beyond the current state of the art, this project promises to evolve the discipline of palaeogenomics and provide a wealth of knowledge about our planet's biological history.\n\nFunding this proposal will enable us to leverage our team's expertise and recent technological breakthroughs to explore unanswered scientific questions that have been beyond our reach until now, thereby enhancing our comprehension of life's complex history on Earth.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Investigating mammalian evolution using million-year genomic transects\n\nThe Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm proposes a transformative project that will revolutionize the field of ancient DNA research and significantly contribute to evolutionary biology and palaeontology. Historically, the study of ancient DNA has been confined to the last 50,000 years. However, our research group, currently at the forefront of wildlife palaeogenomics, has made a recent breakthrough by extending the limit of ancient DNA recovery to beyond one million years. Building upon this achievement, our project aims to study mammalian evolution on an unprecedented million-year timescale.\n\nThe project's core objectives include developing novel palaeogenomic methods to further extend DNA recovery limits, sequencing one hundred ancient genomes from Early and Middle Pleistocene remains, and examining macroevolutionary changes across multiple Holarctic mammalian species. We will investigate speciation events, assess the importance of interspecific introgression, and determine the timing and rate of adaptive evolution, all while illuminating the demographic consequences of Pleistocene climate changes.\n\nOur research questions are centered on understanding species origination, the significance of interspecific introgression, the pace of adaptive evolution, and how past environmental changes shaped current biodiversity. We expect to set a new paradigm in palaeogenomic research by providing an unparalleled resource that will offer insights into long-term evolutionary dynamics and the effects of environmental changes.\n\nThis project represents a leap beyond the current state of the art, promising to extend our knowledge of ancient DNA and serve as a critical resource for future research. With our team's proven experience and the innovative methods we propose, we anticipate that the outcomes of this project will have a profound impact on our understanding of mammalian evolution and the forces that have shaped the biodiversity we see today.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Investigating mammalian evolution using million-year genomic transects\" spearheaded by the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, aims to revolutionize our understanding of mammalian evolution by extending the study of ancient DNA (aDNA) beyond the current limit of 50,000 years to a million-year timeframe. Positioned at the cutting-edge of wildlife palaeogenomics, this groundbreaking research seeks to answer fundamental questions relating to species origination, the significance of interspecific introgression, the timing and rate of adaptive evolution, and the demographic consequences of past environmental changes.\n\nOur project targets the sequencing of one hundred ancient genomes from multiple Holarctic mammalian species, focusing on remains from the Early and Middle Pleistocene epochs. By examining macroevolutionary changes and speciation events, specifically during periods marked by Pleistocene climate change, we will develop and apply novel palaeogenomic methods to push the boundaries of DNA recovery limits.\n\nThe research team, recognized for leading wildlife palaeogenomics studies and recently achieving the significant milestone of extending aDNA recovery beyond one million years, is uniquely positioned to undertake this ambitious project. Our research will set a new paradigm for palaeogenomic studies, moving well beyond the state of the art and providing an unparalleled resource for the study of long-term evolutionary dynamics and environmental changes.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include not only a comprehensive understanding of mammalian evolutionary biology and palaeontology but also the establishment of a resource for the broader scientific community interested in evolutionary dynamics and the impact of environmental factors on species evolution. Through this initiative, we aim to transform the landscape of palaeogenomic research and contribute valuable insights into the intricate processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth."

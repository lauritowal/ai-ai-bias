        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Investigating mammalian evolution using million-year genomic transects\" spearheaded by the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, aims to revolutionize our understanding of mammalian evolution by extending the study of ancient DNA (aDNA) beyond the current limit of 50,000 years to a million-year timeframe. Positioned at the cutting-edge of wildlife palaeogenomics, this groundbreaking research seeks to answer fundamental questions relating to species origination, the significance of interspecific introgression, the timing and rate of adaptive evolution, and the demographic consequences of past environmental changes.\n\nOur project targets the sequencing of one hundred ancient genomes from multiple Holarctic mammalian species, focusing on remains from the Early and Middle Pleistocene epochs. By examining macroevolutionary changes and speciation events, specifically during periods marked by Pleistocene climate change, we will develop and apply novel palaeogenomic methods to push the boundaries of DNA recovery limits.\n\nThe research team, recognized for leading wildlife palaeogenomics studies and recently achieving the significant milestone of extending aDNA recovery beyond one million years, is uniquely positioned to undertake this ambitious project. Our research will set a new paradigm for palaeogenomic studies, moving well beyond the state of the art and providing an unparalleled resource for the study of long-term evolutionary dynamics and environmental changes.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include not only a comprehensive understanding of mammalian evolutionary biology and palaeontology but also the establishment of a resource for the broader scientific community interested in evolutionary dynamics and the impact of environmental factors on species evolution. Through this initiative, we aim to transform the landscape of palaeogenomic research and contribute valuable insights into the intricate processes that have shaped the diversity of life on Earth."

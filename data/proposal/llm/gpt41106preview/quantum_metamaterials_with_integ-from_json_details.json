        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces an innovative project titled \"Quantum Metamaterials with integrated atomic-like arrays for quantum information processing.\" The project's overarching goal is to revolutionize quantum information processing by realizing quantum systems that can effectively generate and manipulate entanglement among numerous qubits. These systems will address the current challenges in quantum information technology, including the distribution of entanglement and the efficient interaction between localized qubits (atoms) and flying qubits (photons).\n\nThe core approach involves the creation of quantum metamaterials, constructed from precisely engineered arrays of quantum emitters, specifically silicon-vacancy centers, embedded within a diamond chip. This bottom-up building strategy aims to yield an enhanced collective response to light, providing a platform for the coherent control of the emitters' internal degrees of freedom and access to long-lived states essential for quantum memory.\n\nThe vision of this project is to develop a scalable quantum light source capable of producing large-scale atom-photon entanglement. This will be achieved through the implementation of novel quantum information protocols designed to generate many-body entangled states, facilitating one-way quantum computation. The anticipated system advantages include high-fidelity quantum control over photonic states, a potential operation-time speed-up through parallel photon control, and seamless integration into existing nanophotonic frameworks.\n\nBy overcoming the limitations posed by interaction strength and loss mechanisms, the proposed quantum metamaterials will serve as a transformative interface for quantum applications, uniting major advantages for scaling-up entanglement. This project aims to propel the community's focus towards enhanced light-matter interactions, paving the way for more efficient and scalable quantum operations."

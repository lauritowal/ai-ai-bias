        "Abstract:\n\nThe project 'Food Circuits: Hidden Connections between Migrants and Societies' aims to illuminate the intricate, often invisible socio-economic relationships that are established through the global movement and consumption of food. By focusing on three specific food items—German asparagus, Spanish oranges, and Californian strawberries—the proposal seeks to shed light on the embodied experiences of migrant farm labourers, supply chain workers, and consumers that are deeply intertwined within the food circuits.\n\nThis multifaceted study will delve into the labour involved in producing and transporting food, as well as the process of consumption and how food is incorporated into individual and collective identities. Migrant labourers, who are indispensable yet often deemed disposable and at times prohibited, and supply chain workers, increasingly migrants themselves under tight delivery constraints, represent a human landscape behind the foods we eat. Consumers, on the other hand, engage with these foods for survival, enjoyment, identity, and ethical considerations, revealing a complex set of intentions that go beyond mere sustenance.\n\nThe project has three core objectives: to develop a theoretical framework capturing the connections between migrants and societies; to reconceptualize the invisibilization of these indirect connections through food infrastructures and processes; and to expand research methods and ethics in field research through collaborative approaches. It offers a novel perspective on the social and embodied connections between migrants and societies, challenging conventional narratives and uncovering the layers of human involvement from farm to table.\n\nThe expected contributions of this research are significant, as it will not only enhance theoretical understandings but also inform policy-making and social awareness regarding the critical roles that migrants play in our daily sustenance. The project promises to transform the way we perceive and value the labor and lives that sustain the global food system."

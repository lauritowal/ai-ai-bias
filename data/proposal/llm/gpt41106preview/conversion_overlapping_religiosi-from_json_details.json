        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Conversion, Overlapping Religiosities, Polemics, Interaction: Early Modern Iberia and Beyond,\" seeks to dissect the intricate web of religious interplay and dynamics in sixteenth-century Iberia, a period marked by profound religious transformations. The principal investigator, Martín de Figuerola, a convert from Islam, aims to explore the nuanced interactions among Muslims of Valencia and Aragon, social actors, and scholars during a time of turbulent religious change, including the expulsion of Jews, forced conversions, and the later expulsion of Muslims who had converted to Christianity.\n\nThe proposed project will analyze how cross-currents among different religious groups led to the emergence of local overlapping religiosities and the development of vague or hybrid religious identities. It will also examine the determined efforts by various social actors and scholars to establish clear religious ascriptions and categorizations. By focusing on case studies such as the anecdote from Cocentaina regarding Muslim marriage contract customs, the project will offer a microcosmic view of broader regional practices and beliefs.\n\nThe research methodology includes comprehensive archival research, meticulous analysis of Inquisition trials, and an examination of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, including new translations of the Qur’an, Jewish and Islamic classics, and polemical literature. These materials will provide a multifaceted perspective on the adversarial relationships and dependencies that defined the period's religious landscape.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of the research is to enhance our understanding of the complexity of religious identities during a pivotal moment in Iberian history. By unveiling the layers of religious interaction and polemics, this project will contribute significantly to historical scholarship on early modern Europe and the enduring legacies of religious conversion, conflict, and coexistence.\n\nKeywords: Iberia, sixteenth-century, religious conversion, overlapping religiosities, Inquisition, archival research, Martín de Figuerola."

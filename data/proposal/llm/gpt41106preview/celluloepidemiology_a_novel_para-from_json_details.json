        "Abstract:\n\nThe CELLULO-EPI project, spearheaded by a collaboration between a paediatric immunologist and a physicist with expertise in mathematical disease modeling, proposes to introduce 'Celluloepidemiology'â€”a groundbreaking concept that integrates cellular immune responses with population-level mathematical modeling. The project aims to revolutionize the understanding of T-cell dynamics by generating comprehensive T-cell profiles that reflect individuals' immunological history and response to pathogens.\n\nTo achieve this, CELLULO-EPI will create an innovative model simulating T-cell evolution in response to infectious diseases within a synthetic population. Key variables incorporated into the model include age, gender, time since infection, and other pertinent factors. The model will be parametrized and validated using a robust dataset, which includes cross-sectional T-cell data from 500 participants, alongside cases with known first infections of dengue and measles, and longitudinal data of re-exposure to chickenpox and parvovirus B19. A follow-up will re-sample the initial cohort after a year to refine the model's predictive capacity.\n\nThis proposal's public health implications are profound. CELLULO-EPI has the potential to address the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination dilemma by allowing us to back-calculate the time since last exposure to a pathogen, thereby reshaping current approaches to infectious disease epidemiology. The anticipated outcomes include improved vaccination strategies, enhanced disease surveillance, and a deeper understanding of population immunity. By merging immunological insights with epidemiological patterns, CELLULO-EPI will provide critical information that could substantially inform public health decisions and strategies, making it a highly innovative and valuable contribution to the field of infectious disease research."

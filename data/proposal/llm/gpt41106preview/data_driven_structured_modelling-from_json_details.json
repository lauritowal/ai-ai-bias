        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Data Driven Structured Modelling of Nonlinear Dynamic Systems,\" aims to revolutionize the field of system identification by developing a novel framework for constructing high-quality, cost-effective nonlinear models. The demand for models that can accurately represent complex nonlinear dynamics is imperative across various sectors, including industrial, biomechanical, and biomedical applications. However, the quality of these models and the costs associated with building them are currently significant limiting factors.\n\nThis research plans to address these challenges by introducing a new nonlinear structured system identification framework that operates on two main fronts. Firstly, we will develop data-driven methods that reveal the structure of unstructured nonlinear state-space models. Secondly, we will identify complex block-oriented models starting from the best linear approximations of nonlinear systems.\n\nThe strategy involves a synergistic approach combining top-down and bottom-up methodologies. In the top-down approach, we will reveal the underlying structures of nonlinear models from unstructured initial representations. In contrast, the bottom-up strategy will identify critical components of the system, culminating in a comprehensive model that reflects the nonlinear dynamics accurately. Additionally, a new experiment design strategy will be developed to retrieve the best models with the least experimental cost, thereby optimizing the modelling process.\n\nThe project is rooted in the long-standing experience of the Principal Investigator (PI) in frequency domain system identification with nonlinear distortions, with recent work demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed methods. The theoretical contribution will include the development of a new structured identification framework, while the practical contribution will offer a new modelling paradigm to enhance system and control design. This project presents a significant challenge for the system identification community, poised to extend beyond current capabilities and offering potent solutions to the demands for higher performance and efficiency in nonlinear dynamic systems."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Micro-Scale Photonic Trace Gas Sensor\" project represents a transformative leap in gas-sensing technology, promising to deliver part-per-billion (ppb) sensitivity and selectivity on a micro-scale form factor. This advancement is crucial for environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and healthcare, where current high-end sensors are limited by their bulky size, high cost, and confinement to research settings.\n\nBuilding on the exceptional groundwork laid by the ERC Starting Grant sCENT project, which yielded the first chip-scale sensor with ppb-level detection, our proposal aims to push these capabilities further into a prototype module suitable for real-life applications. The proposed sensor boasts a pioneering waveguide design supporting air-like modes, ensuring high sensitivity and selectivity, along with isotope detection capabilities and long-term stability. Its compact, lightweight nature, requiring only microlitre sample volumes, sets the stage for large-scale deployment.\n\nThe project's immediate goal is to demonstrate the sensor's utility in studying metabolic emissions from methane-consuming bacteria in permafrost soils, a significant step towards understanding and mitigating climate change impacts. This sensor, thus, has the potential to become a cornerstone in environmental intelligence.\n\nTo realize this vision, our proposal includes plans for IP protection, market analysis, and a technology roadmap designed to guide the sensor from prototype to commercial product. Outreach activities will focus on engaging commercial partners, end-users, and stakeholders to foster relationships crucial for the sensor's success in the targeted markets.\n\nIn summary, the proposed \"Micro-Scale Photonic Trace Gas Sensor\" project is an ambitious effort to unlock opportunities for large-scale, in-situ gas monitoring with unparalleled data density, significantly impacting environmental intelligence and beyond."

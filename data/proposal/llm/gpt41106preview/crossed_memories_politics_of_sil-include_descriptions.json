        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the CROME project which seeks to produce pioneering insights into the memories and silences surrounding the colonial-liberation wars fought between the Portuguese state and African independence movements from 1961 to 1974/75. The project adopts a diachronic and comparative methodology to explore the evolution and contrast of war memories, colonial pasts, and anticolonial legacies in the social consciousness of Portugal and its former African colonies: Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Principe.\n\nThe central hypothesis posits that these wars, as climactic events concluding Portuguese imperial rule and initiating African independence, instigated specific processes of memorialization and silence with their own historic trajectories. CROME is structured into two investigative strands. The first, ‘Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States,’ examines the state's role in shaping public memory and historical narratives, as well as its involvement in perpetuating selective historical representations. The second, ‘Memory as a Battlefield,’ focuses on the interplay between collective and individual recollections, elucidating varied invocations of the past and the dynamics of social memory.\n\nCROME's objective is to reveal the multiplicity of memories and divergent historical interpretations that emerged from the wars, principally in Portugal, and to investigate the distinct postcolonial histories of each African nation in terms of their unique engagements with war memories and colonial legacies. The project aims to offer a novel perspective in colonial-liberation war studies and provide a foundation for addressing the enduring trauma associated with these conflicts. Through its comparative analysis, CROME aspires to facilitate overcoming the lingering obstacles imposed by the legacy of European colonialism."

The project’s main challenge is to produce innovative knowledge about the memories of the wars fought by the Portuguese state and pro-independence African movements between 1961 and 1974/5. The approach chosen is simultaneously diachronic and comparative, inasmuch as it contrasts changes that took place between the end of the conflicts and nowadays, regarding how wars, colonial pasts and anticolonial legacies have been remembered and silenced in Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and São Tomé and Principe. The key hypothesis is that wars - as pivotal moments that ended the cycle of Empire in Portugal and started the cycle of African independences in the former Portuguese colonies - triggered memorialisation and silencing processes which had their own historicity. CROME is divided into two strands. The first one, named ‘Colonial Wars, Postcolonial States’, looks at the role played by the states under consideration in mobilising, articulating and recognising the past, but also in actively generating selective representations. ‘Memory as a battlefield’ is the second strand, which will highlight distinct uses of the past and dynamics between social memories and individual memories. The project intends to demonstrate how wars gave rise to multiple memories and conflicting historical judgements, mostly in Portugal, but also to examine how the specific nature of the (post-)colonial histories of each African country has generated different ways to summon war memories and (anti-)colonial legacies. CROME will, thus, put forward a ground-breaking perspective in terms of colonial-liberation war studies, and will be instrumental in dealing with such traumatic experience, for its comparative approach might help overcoming everlasting constraints still at play today, caused by the historical burden European colonialism left behind.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal entitled \"Multidisciplinary Studies of Extreme and Rogue Wave Phenomena\" (MULTIWAVE) represents a groundbreaking effort to address some of the most pressing questions in the fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering concerning nonlinear wave propagation and the emergence of extreme wave events. With objectives centered on the exploration of open questions in nonlinear wave dynamics and the study of the formation of rogue waves, MULTIWAVE proposes a robust Co-Investigator approach that integrates analytical studies, numerical simulations, and innovative laboratory experiments.\n\nBuilding on recent international developments led by our team, MULTIWAVE draws on analogies between optical systems and deep ocean wave dynamics. This interdisciplinary project leverages the first experimental validation in 2010 of analytic predictions that had remained untested for 25 years, marking a significant achievement in the understanding of hydrodynamics.\n\nThe theoretical elements of the project aim to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that allow for the emergence of large-scale coherent structures from turbulent environments and to resolve the basic questions of energy transport in systems characterized by nonlinearity. The technological cornerstone of MULTIWAVE is the development of an 'optical wave tank', which will simulate hydrodynamic and ocean system behaviors and allow for the study of the dynamics and statistics of extreme nonlinear wave shaping.\n\nThe focus on extreme rogue wave events, which are natural phenomena of great consequence in oceanic environments, positions the MULTIWAVE project at the forefront of scientific and technological advancement. By employing historical comparisons, such as the introduction of optical systems to study chaos in the 1970s, the project will offer new perspectives and possibilities in the study of complex wave phenomena.\n\nOverall, MULTIWAVE promises to deliver significant contributions to our theoretical and practical understandings of rogue waves, with broad implications for the prediction and mitigation of these potentially devastating natural events."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Are Marine Living Microorganisms Influencing Clouds?\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to explore a relatively under-investigated aspect of atmospheric science: the role of marine living microorganisms in cloud formation and precipitation processes. Despite the Earth's oceans covering 70% of its surface, the extent to which biological processes in seawater contribute to aerosol formation and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) remains debated. Recent findings suggest that nucleation, a key process in aerosol formation, may be biologically driven by emissions from seawater, particularly through the nucleation of low-volatility gas-phase compounds and the production of primary particles via bubble bursting.\n\nThe main goal of this study is to investigate how marine emissions from living microorganisms influence CCN, IN, and ultimately the properties of clouds. This will be achieved through a multi-pronged approach involving field mesocosms that encapsulate the air-sea interface, linking marine emissions to the biogeochemical properties of natural seawater, and conducting ambient aerosol measurements at low and high-altitude sites across the Southern Hemisphere. The project will also incorporate modeling studies to merge process investigations with ambient measurements and assess the role of biologically driven marine emissions on cloud properties.\n\nThrough this research, we aim to quantify marine primary bioaerosol emissions and evaluate their impact on IN and cloud precipitation capabilities. Understanding the biological contributions to cloud formation is critical for improving climate models and predicting future climate scenarios. This project promises to deliver significant insights into the Earth's climate system, highlighting the interconnectedness of the ocean's biological activity with the atmosphere and climate regulation."

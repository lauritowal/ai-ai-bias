        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to pioneer a revolutionary comparative method in the study of historical classification of species and populations through the lens of molecular biology and the evolution of cultural traits, particularly languages. Building on the hypothesis of Sokal and Cavalli Sforza, which suggested a correlation between language families and classical genetic markers, this project aims to refine and advance the methodological precision of language classification. Acknowledging the limitations of existing lexical-focused approaches, such as the classical method and Greenberg’s mass comparison, our research will employ a novel grammatical evidence-based comparative method, as proposed by Longobardi and Guardiano. This innovative technique, grounded in the latest theoretical frameworks of formal and typological linguistics, offers an unprecedented level of testability and replicability, capable of measuring linguistic distances even among distantly related populations. The collaborative effort will involve linguists and biologists working together to meticulously select populations for comprehensive language and gene sampling. The project will integrate cutting-edge genetic tools, including genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, Y chromosome, and mitochondrial DNA markers, along with sophisticated biostatistical methods, to delineate DNA diversity and its correlation with linguistic divergence. The expected outcome is a significant enhancement in the accuracy of long-range taxonomies, bridging the gap between biological evolution and the transmission of languages, and fulfilling Darwin's anticipation of a concordance between phylogenetic trees of humans and their languages."

Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et. al. (1988, 1994) advocated a correspondence between some proposed language families and classical genetic markers, i.e. between biological evolution and transmission of cultural traits (languages), in agreement with Darwin’s (1859) prediction of an eventual isomorphy between trees of languages and populations. Their conclusions were variously criticised, and are especially undermined by the weakness of available language classification methods, mainly based on lexical (in a broad sense) material: these are either too narrow in scope (classical method) or probabilistically unreliable (Greenberg’s mass comparison) to provide solid long-range taxonomies to be matched against those of geneticists. We will address such issues with a radically new comparative method (Longobardi and Guardiano 2009) based entirely on grammatical evidence and on recent theoretical advances in formal and typological linguistics. The method ensures unprecedented standards of testability/replicability and can measure linguistic distances between even remote populations. Linguists and biologists will for the first time jointly select the populations most significant from either perspective for language/gene sampling. We will also adopt the newest powerful genetic tools of the last decade, both in terms of data (genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, including uniparentally transmitted markers of the Y chromosome and of mitochondrial DNA) and of biostatistical methods to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity.",

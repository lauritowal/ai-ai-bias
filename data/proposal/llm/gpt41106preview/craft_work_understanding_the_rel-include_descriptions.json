        "Abstract:\n\nThe CRAFTWORK project represents an ambitious, pioneering investigation into the evolving nexus of identity and labor in the digital age. It seeks to unravel the complexities of ‘neo-craft’ work—a burgeoning yet underexplored domain of the modern European workforce. Through a robust, dual-pronged approach, combining digital and qualitative research methodologies, this pan-European study will delve into the personal and collective experiences, cultural practices, and societal perceptions of ‘neo-craft’ workers across diverse sectors and regions.\n\nA central aim of the project is to discern how these workers navigate their professional trajectories, perceive their socioeconomic standings, and engage with social media in relation to their crafts. CRAFTWORK will also examine the distribution of ‘neo-craft’ occupations along the urban-rural spectrum, offering insights into the spatial dimensions of this employment phenomenon. By doing so, the research endeavors to construct an innovative interpretive framework that captures the unique attributes of ‘new forms of work’, thereby shedding light on the changing character of work in the context of societal shift from industrial norms.\n\nThis groundbreaking project stands out for its empirical breadth—being the first of its kind to extensively probe ‘neo-craft’ work in the European Union. Methodologically, it breaks new ground by synthesizing digital analytics with traditional qualitative scrutiny. Theoretically, it aims to redefine conceptual tools necessary for analyzing work-related identity in an era marked by the coexistence of long-established and emerging occupational modalities. Ultimately, CRAFTWORK aspires to enrich academic discourse across various disciplines and address the pressing societal challenge of envisioning the 'future of work'.\n\nKeywords: neo-craft work, digital era, identity, work, European Union, social media, urban-rural divide, future of work."

To do so, it focuses on the lived experiences, cultures and practices of ‘neo-craft’ work across different sectors and geographical contexts in the EU. The project investigates the subjectivities and pathways to work of ‘neo-craft’ workers, their perception of class location and their cultural conceptions of social status. At the same time, it questions the distribution of ‘neo-craft’ work across the urban-rural divide, and the role of social media in this context. The overarching goal of the CRAFTWORK project is to produce a new interpretative framework to understand the relationship between identity and work, that allows to account for the specificities of the ‘new forms of work’. Conceived as such, the project will significantly innovate and empower the critical study of the ‘new forms of work’ across different disciplines and research areas, and contribute to address the major societal challenge of the ‘future of work’. The project is ground-breaking for three reasons: a) empirically, it is the first comprehensive inquiry on ‘neo-craft’ work, currently hidden in existing data, in the EU area; b) methodologically, it experiments an innovative combination of digital methods and qualitative research for the study of work; c) theoretically, it aspires to provide a rethinking of the interpretative categories for the study of the relationship between identity and work in the context of a society transitioning out of the industrial era and into a fragmented scenario, whereby old and new forms of work coexist.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for an ambitious research project aimed at understanding the impact of social media on conflict dynamics and peace-building efforts in Africa, with a particular focus on Eastern African communities affected by religious and political strife. As the Internet's reach extends to the most isolated regions of the world, facilitated by innovative technologies such as drones and satellites, there is a critical need to explore how this increased connectivity influences social structures, governance, and violence within fragile states.\n\nThe study will address a significant gap in current research by examining the nuanced ways in which social media platforms can both exacerbate and mitigate conflict. It will pursue this investigation through a series of interrelated research questions at different levels of analysis. At the macro level, the project will analyze the transnational effects of social media on conflict and peace-building. At the meso level, it will examine the responses of public authorities to social media, assessing whether they harness these platforms to fuel hostility or foster harmony. Finally, at the micro level, the project will delve into the personal experiences of individuals, exploring how their engagement with social media influences their involvement in, or disengagement from, violent conflict.\n\nThe research methodology will incorporate a comprehensive analysis of online \"dangerous speech,\" the movements of individuals into and out of conflict zones, the strategies employed by various actors to control or shape Internet discourse, and the approaches taken by governance actors to utilize social media in conflict-affected areas.\n\nBy providing evidence-based insights into the complex relationship between social media and conflict, this project will offer valuable information for policymakers, NGOs, and other stakeholders working towards peace and stability in regions plagued by violence."

While previous efforts to expand Internet access have focused on urban areas, current initiatives are leveraging new technologies from drones to satellites to provide affordable access to the worlds poorest, many of whom are in Africa and live in regions where the state is weak and there is protracted violent conflict. Current debates have largely focused on technical issues of improving access, or assumed ways that technology will help ‘liberate’ populations or improve governance. This project focuses on a key puzzle that is often overlooked: How does increased access to social media affect the balance between peace-building efforts and attempts perpetuate violence in conflict-affected communities? With a focus on Africa (and particularly on religious and political violence in Eastern Africa), this project will investigate the relationship between social media and conflict through three research questions at the macro, meso and micro level: how are social media altering the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? How are public authorities reacting to, and appropriating, social media to either encourage violence or promote peace? And in what ways are social media changing the way people experience, participate in, or respond to violent conflict? It will examine these questions in the context of dangerous speech online; the exit and entry of individuals away from, and into, conflict; the tactics and strategies actors adopt to shape the Internet; and how governance actors are leveraging social media in conflict-affected communities.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a comprehensive anthropological study entitled UNIVERSAL HEALTH, which aims to examine the implementation and impact of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in three African nations. UHC, a World Health Organization-endorsed initiative and a key component of the Sustainable Development Goals, strives to provide accessible healthcare services to all individuals without imposing financial hardship, thereby framing public health within the context of social justice and state responsibility. The study is particularly significant in Africa, where historical health policies have weakened state healthcare systems, leading to privatization and increased out-of-pocket expenses for the impoverished.\n\nThe proposed research will investigate how UHC, as a contested and adaptive policy, is interpreted and operationalized by different stakeholders, including policy-makers, bureaucrats, and citizens. It will delve into the complexities of state obligations, public good, and the interplay with existing formal and informal social support mechanisms that contribute to health and well-being. This investigation is crucial given that, historically, the pursuit of public good by African states has been inconsistent and fraught with conflicting interests.\n\nEmploying ethnographic methodologies, the study will conduct multi-sited and multi-level fieldwork to capture the nuanced interactions and frictions that arise at various stages of UHC policy-making, implementation, and public engagement. By focusing on the global, national, and local actors and institutions, the project endeavors to map out the intersections of UHC with national histories and social practices, revealing the unique dynamics at play in each country.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of UNIVERSAL HEALTH is to generate new scholarly insights that extend beyond the African context, contributing to a broader understanding of global health policies and the pursuit of the public good. This research promises to open fresh avenues of inquiry and provide valuable knowledge that can inform future health initiatives and policy decisions."

Defined by the WHO as ensuring that all people can use the health services they need without financial hardship, UHC is a powerful concept that approaches public health as a matter of justice and obligation and is included in the Sustainable Development Goals. UHC is particularly important in Africa, where structural-adjustment policies undermined state capacity, promoted privatization and pushed the burden of payment onto the poor. Recent global health initiatives have done little to address the neglect of national health-care systems and citizens’ lack of trust in them. In these contexts UHC is interesting because it reinserts questions of state responsibility and the public good into health-care. Historically however, African states have only partially pursued the public good, while in practice UHC is surrounding by conflicting interests. UHC is thus not a universal model but a contested field, making it an intriguing site for anthropological research. With a focus on actors and institutions at global, national and local levels in each country, the project will explore how moves towards UHC engage relations between states and citizens and universal concepts such as the public good; how UHC intersects with formal systems of social protection; and how it influences informal social networks that support health, thus situating UHC in national histories and social practices. Tracking the frictions surrounding UHC at the levels of policy-making, implementation, among beneficiaries, and in public debate, the project will use ethnographic methodology in innovative ways through fieldwork that is multi-sited and multi-level. The project’s focus on a global policy and the public good opens new research directions and will produce knowledge of relevance beyond Africa.",

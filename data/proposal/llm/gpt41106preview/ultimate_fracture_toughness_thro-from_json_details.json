        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Ultimate Fracture Toughness Through Thickness Engineering\" aims to revolutionize the structural integrity of materials used across critical industries—such as aeronautics, biomedical, nuclear, and pipeline—by enhancing their fracture resistance capabilities. Despite ongoing research since the 1960s, the magnitude of peak fracture toughness and the corresponding optimum plate thickness in metallic materials remain undefined. This initiative seeks to fill this knowledge gap by systematically investigating the dependence of fracture toughness on plate thickness, ranging from a fraction of a millimeter to ten millimeters.\n\nOur multidisciplinary approach focuses on creating fail-safe designs without altering material chemistry or inventing new microstructures. Instead, we will employ strategies including the selection and control of plate thickness, especially in the context of thin-walled applications and thick laminates. The project will leverage high strain hardening capacity to achieve unattained cracking resistance. \n\nThe research plan includes acquiring new experimental fracture data, conducting advanced 3D finite element simulations, enhancing micromechanical models, extending materials selection approaches, processing and assembling ultra-tough metal laminates, and developing a new concept for laminate pressure vessels. These efforts are anticipated to lead to significant weight reduction in structural components by a factor of up to five, while simultaneously optimizing the structural design.\n\nAs a result, we expect to establish a novel paradigm in fracture mechanics that will not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of fracture toughness but also provide tangible benefits to the associated fields through improved material performance. The anticipated outcomes of this project have the potential to set a new industry standard for manufacturing safer, lighter, and more reliable components, ultimately contributing to economic savings and enhanced safety regulations."

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Functional Systems of Capsules,\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of chemical systems through the development of innovative tools that exploit guest-binding capsules for engineering functional chemical networks. The primary objectives are to elucidate the foundational principles of biology and to enable the design and creation of new chemical networks that possess specific, targeted functions. Our approach incorporates the use of guest-binding capsules designed to respond to various signals, including light, to induce transformations in the guests or to facilitate their movement between different phases. Furthermore, we aim to manipulate these systems to selectively alter guest binding properties and to control the release and uptake of catalysts, thus accelerating or impeding catalyzed transformations. Through our methods, we expect to foster the emergence of complex behaviors from abiological systems, characterized by intricate cycles and feedback loops. Our research is poised to unveil novel ways to transform guests, influence their phase behavior, and amplify their reactivity, ultimately contributing to the advancement of chemical and biological sciences by showcasing the potential of abiological systems to mimic and extend the capabilities of living organisms.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Functional Systems of Capsules\" project seeks to push the frontiers of chemical science by developing innovative tools to engineer functional chemical systems via guest-binding capsules. These systems are devised to respond to a variety of signals, mirroring the complex interactions found within biological subsystems. Our objectives are twofold: to deepen our understanding of the foundational principles underlying biological processes and to construct novel chemical networks that exhibit specific, targeted functions.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we propose to use guest-binding capsules to engineer chemical systems with the capacity for transformative responses to light and other signals. Our methods include the reversible and irreversible alteration of host properties, selective binding of guests, and the controlled release and uptake of catalysts, enabling the acceleration or inhibition of catalytic transformations.\n\nAnticipated outcomes of our research include the ability to pump guests between phases, modify guest binding properties, and facilitate the emergence of complex behavior in abiological systems. These advances will lead to the design of intricate systems characterized by cycles and feedback loops that mimic the dynamic nature of living organisms. This project holds the promise of revolutionizing the way we understand, interact with, and harness chemical systems for a range of applications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Functional Systems of Capsules\" project proposes an innovative approach to developing new tools for engineering functional chemical systems through guest-binding capsules that exhibit complex behaviors in response to various stimuli. The primary objectives are to elucidate the foundational principles of biology and to design and create new chemical networks with targeted functions. Our methodology employs the use of guest-binding capsules, which are engineered to respond to signals, notably light, to transform guests or facilitate phase transitions. We aim to manipulate these capsules to achieve reversible and irreversible changes in host properties, as well as to regulate the release and uptake of catalysts, thereby controlling the speed and direction of catalysed transformations.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes include the ability to transform guests in novel ways, pump them between phases, alter guest binding properties selectively, and modulate catalytic processes either to accelerate or impede them. Our research expects to unveil the emergence of complex behaviors from abiological systems, leading to the design of systems characterized by intricate cycles and feedback loops. This project holds the potential to revolutionize our understanding of chemical interactions and to foster the development of new chemical technologies with far-reaching implications for various scientific disciplines.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Functional Systems of Capsules\" project aims to revolutionize the field of chemical engineering by developing innovative tools for constructing functional chemical systems through the use of guest-binding capsules. These engineered systems will provide profound insights into the foundational principles of biology and pave the way for the design and creation of novel chemical networks tailored for specific functions. Employing a multidisciplinary approach, the project will explore how these capsules can respond to a range of signals, including light, to initiate transformations in guest molecules or facilitate their movement between different phases. Methods will include reversible and irreversible modification of the host capsules, selective alteration of guest binding properties, and precise control over catalytic processes through the strategic release and uptake of catalysts. The research is designed to culminate in the emergence of sophisticated behavior in abiological systems, characterized by complex cycles and feedback loops. This innovative endeavor promises to deliver unprecedented ways to manipulate chemical systems, offering potential breakthroughs in material science, biotechnology, and beyond."

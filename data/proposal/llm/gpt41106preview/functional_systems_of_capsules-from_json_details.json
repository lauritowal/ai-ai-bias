        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Functional Systems of Capsules\" project aims to revolutionize the field of chemical engineering by developing innovative tools for constructing functional chemical systems through the use of guest-binding capsules. These engineered systems will provide profound insights into the foundational principles of biology and pave the way for the design and creation of novel chemical networks tailored for specific functions. Employing a multidisciplinary approach, the project will explore how these capsules can respond to a range of signals, including light, to initiate transformations in guest molecules or facilitate their movement between different phases. Methods will include reversible and irreversible modification of the host capsules, selective alteration of guest binding properties, and precise control over catalytic processes through the strategic release and uptake of catalysts. The research is designed to culminate in the emergence of sophisticated behavior in abiological systems, characterized by complex cycles and feedback loops. This innovative endeavor promises to deliver unprecedented ways to manipulate chemical systems, offering potential breakthroughs in material science, biotechnology, and beyond."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Assisting Coral Reef Survival in the Face of Climate Change\n\nThe survival of coral reefs, essential to marine biodiversity and ecosystem services, is under severe threat from climate-induced thermal stress. This proposal, \"Assisting Coral Reef Survival in the Face of Climate Change,\" aims to establish the feasibility of using assisted gene flow (AGF) to enhance the thermotolerance of reef-building corals. By integrating disciplines such as evolutionary biology, restoration ecology, and proteomics, the project sets out to sustain coral reef biodiversity and functionality amid escalating climate pressures.\n\nOur approach involves selective breeding and the translocation of thermotolerant individuals to promote genetic resilience within vulnerable coral populations. The research will focus on determining if there are resource trade-offs between increased thermotolerance and other vital fitness traits in corals. Additionally, we aim to identify the physiological and proteomic traits that correlate with increased individual thermotolerance and to assess the heritability of these phenotypic traits.\n\nUsing state-of-the-art proteomic techniques and innovative translocation methods, we will measure phenotypic traits in permanently tagged coral individuals across selected populations. This will enable us to establish the relationship between thermotolerance and key fitness attributes, and to evaluate the long-term heritability of thermotolerance. The project's ultimate goal is to test the large-scale feasibility of AGF as a strategy for coral reef ecosystem conservation.\n\nBy answering critical research questions and employing cutting-edge methodologies, this project will provide essential knowledge to guide conservation efforts and policy decisions aimed at protecting coral reefs in a warming world. The outcomes will inform whether AGF and selective breeding can lead to persistent shifts in thermotolerance in recipient coral populations, thereby offering a lifeline to these vital ecosystems."

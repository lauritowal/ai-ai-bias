        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a pioneering research program aimed at addressing one of the most critical challenges in increasingly diverse societies: the imperative for intergroup tolerance to foster harmonious and productive coexistence. Despite the centrality of tolerance in navigating cultural diversity, the lack of systematic social psychological investigation into intergroup toleration represents a significant gap in contemporary scholarship. This research seeks to bridge this gap by advancing our understanding beyond the realms of stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination, and focusing on the endurance of differences within the social psychology of intergroup toleration.\n\nThe proposed research will dissect the multifaceted nature of toleration through four key aspects: the psychological underpinnings that drive objecting to outgroups (objection component), the mental processes that facilitate acceptance (acceptance component), the boundaries that define the extent of tolerance (rejection component), and the effects experienced by those who are tolerated (consequences component). Utilizing a robust theoretical framework, the investigation will employ an innovative methodological approach, combining survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments with EEG technology, to capture a comprehensive picture of intergroup tolerance.\n\nThe outcomes of this research are expected to produce critical insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration, which will be instrumental in shaping policies and practices aimed at nurturing a more tolerant society. The significance of this research is underlined by the pressing need for evidence-based strategies to navigate the complexities of cultural diversity. This groundbreaking and timely research promises to make a substantial contribution to social sciences and the pursuit of egalitarian, peaceful coexistence."

In Europe, intergroup tolerance has been proposed as a key aspect of living harmoniously and productively with diversity; it is critical because objection and disagreement about what is good and right are inevitable. A diverse, egalitarian, and peaceful society does not require that we all like each other, but it does require that people at least tolerate one another. Yet, there has been very little by way of social psychological theorizing and systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration. This research will advance the state of the art in the social sciences by moving beyond intergroup stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination, and focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration in which differences are endured. This new line of research will unravel the interrelated aspects of toleration. We will elucidate: (1) the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance (the objection component), 2) the psychological processes underlying tolerance (the acceptance component), 3) the limits of tolerance (the rejection component), and 4) the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. This program has a coherent theoretical framework and empirically toleration will be examined by using a combination of survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG. The research will provide key insights into the social psychological dynamics of intergroup toleration. This can form the basis for developing and implementing initiatives and approaches that contribute to a more tolerant society. Given the contested nature of cultural diversity and the absence of systematic social psychological investigations, the proposed research is both ground-breaking and timely.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Inside the mind of a voter - Memory, Identity, and Electoral Psychology,\" aims to delve into the cognitive and emotional underpinnings of voter behavior during elections and referenda. Using a multi-methodological approach that includes interviews, experiments, and surveys, the project seeks to achieve several objectives: to understand voter behavior, to analyze the long-term coherence of such behavior, to study the undecided electorate, and to examine shifts in voter decisions leading up to elections.\n\nThe research will span two series of interviews and will generate significant scholarly outputs, including four books and five major journal articles, along with additional articles and chapters. The anticipated breakthroughs in understanding electoral behavior will be contextualized within the current climate of political dealignment, providing insights into the logic of participation, the decision-making process of the undecided electorate, and the psychology underpinning referendum voting. \n\nA central ambition of the project is the creation of Europe's only Centre for Research in Electoral Psychology, which will serve as a hub for understanding the expressive value of the vote and the intersection between personal identity and electoral memory. This institution will not only foster academic research but also engage the wider community through workshops, seminars, and a large conference, positioning itself as a leader in the field.\n\nThe project promises to provide significant contributions to the study of electoral psychology by elucidating the factors that shape voter decisions and behavior, thereby enhancing the democratic process. Its unique position in Europe and comprehensive range of activities make it an innovative and valuable endeavor for the academic community and beyond."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe grant proposal \"Inside the mind of a voter - Memory, Identity, and Electoral Psychology\" aims to initiate a groundbreaking study into the cognitive processes influencing voter behavior, particularly during the critical moments of decision-making in elections and referenda. This interdisciplinary project encapsulates focus areas of electoral memory, identity, and psychology through a robust methodology that includes interviews, experiments, and surveys, with the ambition of conducting two extensive interview series. The objectives are multi-faceted, aiming to understand voter behavior, analyze its long-term coherence, study the undecided electorate, and examine the dynamics of changing opinions pre-election.\n\nThe project anticipates producing a significant body of research, consisting of four books and five major journal articles, alongside additional articles and chapters. These outputs are expected to contribute to a major breakthrough in our understanding of electoral behavior, particularly in the context of the current climate of political dealignment. Furthermore, the project will lead to the establishment of Europe's only Centre for Research in Electoral Psychology, thereby cementing its position as a critical hub for scholarly inquiry and dialogue in this field.\n\nThe expected impact extends beyond academia, influencing how political campaigns, policymakers, and civil society engage with the electorate. Anticipated outcomes include insights into the long-term coherence of voter behavior, the decision-making logic of the undecided electorate, the psychology underpinning referendum voting, the expressive value of the vote, and the logic behind voter participation.\n\nIn addition to the research outputs, the proposal outlines plans for institutional development and community engagement through the organization of workshops, seminars, and a large conference. These events aim to foster collaboration, disseminate research findings, and stimulate further studies in electoral psychology. The creation of a dedicated Centre for Research in Electoral Psychology will ensure the sustainability of this endeavor and position Europe at the forefront of this critical field of research.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Inside the mind of a voter - Memory, Identity, and Electoral Psychology,\" seeks to delve into the intricate psychological mechanisms that govern voter behavior during elections and referenda. At the heart of this groundbreaking research is the objective to comprehend the long-term coherence of electoral choices, the decision-making logic of the undecided electorate, the psychological dynamics in referendum voting, and the expressive value of the vote.\n\nEmploying a robust methodology that includes a series of interviews, controlled experiments, and extensive surveys, the research endeavors to analyze and document the internal cognitive processes that lead to voter decision-making. The project will be conducted through two comprehensive interview series, enabling a deep exploration of the psychological factors influencing voter identity and electoral memory.\n\nAnticipated to yield substantial academic contributions, the project will produce four books and five major journal articles, along with additional articles and chapters. These outputs are expected to herald a significant breakthrough in the understanding of electoral behavior, particularly in the context of a shifting political landscape characterized by dealignment.\n\nFurthermore, the project aims to establish Europe's only Centre for Research in Electoral Psychology, a pioneering institution dedicated to the study of electoral psychology. This center will serve as a nexus for scholarly exchange, hosting an array of events including workshops, seminars, and a large conference, fostering collaboration and furthering research in this vital field.\n\nBy examining the intricate relationship between memory, identity, and electoral psychology, the project stands poised to offer unprecedented insights into voter behavior, contributing not only to academic discourse but also to the practical understanding of electoral dynamics, thereby enhancing democratic processes.\n\nKeywords: electoral behavior, voter psychology, decision-making, electoral psychology, political identity, memory",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Inside the mind of a voter - Memory, Identity, and Electoral Psychology\" is designed to delve into the complex cognitive processes that guide voters during elections and referenda. Utilizing a multi-methodological approach that includes interviews, experiments, and surveys, our research team aims to uncover the intricacies of electoral memory, the intertwining of personal identity with political decisions, and the overarching psychological factors that influence voter behavior.\n\nOver the course of the study, two series of interviews will be conducted to gain qualitative insights, supplemented by experiments and surveys to quantify trends and patterns within the electorate. The project has set forth ambitious goals to understand the long-term coherence of voter behavior, analyze the decision-making logic of the undecided electorate, and examine the factors that lead to changes in voter attitudes before casting their ballots, with a particular focus on the psychology of referendum voting.\n\nAnticipated outputs of this comprehensive study are substantial, including the publication of four books and five major journal articles, alongside additional articles and chapters in relevant publications. These outputs are expected to contribute significantly to a breakthrough understanding of electoral behavior, particularly in the context of political dealignment.\n\nA pivotal aspect of the project is the establishment of Europe's only Centre for Research in Electoral Psychology. This institution will serve as a hub for scholarly exchange, hosting workshops, seminars, and a large conference to disseminate research findings and foster dialogue among experts in the field.\n\nThe project promises not only to provide an unprecedented look into the voter's mind but also to serve as a cornerstone for future research and policy-making, with the potential to reshape our understanding of electoral engagement in the modern era.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Inside the mind of a voter - Memory, Identity, and Electoral Psychology,\" aims to delve into the cognitive and emotional underpinnings of voter behavior during elections and referenda. Using a multi-methodological approach that includes interviews, experiments, and surveys, the project seeks to achieve several objectives: to understand voter behavior, to analyze the long-term coherence of such behavior, to study the undecided electorate, and to examine shifts in voter decisions leading up to elections.\n\nThe research will span two series of interviews and will generate significant scholarly outputs, including four books and five major journal articles, along with additional articles and chapters. The anticipated breakthroughs in understanding electoral behavior will be contextualized within the current climate of political dealignment, providing insights into the logic of participation, the decision-making process of the undecided electorate, and the psychology underpinning referendum voting. \n\nA central ambition of the project is the creation of Europe's only Centre for Research in Electoral Psychology, which will serve as a hub for understanding the expressive value of the vote and the intersection between personal identity and electoral memory. This institution will not only foster academic research but also engage the wider community through workshops, seminars, and a large conference, positioning itself as a leader in the field.\n\nThe project promises to provide significant contributions to the study of electoral psychology by elucidating the factors that shape voter decisions and behavior, thereby enhancing the democratic process. Its unique position in Europe and comprehensive range of activities make it an innovative and valuable endeavor for the academic community and beyond."

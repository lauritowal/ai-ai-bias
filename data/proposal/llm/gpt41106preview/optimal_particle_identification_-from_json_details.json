        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Optimal Particle identification Of Single Site events with Underground MKIDs detectors\" (OPOSSUM) project aims to make groundbreaking advancements in the detection of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0νββ) to affirm the Majorana nature of neutrinos and to gain a deeper understanding of the absolute neutrino mass scale and hierarchy. Despite the exceptional energy resolution offered by current ton-scale arrays of bolometers, such as CUORE, which operates at millikelvin temperatures investigating the 130Te isotope, the challenge remains to detect the monochromatic peak at MeV levels that emanate from processes with half-lives exceeding 1e26 years. These experiments are currently hindered by background event identification issues.\n\nOPOSSUM proposes a novel approach by augmenting 12 CUORE crystals with 6 Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) and a thermistor per crystal, leveraging their rapid deployment within the existing setup. This enhancement will enable precise event classification, distinguishing Single Site Events from Multi Site Events through pulse-shape analysis, achieving a 3σ distinction from background noise. The project anticipates reducing the background from 10^-2 to below 10^-4 counts/keV/kg/year, marking a significant step towards the first bolometric ton-scale, background-free experiment.\n\nCrucially, the proposed solution does not necessitate a major financial outlay or extensive R&D, thanks to its compatibility with current technology and infrastructure. Looking ahead, the future OPOSSUM-1ton project aims to scale these advancements, maintaining a focus on the goal of achieving a Majorana mass sensitivity below 10 meV. This proposal follows recommendations from the EU Astroparticle committee for the neutrino physics programme and is backed by the applicant's extensive expertise in experimental low-temperature detectors. If successful, OPOSSUM will set a new standard for neutrino experiments and could significantly contribute to our understanding of fundamental particle physics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Optimal Particle identification Of Single Site events with Underground MKIDs detectors\" (OPOSSUM) project aims to make a groundbreaking advancement in the detection of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0νββ), a process which, if observed, could confirm the Majorana nature of neutrinos and provide critical insights into the absolute mass scale and hierarchy of these elusive particles. Existing bolometric experiments like CUORE, which operate at millikelvin temperatures and target the 130Te isotope, have paved the way with exceptional energy resolution but still face significant challenges in background event discrimination.\n\nOPOSSUM intends to revolutionize this field by implementing Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) and a thermistor in conjunction with the existing 12 CUORE TeO2 crystals. This novel approach will enable pulse-shape analysis for event classification, distinguishing with 3σ confidence Single Site Events from Multi Site Events and other background interferences. Anticipated reduction in background levels is substantial, from 10^-2 to below 10^-4 counts/keV/kg/year, moving towards a truly background-free experiment.\n\nThe project promises rapid deployment within the existing CUORE setup, requiring minimal R&D and not a major financial outlay. It sets the stage for the future OPOSSUM-1ton extension, aiming to become the first bolometric ton-scale, background-free experiment with the potential to achieve a Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity of less than 10 meV.\n\nDrawing on the applicant's vast experience in low-temperature detectors and following recommendations from the EU Astroparticle committee, OPOSSUM stands as a highly anticipated endeavor in the neutrino physics programme. It is poised to deliver a transformative capability for the detection of 0νββ, thereby propelling our understanding of neutrino properties and fundamental particle physics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe quest to elucidate the fundamental nature of neutrinos and the absolute neutrino mass scale is pivotal in understanding the universe's underlying structure. The \"Optimal Particle identification Of Single Site events with Underground MKIDs detectors\" (OPOSSUM) project seeks to address one of the most elusive phenomena in particle physics: neutrinoless double-beta decay (0νββ). By confirming the occurrence of 0νββ, we aim to affirm the Majorana nature of neutrinos and gain crucial insights into the neutrino mass hierarchy. OPOSSUM presents an innovative experimental approach to overcome the daunting challenge of detecting 0νββ events, which are characterized by a monochromatic peak at MeV levels and half-lives exceeding 1e26 years.\n\nBuilding upon the existing CUORE experiment's infrastructure, which utilizes ton-scale arrays of TeO2 bolometers to investigate the 130Te isotope, OPOSSUM proposes a significant technological enhancement. By equipping 12 CUORE crystals with six Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) each and an additional thermistor, the project aims to dramatically improve event discrimination through pulse-shape analysis, allowing for a 3σ distinction from background signals. This methodology is expected to reduce the background levels from 10^-2 to below 10^-4 counts/keV/kg/year, propelling us toward the first bolometric ton-scale, background-free experiment.\n\nOPOSSUM's rapid deployment within the existing CUORE setup, minimal R&D requirements, and modest financial outlay make it an exceptionally feasible project with transformative potential. With vast experimental expertise in low-temperature detectors, the applicant is well-positioned to execute this project, which is strongly recommended by the EU Astroparticle committee within the neutrino physics programme. The successful implementation of OPOSSUM will pave the way for the future OPOSSUM-1ton project, with the ambitious goal of reducing the Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity to below 10 meV, thus significantly advancing our understanding of neutrino physics.",
        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Optimal Particle identification Of Single Site events with Underground MKIDs detectors (OPOSSUM)\"\n\nThe OPOSSUM project aims to make a monumental stride in particle physics by detecting neutrinoless double-beta decay (0νββ) to confirm the Majorana nature of neutrinos and gain insights into the absolute mass scale and hierarchy of neutrinos. Current attempts to observe these rare events utilize ton-scale arrays of bolometers, such as CUORE, which operates at millikelvin temperatures and targets the 130Te isotope. However, these technologies face significant challenges in identifying the monochromatic decay signal at MeV levels, given the decay's exceedingly long half-life of over 1e26 years.\n\nOPOSSUM proposes an innovative approach by upgrading 12 CUORE crystals with six Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) each and a thermistor. This setup is designed to enhance event classification between Single Site Events and Multi Site Events through pulse-shape analysis, achieving a 3σ distinction from background noise. The anticipated outcome is a groundbreaking reduction in background levels from 10^-2 to below 10^-4 counts/keV/kg/year, paving the way for the first bolometric ton-scale, background-free experiment.\n\nRapid deployment within the existing setup is a significant advantage, requiring minimal R&D and not a major financial outlay. This approach aligns with the recommendations of the EU Astroparticle committee and builds upon the applicant's extensive experimental knowledge in low-temperature detectors. The successful execution of OPOSSUM will set the foundation for the future OPOSSUM-1ton project, with the goal of directly observing 0νββ and achieving a Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity of less than 10 meV.\n\nThis project not only promises to revolutionize our understanding of the fundamental properties of neutrinos, but also serves as a critical stepping stone towards the establishment of a new standard in particle detection technology, contributing to our overarching goal of unraveling the mysteries of the universe."

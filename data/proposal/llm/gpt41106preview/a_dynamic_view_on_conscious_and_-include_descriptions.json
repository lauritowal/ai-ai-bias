        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal aims to explore the dynamic underpinnings of conscious and unconscious processing in the human mind, an area that remains largely uncharted in cognitive neuroscience. Traditional research paradigms have often adopted static approaches when probing these processes, limiting our understanding of their true nature. Our project proposes a multifaceted investigation to unpack these phenomena through innovative behavioral and neuroimaging techniques across three distinct but interconnected lines of inquiry.\n\nThe first track focuses on unconscious perception, challenging the static status quo by examining how our visual system processes continuous, unconscious information streams. By employing Gaze-Contingent Substitution to present subliminal videos and stimulus sequences, we aim to illuminate the dynamics of unconscious visual processing.\n\nIn the second track, we shift our gaze to conscious perception and its relationship with prior knowledge. Leveraging a Bayesian framework, we will dissect the cognitive mechanisms that integrate historical data to reconstruct perceptual experiences, particularly under conditions of limited awareness.\n\nThe third track addresses the developmental trajectory of consciousness, probing whether it emerges through the maturation of sensory-encoding posterior brain regions or attention-regulating anterior prefrontal areas. Our approach will utilize psychophysical and high-density EEG methods to differentiate conscious from unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants.\n\nThe projected outcomes of this research include providing empirical evidence for complex, sequential, subliminal influences, detailing cognitive mechanisms that contribute to perceptual illusions, and offering novel insights into the developmental onset of consciousness. This project promises to make significant contributions to our understanding of the human mind, with implications for various fields including psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence."

Most research on this topic has been limited to a static perspective, by studying static stimuli, by considering processing as a function of present information, and by focusing on a single, adult stage of development. Yet, both conscious and unconscious mental processes are intrinsically driven by dynamic properties. We will study these properties by relying on behavioral and brain imaging methods along three tracks: 1) Unconscious perception: Our visual system is, in real life, constantly receiving unconscious sequences of information that will generate dynamic and constantly updated processing streams. We will study these dynamic unconscious streams, thanks to Gaze-Contingent Substitution, a novel approach allowing for the presentation of subliminal videos and sequences of stimuli. 2) Conscious perception: Construction of a conscious percept does not only depend on present stimulation but also on interactions with prior knowledge. Relying on the Bayesian framework, we will study the mechanisms by which prior knowledge leads to the reconstruction of perceptual contents, by \"filling-in\" missing information during situations of partial awareness. 3) The maturation of consciousness: Using both psychophysical measures of visibility thresholds and high-density EEG, we will study the neural distinction between conscious and unconscious processes in pre-verbal infants, and whether consciousness develops through the maturation of posterior brain regions encoding sensory information, or rather anterior prefrontal regions related to attention and executive control. The expected impact of the project will be 1) to evidence sequential and complex forms of subliminal influences 2) to specify the cognitive mechanisms leading to perceptual illusions 3) to provide new insights on the mystery of how consciousness develops in humans.",

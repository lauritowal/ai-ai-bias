        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Metal-Organic REagents for Light-Enabled Shuttling of protons and electrons\" (More4Less) project proposes a transformative approach to solar-to-chemicals conversion by developing novel metal-organic reagents capable of efficiently shuttling protons and electrons using renewable resources such as water and sunlight. The project's central strategy involves advancing the understanding and practice of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) to address the crucial challenges in energy conversion technologies, particularly the reduction of N2, CO, and CO2. The proposal sets forth three core objectives: (1) to merge light and electricity in a photoelectrocatalytic strategy using molecular shuttles for reductive PCET, preventing the formation of H2 and exploiting counter oxidation reactions; (2) to achieve control over multi PCET for selective reductive transformations by colocalizing redox and acid/base sites within coordination cages; and (3) to integrate photo(electro)catalytic PCET in small molecule catalysis for the reduction of N2, utilizing light and water.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of the More4Less project include the development of unconventional tools to manipulate reductive reaction mechanisms, considerable advancements in the knowledge of PCET and energy conversion processes, and a paradigm shift in the development of catalytic systems for solar-to-chemical transformations. These objectives align with the broader goals of promoting sustainable energy conversion and mitigating the reliance on non-renewable resources. The project's success in harnessing PCET for solar energy conversion has the potential to significantly impact the field of renewable energy, paving the way for cleaner and more efficient chemical production processes.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Metal-Organic REagents for Light-Enabled Shuttling of protons and electrons (More4Less)\n\nThe More4Less project proposes a groundbreaking approach to solar-to-chemicals conversion by developing innovative Metal-Organic Reagents (MORs) capable of light-enabled shuttling of protons and electrons. This project aims to address the pressing need for renewable energy sources by utilizing abundant resources such as water and sunlight to drive the reduction of nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) without forming hydrogen gas as a byproduct.\n\nThe key strategy of our proposal is focused on Proton Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET), a process that can facilitate the conversion of solar energy into chemical bonds. The challenges we intend to overcome include the development of PCET shuttles that can function as catalysts, promotion of multi PCET to bypass unstable radical intermediates, and the integration of these shuttles into complex multielectron/multiproton transformations essential for efficient solar energy conversion.\n\nOur objectives are threefold: First, we will design MOR-based PCET shuttles for a novel photoelectrocatalytic strategy that merges light and electricity, utilizing molecular shuttles to facilitate counter oxidation reactions. Second, we aim to achieve control over multi PCET processes to ensure selectivity in reductive transformations, which will be accomplished by the colocalization of redox and acid/base sites within coordination cages. Lastly, we will integrate photo(electro)catalytic PCET into small molecule catalysis for the reduction of N2, exploiting light and water as primary resources.\n\nThe potential impacts of More4Less are substantial, including the provision of unconventional tools to affect mechanisms of reductive reactions, advancement of knowledge in the field of PCET and energy conversion, and a paradigm shift in the development of catalytic systems for solar-to-chemical transformation. If successful, this project will not only contribute to the scientific community's understanding of PCET but also pave the way for a sustainable method of synthesizing essential chemicals using the power of the sun.",

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Extracellular Matrix as a Mediator of Cell-Cell Communication in Cardiovascular Inflammation\n\nCardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction (MI), and heart failure, represent the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with atherosclerosis as the primary pathology. The project MATRICARD aims to dissect the intricate role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cardiovascular inflammation and its impact on disease progression. The ECM is not only a structural entity but also a dynamic and complex network that transmits mechanical stimuli and facilitates cell-cell communication—crucial in both chronic and acute phases of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that genetic variations affecting ECM proteins are strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases. This project proposes a comprehensive approach to explore the ECM proteome in the context of sterile inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and MI. We will identify novel regulators and understand the underlying processes that govern cell-cell interactions and disease modulation—focusing on various cell types involved, including leukocytes, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, platelets, fibroblasts, and cardiomyocytes.\n\nThe research aims to advance beyond current technical boundaries, deepen knowledge of ECM-mediated cell-cell communication, and reveal translational potential by identifying novel therapeutic targets. We anticipate that our findings will pave the way for the development of individualized treatment strategies and enable the translation of our findings to human clinical trials.\n\nThe MATRICARD project is poised to provide groundbreaking insights into the ECM's role in cardiovascular diseases and open new avenues for therapeutic interventions. The multidisciplinary approach combines cutting-edge proteomics, genetics, cell biology, and clinical research, setting the stage to revolutionize the management of cardiovascular inflammation and its sequelae."

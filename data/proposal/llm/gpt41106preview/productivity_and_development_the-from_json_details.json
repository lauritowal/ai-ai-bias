        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Productivity and Development: The Ready-made Garment Productivity Project\" is a pioneering research initiative dedicated to advancing the understanding of manufacturing productivity within the developing world, with a particular focus on the ready-made garment sector. Recognizing the critical role of productivity in fostering economic development and poverty reduction, this project seeks to explore the substantial productivity variations within and across garment manufacturing firms in low-income countries.\n\nEmploying a novel and comprehensive research approach, the project will collect sub-factory production and survey data from hundreds of garment manufacturers across several developing countries. A new method of productivity measurement will be used to compare physical productivity across different units, assessing intra-firm, inter-firm, and product heterogeneity. Initial findings in Bangladesh, involving 100 factories, reveal significant productivity dispersion, with the 90th percentile being 50% more efficient than the 10th. This dispersion underscores the potential for substantial efficiency gains.\n\nThe project will also investigate factors influencing productivity, such as capital investment and the quality of buyers, contextual challenges like general strikes and significant minimum wage increases, and interventions like two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on line supervisor training. In addition, the project includes the development of tools to facilitate data collection and analysis, as well as programs to address worker well-being.\n\nCollaborations have been established with the garment association in Myanmar and European buyers, and benchmarking efforts have begun with Pakistan's garment factories. The future goals of the project over the next two years include expanding the data collection to 6 to 8 countries across Asia and Africa, enabling an unprecedented level of detail in cross-country analysis.\n\nThis project promises to deliver unparalleled insights into the determinants of productivity, offering evidence-based strategies to enhance efficiency and drive development within the garment industry of the developing world."

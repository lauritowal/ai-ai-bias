        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Cryptography from Unstructured Hardness\" aims to revolutionize the field of cryptography by addressing the fundamental question of whether unbreakable encryption methods can be established. Our reliance on conjectured hardness of problems such as factoring, discrete logarithms, and noisy linear algebra, which possess significant algebraic structure, introduces vulnerabilities and limits the number of robust problems available for essential cryptographic tasks like key exchange and public-key encryption.\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a new theoretical foundation for cryptography based on unstructured hardness assumptions derived from Kolmogorov Complexity. By exploring the connection between this measure of randomness and cryptographic security, we aim to overcome structural vulnerabilities and the shortage of candidate problems that currently underpin the security of our cryptographic systems. The project will focus on three core tasks: encryption, authentication, and key exchange, with a particular emphasis on private-key encryption, key-exchange mechanisms, and public-key encryption, which are most susceptible to the limitations of current hardness assumptions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the establishment of a new set of hardness assumptions based on a lack of structural characteristics, thereby offering a more secure foundation for cryptography. We anticipate that this breakthrough will not only fortify the security of the Internet but will also have long-term implications for the reliability and trustworthiness of all systems dependent on cryptographic security. By pioneering a novel approach that connects cryptography with unstructured computational hardness, this project aspires to lay the groundwork for a more resilient digital world."

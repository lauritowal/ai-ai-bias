        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Cryptography from Unstructured Hardness,\" aims to address the fundamental question of whether unbreakable encryption methods can exist by challenging the current reliance on the conjectured hardness of well-structured computational problems such as the factoring and discrete logarithms problems. Recognizing the inherent vulnerability of cryptographic tasks, which are predominantly based on a limited set of conjectured hard problems, this project seeks to develop a new theoretical foundation for cryptography that is grounded in unstructured hardness assumptions.\n\nThe core of the proposal is to explore the novel connection between cryptography and Kolmogorov Complexityâ€”a measure of the randomness and structurelessness of data. By focusing on private-key encryption, key exchange, and public-key encryption tasks, the research will leverage the lack of structure inherent in Kolmogorov Complexity to generate new hardness assumptions that could potentially overcome the structural vulnerabilities plaguing current cryptographic systems.\n\nThe project has two primary goals: firstly, to develop new hardness assumptions based on Kolmogorov Complexity that are devoid of algebraic structure and thus less susceptible to attacks; and secondly, to apply these assumptions to create provably-secure cryptographic tasks. The outcome is expected to provide a more robust theoretical underpinning for the hardness assumptions on which modern cryptography is based, thereby leading to a more secure foundation for the Internet and other digital platforms where security and privacy are paramount.\n\nIn the long term, the project promises to have significant impact by not only advancing our understanding of the NP vs. P problem and related computational complexities but also by making tangible contributions to the security infrastructure that underlies our digital society.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Cryptography from Unstructured Hardness\" aims to address the core question of whether unbreakable encryption methods can exist by exploring the potential of unstructured hardness assumptions. Traditional cryptographic systems heavily rely on the conjectured hardness of well-known computational problems, such as the factoring problem, discrete logarithms, and noisy linear algebra problems. These problems, however, possess significant algebraic structure, which makes them vulnerable to potential attacks. Moreover, the field suffers from a scarcity of hard problems that can serve as the foundation for essential cryptographic tasks like key exchange and public-key encryption.\n\nOur proposal seeks to develop a new theoretical foundation for cryptography by establishing a novel connection between cryptographic hardness and Kolmogorov Complexity, a measure of randomness that lacks algebraic structure. By leveraging this unexploited area, we aim to overcome the structural vulnerabilities present in current cryptographic tasks and to devise new hardness assumptions that can underpin private-key encryption, key exchange, and public-key encryption. This approach promises to mitigate the risk associated with the limited number of candidate problems currently employed in cryptographic applications.\n\nThe expected outcome of this project is a groundbreaking theoretical framework for hardness assumptions in cryptography, providing a more secure foundation for the Internet and other applications requiring stringent security measures. By redefining the basis of cryptographic security, this research has the potential to bring forth a paradigm shift in the field of cryptography, offering robust protection against the constantly evolving landscape of cyber threats.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Cryptography from Unstructured Hardness\" aims to revolutionize the field of cryptography by challenging the existing reliance on structured computational problems. The core question driving this research is the existence of unbreakable encryption methods, intimately tied to the pivotal NP vs. P problem. Our current cryptographic systems are built upon conjectured hardness of problems with significant algebraic structure, such as the factoring problem, the discrete logarithms problem, and noisy linear algebra problems. These structural characteristics present vulnerabilities that can be exploited through potential attacks, and our cryptographic tasks are limited to a few such problems, particularly for key exchange and public-key encryption.\n\nThis proposal outlines an ambitious goal: to develop a provably-secure cryptographic foundation based on unstructured hardness assumptions, leveraging a novel connection between cryptography and Kolmogorov Complexity. This new approach seeks to eliminate reliance on algebraic structures, thereby overcoming inherent vulnerabilities and providing a more secure foundation for protecting privacy and ensuring security in the digital realm.\n\nOur project will focus on the development of private-key encryption, key-exchange, and public-key encryption tasks based on these new assumptions. The expected outcome is to establish a new theoretical foundation for the hardness assumptions that underpin cryptography, with long-term implications for fostering a more secure foundation for the Internet and beyond.\n\nBy exploring this new direction, we anticipate addressing the limitations of current cryptographic systems and setting a course for future research that can withstand the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. This grant proposal requests funding to support the pioneering work necessary to achieve these transformative goals.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Cryptography from Unstructured Hardness\" aims to revolutionize the field of cryptography by addressing the fundamental question of whether unbreakable encryption methods can be established. Our reliance on conjectured hardness of problems such as factoring, discrete logarithms, and noisy linear algebra, which possess significant algebraic structure, introduces vulnerabilities and limits the number of robust problems available for essential cryptographic tasks like key exchange and public-key encryption.\n\nThis proposal seeks to develop a new theoretical foundation for cryptography based on unstructured hardness assumptions derived from Kolmogorov Complexity. By exploring the connection between this measure of randomness and cryptographic security, we aim to overcome structural vulnerabilities and the shortage of candidate problems that currently underpin the security of our cryptographic systems. The project will focus on three core tasks: encryption, authentication, and key exchange, with a particular emphasis on private-key encryption, key-exchange mechanisms, and public-key encryption, which are most susceptible to the limitations of current hardness assumptions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the establishment of a new set of hardness assumptions based on a lack of structural characteristics, thereby offering a more secure foundation for cryptography. We anticipate that this breakthrough will not only fortify the security of the Internet but will also have long-term implications for the reliability and trustworthiness of all systems dependent on cryptographic security. By pioneering a novel approach that connects cryptography with unstructured computational hardness, this project aspires to lay the groundwork for a more resilient digital world."

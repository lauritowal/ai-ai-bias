        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"New sensor devices based on soft chemistry assisted nanostructured functional oxides on Si integrated systems\" (SENSiSOFT), aims to revolutionize the piezoelectric sensor industry, valued in the billion euro range, by producing devices with unprecedented sensitivity and miniaturization. SENSiSOFT seeks to address the critical challenge of bridging the gap between soft-chemistry processes and conventional microfabrication techniques to produce new piezoelectric devices of nanometer size that could significantly enhance wireless mechanical sensors.\n\nAt the core of SENSiSOFTâ€™s innovation are three synergistic strategies: the integration of epitaxial quartz, hollandite, and perovskite oxide thin layers on silicon substrates to achieve high piezoelectric responses; the precise nanostructuration of these oxide thin films into controlled morphologies, including porous structures and one-dimensional nanowires or nanorods; and the fabrication of advanced sensor types, such as nanostructured Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonator-based sensors and LAMB-WAVE multisensors, through cutting-edge MEMs technology and silicon micromachining.\n\nThe proposed use of abundant, cost-effective, and environmentally benign materials like quartz, perovskite, and hollandites, in conjunction with innovative design and fabrication techniques, positions SENSiSOFT to produce sensor devices that are 10 to 100 times more sensitive than current models. These devices will be capable of operating in both 1D and 2D configurations, setting a new standard for sensitivity in the field of piezoelectric sensors.\n\nThe expected outcomes of SENSiSOFT include the establishment of a unified, monolithic process for the chemical integration of functional oxides on silicon substrates, the development of sensors with vastly improved detection thresholds, and the contribution to the metrology demand with sensors that can be integrated into wireless network sensor (WNS) nodes, SAW resonator-based sensors, and LAMB-WAVE multisensors. This project promises to drive innovation and maintain Europe's competitive edge in the global sensor market."

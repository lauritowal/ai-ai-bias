        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Medically Licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\" aims to address the high mortality rate (approximately 40%) and global health burden caused by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Building on the foundation of the ERC Starter Grant HA-NFkB-VILI, this proposal seeks to complete the pre-clinical evaluation of a cryofrozen, medicinally licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) product developed by the Centre for Cell Manufacturing Ireland (CCMI) at NUI Galway, licensed since 2013.\n\nDespite the promise shown by freshly harvested MSCs in multiple in vitro and in vivo lung injury models, the therapeutic potential of cryofrozen CCMI-hMSC remains to be confirmed. The MSC product has been shown to be safe and to retain MSC lineage potency after cryopreservation. However, before it can be administered to patients with ARDS, it is essential to demonstrate its efficacy in several relevant preclinical ARDS models. The proposed research will rigorously test the cryofrozen MSCs in these models, with the goal of replicating the promising therapeutic effects observed with freshly harvested MSCs.\n\nThe project, led by the Irish Critical Care Trials Group, will not only reduce the substantial economic burden associated with ARDS but also has the potential to benefit NUI Galway and the European Union through commercial and medicinal advancements. The successful completion of the pre-clinical evaluation will facilitate the movement of the therapeutic strategy towards Phase I/II clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, this proposal represents a critical step in translating a promising cell therapy from bench to bedside, with the ultimate aim of delivering a novel therapeutic option to ARDS patients and significantly reducing the associated mortality and economic impacts."

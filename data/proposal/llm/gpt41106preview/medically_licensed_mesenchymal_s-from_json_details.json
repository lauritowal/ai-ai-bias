        "Abstract:\n\nThe global health burden of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remains a critical concern, with mortality rates lingering around 40% and hundreds of thousands of annual deaths worldwide. The economic impact of ARDS is substantial, necessitating the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Our project, entitled \"Medically Licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,\" aims to evaluate the efficacy of a cryofrozen, medicinally licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) product developed by the Centre for Cell Manufacturing Ireland (CCMI) at NUI Galway, licensed since 2013.\n\nBuilding on previous research (HA-NFkB-VILI) and leveraging several relevant preclinical ARDS models, this project seeks to complete the pre-clinical evaluation of the cryofrozen CCMI-hMSC product. We will demonstrate its therapeutic potential in vitro and in vivo lung injury models, ensuring the product is safe and retains MSC lineage potency. Our therapeutic approach requires the MSCs to be allogeneically sourced, culture passaged, cryofrozen, transportable, and capable of being thawed near the bedside before administration to patients.\n\nThe Irish Critical Care Trials Group will oversee the transition from pre-clinical success to clinical application, with the aim of facilitating the movement towards Phase I/II clinical trials. The realization of this project's objectives is anticipated to offer both commercial and medicinal benefits, with direct beneficiaries including NUI Galway and the wider EU community. \n\nThe proposal stands on the cusp of a significant breakthrough in ARDS treatment, with the potential to transform the clinical landscape of this high-mortality condition. This grant proposal requests support to confirm the therapeutic potential of CCMI-hMSCs, which have shown immense promise in initial investigations, and to bring a novel cell therapy to the forefront of ARDS management.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Medically Licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe pulmonary condition with a staggering 40% mortality rate, contributing to hundreds of thousands of annual deaths worldwide. The economic burden of this disease is substantial, necessitating therapeutic advancements. This proposal seeks funding for the complete pre-clinical evaluation of a cryofrozen, medicinally licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) product, aiming to demonstrate its efficacy in pre-clinical models and facilitate its progression to Phase I/II clinical trials.\n\nBuilding upon prior research funded by the ERC Starter Grant HA-NFkB-VILI, this project will utilize several relevant preclinical ARDS models to assess the therapeutic potential of MSCs. The product, developed by the licensed producer CCMI at NUI Galway since 2013, has proven safety and retains MSC lineage potency. However, the therapeutic potential of cryofrozen CCMI-hMSCs remains unconfirmed in lung injury models.\n\nThe project, in collaboration with the Irish Critical Care Trials Group, will address this gap by evaluating the cryofrozen CCMI-hMSC product against multiple in vitro and in vivo lung injury models. The cell therapy requirements include allogeneic sourcing, culture passaging, cryopreservation, bedside thawing, and administration to ARDS patients.\n\nThe proposal's purpose is to realize the commercial and medicinal potential of the MSC product, benefiting NUI Galway, the EU, and, most importantly, ARDS patients through improved treatment options. The anticipated outcomes include demonstrating pre-clinical efficacy and establishing a clear path towards clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of reducing ARDS mortality and alleviating its economic impact.\n\nKeywords: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, pre-clinical evaluation, clinical trials, cryofrozen MSC product.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Medically Licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition with a mortality rate hovering around 40%, leading to hundreds of thousands of annual deaths worldwide. The economic impact of ARDS is substantial, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. This proposal seeks to leverage the therapeutic potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to address this critical healthcare challenge. Building upon the ERC Starter Grant HA-NFkB-VILI, our team proposes to complete the pre-clinical evaluation of a cryofrozen, medicinally licensed MSC product developed by the licensed producer, CCMI, at the NUI Galway since 2013.\n\nThe proposed research will demonstrate the efficacy of cryofrozen CCMI-hMSC in several relevant pre-clinical ARDS models, replicating the promising therapeutic effects observed with freshly harvested MSCs. The product, characterized as safe and retaining MSC lineage potency, complies with clinical use requirements, including allogeneic sourcing, culture passaging, and on-site thawing for administration to patients. The Irish Critical Care Trials Group will oversee the translation of pre-clinical results into clinical applications.\n\nOur proposal aims to complete the pre-clinical evaluation of the cryofrozen MSC product, thereby facilitating its progression toward Phase I/II clinical trials. We anticipate that this work will not only confirm the product's therapeutic potential but also unlock commercial and medicinal benefits for NUI Galway and the broader EU community. The project's success will pave the way for a revolutionary treatment option for ARDS patients and establish a foundation for the commercialization of this life-saving therapy.\n\nKeywords: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, pre-clinical evaluation, clinical trials, cell therapy, NUI Galway, EU.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Medically Licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\" aims to address the high mortality rate (approximately 40%) and global health burden caused by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Building on the foundation of the ERC Starter Grant HA-NFkB-VILI, this proposal seeks to complete the pre-clinical evaluation of a cryofrozen, medicinally licensed Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) product developed by the Centre for Cell Manufacturing Ireland (CCMI) at NUI Galway, licensed since 2013.\n\nDespite the promise shown by freshly harvested MSCs in multiple in vitro and in vivo lung injury models, the therapeutic potential of cryofrozen CCMI-hMSC remains to be confirmed. The MSC product has been shown to be safe and to retain MSC lineage potency after cryopreservation. However, before it can be administered to patients with ARDS, it is essential to demonstrate its efficacy in several relevant preclinical ARDS models. The proposed research will rigorously test the cryofrozen MSCs in these models, with the goal of replicating the promising therapeutic effects observed with freshly harvested MSCs.\n\nThe project, led by the Irish Critical Care Trials Group, will not only reduce the substantial economic burden associated with ARDS but also has the potential to benefit NUI Galway and the European Union through commercial and medicinal advancements. The successful completion of the pre-clinical evaluation will facilitate the movement of the therapeutic strategy towards Phase I/II clinical trials.\n\nIn summary, this proposal represents a critical step in translating a promising cell therapy from bench to bedside, with the ultimate aim of delivering a novel therapeutic option to ARDS patients and significantly reducing the associated mortality and economic impacts."

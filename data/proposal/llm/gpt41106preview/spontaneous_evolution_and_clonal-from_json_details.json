        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Spontaneous Evolution and Clonal heterOgeneity in MoNoclonal Gammopathies: from mechanisms of progression to clinical management\n\nThe proposed research, led by an onco-hematologist with significant genomics expertise, aims to revolutionize our understanding of multiple myeloma (MM) by elucidating the role of heterogeneity and evolution in its early stages. Recognizing the limitations of current prognostic scores, which fail to accurately capture the variable frequency of MM evolution, our project hypothesizes that heterogeneity is present early in the disease course, and can be harnessed to predict the MM evolutionary trajectory more effectively.\n\nThe research will perform an innovative analysis of early MM stages, using both retrospective and ambitious prospective sample cohorts, including hundreds of bone marrow samples obtained from hip replacement specimens and thousands of archived peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals with years of annotated clinical follow-up. The methodology combines single-cell genotyping and phenotyping of asymptomatic MMs, characterization of the bone marrow microenvironment, and serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA.\n\nOur integrative approach seeks to identify early genomic alterations that serve as disease biomarkers, dissect the functional heterogeneity within the disease, and determine the biological determinants of disease progression. Modelling of candidate early lesions and modifier screens aim to refine the search for candidate biological markers that can predict the disease's evolution.\n\nExpected outcomes include a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities for the development of rational therapies and the establishment of a new paradigm for molecularly-driven precision medicine in cancer. Ultimately, this research has the potential to shift clinical management towards an era of precision medicine, offering better control over MM progression and improving patient outcomes."

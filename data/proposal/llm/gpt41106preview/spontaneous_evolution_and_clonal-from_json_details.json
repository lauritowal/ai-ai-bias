        "Abstract:\n\nThe grant proposal titled \"Spontaneous Evolution and Clonal heterOgeneity in MoNoclonal Gammopathies: from mechanisms of progression to clinical management\" seeks to revolutionize the understanding and clinical approach to multiple myeloma (MM) by focusing on the disease's early stages. Spearheaded by an onco-hematologist with extensive genomics expertise, the project is designed to unravel the heterogeneity present at the onset of MM and to identify the biological determinants that govern its evolution.\n\nThe hypothesis driving this research is that the heterogeneity in MM, reflected in both genotypic and phenotypic features, manifests early in the disease course and can predict the evolutionary trajectory of MM. The aim is to move beyond current prognostic scores, which fail to accurately capture the variable frequency of evolution, and to establish more refined predictors for the control of disease progression.\n\nThe research will employ a unique combination of retrospective sample cohorts and ambitious prospective sampling, including hundreds of bone marrow samples from hip replacement specimens and thousands of peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals with annotated clinical follow-up. Advanced techniques such as integrated single-cell genotyping and phenotyping of asymptomatic MMs, serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA, and aggressive modelling of candidate early lesions with modifier screens will be used.\n\nThe expected outcomes include the identification of early genomic alterations as biomarkers for clinical screening, a functional dissection of heterogeneity characterizing the bone marrow microenvironment, and the establishment of a list of vulnerabilities that can be targeted for rational therapies. This project has the potential to set a new paradigm for molecularly-driven precision medicine in cancer, offering significant benefits for the clinical management of MM and possibly other monoclonal gammopathies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed study, \"Spontaneous Evolution and Clonal heterOgeneity in MoNoclonal Gammopathies: from mechanisms of progression to clinical management\" (SECHOMON), spearheaded by an onco-hematologist with substantial genomics expertise, aims to elucidate the early heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics in Multiple Myeloma (MM). This research pivots on the hypothesis that clonal heterogeneity is present at the disease's inception and can be leveraged to predict MM progression.\n\nSECHOMON intends to break new ground by focusing on the early, often asymptomatic stages of MM. Through a robust dual approach combining retrospective analysis of extensive sample cohorts and ambitious prospective sampling, the project will analyze bone marrow from hip replacement patients and peripheral blood from a large cohort of healthy individuals with thorough clinical follow-up. Innovative research methodologies, including single-cell genotyping and phenotyping, along with serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA, will dissect the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of MM.\n\nA significant contribution of SECHOMON will be its potential to identify early genomic alterations as biomarkers for clinical screening, characterize the bone marrow microenvironment, and establish correlations with clinical outcomes. The project seeks to uncover the biological determinants of MM evolution by examining the disease's prevalent and asymptomatic stages, thereby addressing the limitations of current prognostic scores.\n\nThe expected outcomes of SECHOMON encompass not only a catalog of candidate biological markers for predicting disease trajectory but also a list of vulnerabilities amenable to rational therapies. Ultimately, this research is poised to set a new paradigm for precision medicine in cancer, offering molecularly-driven strategies that could revolutionize clinical management and outcomes for MM patients. The comprehensive modeling of early lesions and modifier screens will further underpin the development of targeted interventions, aligning with the overarching goal of controlling MM progression through innovation in early detection and individualized treatment strategies.",
        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Spontaneous Evolution and Clonal heterOgeneity in MoNoclonal Gammopathies: from mechanisms of progression to clinical management\"\n\nMultiple myeloma (MM), a cancer characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells, exhibits significant heterogeneity that contributes to disease progression and therapeutic resistance. This heterogeneity is present from early disease stages, impacting the accuracy of current prognostic scores and clinical management. The proposed research by an onco-hematologist with strong genomics expertise seeks to unravel the complex genotypic and phenotypic landscape of MM, particularly focusing on the asymptomatic, early stages of disease.\n\nThe project will utilize retrospective cohorts and ambitious prospective sampling, including hundreds of bone marrow samples from hip replacement surgeries and thousands of peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals with annotated clinical follow-up data. Through integrated single-cell genotyping and phenotyping, along with serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA, this study aims to identify early genomic alterations and characterize the bone marrow microenvironment. These findings are expected to establish biomarkers for clinical screening and correlate with clinical outcomes, shedding light on the biological determinants of MM evolution.\n\nThe methodology includes advanced single-cell analyses and aggressive modeling of candidate early lesions, combined with modifier screens to pinpoint disease vulnerabilities. The outcome of this research will likely yield a comprehensive list of candidate biological markers for predicting MM evolution and inform the development of molecularly-driven precision medicine strategies. By focusing on the spontaneous evolution and clonal heterogeneity in MM, the proposed work promises to shift the paradigm of MM research, leading to improved prediction and control of disease trajectory, and ultimately, to more rationale and personalized therapeutic interventions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Spontaneous Evolution and Clonal heterOgeneity in MoNoclonal Gammopathies: from mechanisms of progression to clinical management\n\nThe proposed research, led by an onco-hematologist with significant genomics expertise, aims to revolutionize our understanding of multiple myeloma (MM) by elucidating the role of heterogeneity and evolution in its early stages. Recognizing the limitations of current prognostic scores, which fail to accurately capture the variable frequency of MM evolution, our project hypothesizes that heterogeneity is present early in the disease course, and can be harnessed to predict the MM evolutionary trajectory more effectively.\n\nThe research will perform an innovative analysis of early MM stages, using both retrospective and ambitious prospective sample cohorts, including hundreds of bone marrow samples obtained from hip replacement specimens and thousands of archived peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals with years of annotated clinical follow-up. The methodology combines single-cell genotyping and phenotyping of asymptomatic MMs, characterization of the bone marrow microenvironment, and serial sampling of circulating cell-free DNA.\n\nOur integrative approach seeks to identify early genomic alterations that serve as disease biomarkers, dissect the functional heterogeneity within the disease, and determine the biological determinants of disease progression. Modelling of candidate early lesions and modifier screens aim to refine the search for candidate biological markers that can predict the disease's evolution.\n\nExpected outcomes include a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities for the development of rational therapies and the establishment of a new paradigm for molecularly-driven precision medicine in cancer. Ultimately, this research has the potential to shift clinical management towards an era of precision medicine, offering better control over MM progression and improving patient outcomes."

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative neuroimaging study aimed at elucidating the neural underpinnings of social interaction and shared understanding. Social cognition is a crucial yet complex aspect of human behavior, involving the intricate task of aligning neural representations of the world between individuals. Traditional neuroscience approaches to social cognition have been limited by the use of overly simplistic stimuli, failing to capture the richness of real-world interactions. With recent advancements in brain signal analysis, this research seeks to overcome these limitations by employing naturalistic settings to investigate the synchronization of brain activity as a marker of shared cognitive processes.\n\nThe project proposes a multi-faceted approach to test the hypothesis that temporal synchronization of brain activity across individuals underlies effective social communication and mutual understanding. Using cutting-edge signal analysis techniques and rapid MRI acquisition, the study aims to determine: i) the role of brain circuit synchronization during social interactions in fostering interpersonal comprehension, ii) the correlation between synchronized brain activity and similarity in cognitive tasks among individuals, and iii) the impact of intense emotional experiences on the synchronization and information flow between brains.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will provide valuable insights into the dynamic brain processes that support social interaction, potentially revolutionizing our approach to studying social and cognitive neuroscience. By integrating principles from social psychology with advanced neuroscientific methods, the proposed model promises to enhance our grasp of the neural mechanisms that allow for shared understanding in the complex fabric of human social life."

Studying how social information is represented similarly across individual brains and how it flows from brain to brain poses huge conceptual and technical challenges for neuroscientists, who have consequently resorted to experiments using simplistic and impoverished social stimuli. However, recent advances in brain signal analysis enable us to study the brain basis of social interaction under naturalistic settings with unparalleled accuracy. This neuroimaging project aims to bridge the gap between social psychology and cognitive neuroscience by building a comprehensive neurocognitive model of how individuals maintain and communicate shared neural representations of the dynamic social world. The framework relies on testing the assumption that similarities in sensory and higher-order processing across individuals can be quantified by measuring temporal synchronization of their brain activity. We use novel signal analysis methods, experimental techniques and rapid magnetic resonance image acquisition for testing i) whether selective synchronization of brain circuits during social interaction supports interpersonal understanding, ii) whether similarities in cognitive task sets across individuals are associated with increasingly synchronous brain activity, and iii) whether intense emotional experiences enhance synchronization of brain responses and flow of information from brain to brain. The results will significantly improve our understanding of the brain dynamics of social interaction, and the proposed naturalistic neuroscience approach and will potentially contribute to a significant paradigm shift in social and cognitive neuroscience.",

Building on earlier demonstration of bioactive hydrogel synthesis and in vitro expansion of iPSCs in 3D cell culture under static conditions, we will synthesize the necessary amount of material for iPSC expansion studies, develop protocols to prepare microcapsules with and without iPSCs where the SQ supramolecular material is within the core or shell, and evaluate the feasibility of the different microcapsules for the culture of iPSCs in bioreactors and their release, ranking the approaches on iPSC number and quality for further downstream application. In parallel with these activities, we will perform detailed market research studies on microfabricated polymer materials being applied for bioreactor culture of various cell types, protecting our intellectual property (IP) position and consolidating our findings in a package for product licensing with the appropriate party."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Do plant volatiles shape species interactions in agroecological fields?\n\nThe PANOPLY project seeks to investigate the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in plant-insect interactions within agroecological systems, with an emphasis on the grapevine (Vitis vinifera) as a model organism. This research aims to address the significant knowledge gap in how VOCs influence the behavior and survival of the leafhopper pest (Scaphoideus titanus) and the spread of the Flavescence dorée (FD) disease, posing a threat to European grapevines.\n\nThrough a multiphase approach from the laboratory to the field, the project will identify key VOCs that impact leafhopper life history traits, validate the effects of these VOCs through greenhouse and common garden experiments, and test aromatic plants in field experiments to determine the long-term role of VOCs in shaping multitrophic interactions. The primary objectives are to elucidate the mechanisms of plant-mediated cues and assess their long-term influence on plant-insect relationships.\n\nPANOPLY is poised to be the first project to demonstrate the influence of VOCs on multitrophic interactions in perennial plant species on a long-term scale in field conditions. Anticipated outcomes include a deeper understanding of chemical ecology and agroecology, enhanced crop health, increased insect biodiversity, and advancements in biological pest control. The project aligns with sustainable agricultural practices by promoting the use of zero-pesticides and offers potential strategies for pest management through the exploitation of naturally occurring VOCs.\n\nThis pioneering research has the potential to open novel research avenues in chemical ecology and agroecology, contributing significantly to the field of plant-insect interactions. The outcomes of PANOPLY will have far-reaching implications for sustainable agriculture and the preservation of agroecosystem health and biodiversity."

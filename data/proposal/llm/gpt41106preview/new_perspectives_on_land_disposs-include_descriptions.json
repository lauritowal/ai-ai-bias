        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to support LANDRESPONSE, an interdisciplinary research project that addresses the critical nexus between land dispossession, violent conflict, and migration among smallholder farmers and pastoralists in the Sahel region, with a particular focus on Mali. The central hypothesis posits that the disenfranchisement of smallholders from their land, exacerbated by rent-seeking elites and ambiguous land rights, contributes to increased propensities for either migration or violent resistance, including the rise of jihadist groups. The project aims to illuminate the complex relationships between land dispossession, elite capture, and the emergence of violent responses against government authorities, as well as migratory movements towards North Africa and Europe.\n\nLANDRESPONSE will deploy mixed methods to explore why certain smallholders opt for violent resistance while others choose compliance or migration. The study will be situated in Mali, a critical hub for both violent insurgencies and migratory flows in the Western Sahel. By integrating political ecology, critical agrarian studies, and peace and conflict studies, the project aspires to produce a nuanced understanding of the motivations and decisions of smallholders facing the loss of their traditional livelihoods.\n\nThe outcomes of this research are expected to advance the academic discourse on land governance, conflict, and migration, and to inform policy development aimed at addressing the underlying issues driving these phenomena. Through a combination of theoretical innovation and empirical research, LANDRESPONSE will contribute valuable insights into the plight of smallholders in the Sahel, fostering a more comprehensive approach to managing the interconnected challenges of land rights, violence, and migration in the region."

The hypothesis of LANDRESPONSE is that smallholders who are dispossessed of access to land are more inclined to either migrate or resist violently. Violent resistance will be studied in this project with regard to the increasing numbers of armed groups labelled ‘jihadist’ in the Sahel and in particular in Mali. The project will investigate the nature of the links between land dispossession and elite capture on the one hand and violent jihadist resistance to governments as well as migration to North Africa and Europe on the other hand. These hypothesized links will be investigated using mixed methods with a particular focus on Mali as a ‘hub’ country in the Western Sahel in terms of both violence and migration. Following this conceptual framework, the objectives directing the project will be – first to investigate whether smallholders in the West African Sahel who are dispossessed of their land and/or fall victim to rent-seeking elites, are more inclined to either resist violently or migrate, and second try to assess why some smallholders are more prone to resist, even violently, while others remain compliant. With its pioneering engagement with these urgent political issues, the project will combine theoretical and empirical approaches from political ecology, critical agrarian studies and peace and conflict studies to generate novel insights about the motivations and agency of smallholders confronted with emerging challenges to their livelihoods. This interdisciplinary research will generate new knowledge on the interactions between land governance, violent conflicts and migration, which will both push the research frontier and provide new ideas for policy formulation.",

        "**Abstract:**\n\nThe proposed research project, 'Law without Mercy,' aims to delve into the overlooked aspect of Japan's military justice system during the Asia-Pacific War (1937-1945). Throughout the war, Japanese military courts operated with an iron fist in East and Southeast Asia, not only to enforce discipline among soldiers but also to exert control over the civilian population and showcase a fa√ßade of legal legitimacy to both domestic and international observers. This study will scrutinize the duality of the justice system which, while claiming legality, often resulted in extreme punishments such as executions and severe incarcerations, thus reflecting the overall brutality of Japan's wartime conduct.\n\nThe study is critical in understanding how legal practices were intertwined with the perpetration and normalization of violence against soldiers, civilians, and enemy combatants. By focusing on military justice as a key instrument for analyzing wartime violence, the project seeks to unravel the complexities of how law and enforcement contributed to the escalation and routinization of aggression in both combat and occupied territories.\n\nThis innovative approach is supported by an extensive investigation of original archival material, which promises to shed new light on the sparsely documented strategies and actions of the Japanese military during the war. The project positions itself at the crossroads of modern Japanese history and international law, leveraging the principal investigator's expertise in both fields to provide comprehensive insights.\n\nAs the contemporary world grapples with the intricate relationship between law, war, and violence, 'Law without Mercy' offers not only a scholarly contribution to historical understanding but also bears relevance to ongoing humanitarian issues. The findings of this research will contribute significantly to the discourse on military justice and its implications for international law and human rights in conflict situations."

Wherever Japanese soldiers went, judge-advocates followed, meeting out stern justice to soldiers, civilians and enemy soldiers alike. The system of courts-martial and military courts throughout East and Southeast Asia served three purposes: regulate violence and channel it efficiently to serve Japan's war goals; deter the civilian population and coerce it into following Japan's 'New Order' in East Asia; and finally, convince domestic and international audiences that Japan's war was not only legitimate, but also 'legal'. Yet, despite formal pretences, verdicts routinely ended in execution or harsh imprisonment. As such, the violence of the justice system mirrored the brutality of the war in general. Despite the highly contentious nature of the war even today, a systematic study of mass violence during the Asia-Pacific War has been sorely lacking. 'Law without Mercy' undertakes this daunting task by using military justice as focal point and as a highly precise lens for studying the various figurations of violence during the war. It is pioneering in analysing legal practice as an integral part of this violence and facilitator for its routinisation and escalation on the battlefield and in the occupied territories. And finally, it opens up a wholly new and large body of sources through original archival work that helps to overcome the notorious direness of documentation on Japan's conduct during the war. Situated at the intersection of several historical fields, 'Law without Mercy' capitalises on the double expertise of the PI in modern Japanese history and international law. With the complex and precarious relation between law, war and violence still at the heart of humanitarian issues, the historical insights of this project have very practical implications for our conflict-laden world today.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The Cultural Evolution and Ecology of Institutions: An Integrated Evolutionary Approach to the Interrelated Rules that Regulate Human Social Organization and Cooperation,\" aims to deepen our understanding of the cultural evolution of institutions that underpin human societies. Institutions, defined as culturally inherited social rules, enable large groups of genetically unrelated individuals to solve coordination and collective action problems. This research intends to dissect the complex evolutionary pathways of these social constructs, their diffusion patterns, and the ecological and cultural factors that limit their prevalence.\n\nEmploying a cultural evolutionary framework, the project will test hypotheses related to the evolution and distribution of institutions using a multidisciplinary approach. Three primary objectives guide this investigation: (1) to infer the evolutionary history of institutions through phylogenetic methods, (2) to analyze the determinants influencing the spread of institutions between societies using epidemiological and comparative statistical models, and (3) to scrutinize the ecological and social factors that have precipitated the emergence of institutions for collective action via computer simulations.\n\nThe methods encompass statistical, computational, and theoretical models borrowed from biology, providing a robust platform for evaluating hypotheses. Data sources will include comprehensive cross-national and historical data on institutions, offering a rich basis for empirical assessment. By modeling and empirically assessing the interplay between institutions and their cultural and ecological contexts, the project aims to yield an improved understanding of institutional change and provide insights into the evolutionary and ecological processes that have shaped human societies.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project are to offer a groundbreaking perspective on the evolution of institutions, elucidate the cultural and ecological impacts on these social structures, and explain their geographical distribution. The knowledge generated will contribute significantly to the field of social science, offering a novel integrated evolutionary perspective on the governance and organization of human groups."

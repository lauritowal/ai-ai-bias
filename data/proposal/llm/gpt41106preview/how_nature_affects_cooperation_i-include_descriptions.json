        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an interdisciplinary project, NATCOOP, that seeks to unravel the complex interactions between natural systems and human economic behavior, with a focus on the sustainable management of common-pool resources (CPRs). Recognizing that nature's constraints and dynamics significantly influence economic fundamentals, this research aims to establish how the natural environment shapes the preferences and incentives of economic agents, and how this relationship feeds back into CPR management.\n\nAt the heart of NATCOOP are three investigative mechanisms: (A) examining whether tipping points in natural systems can promote cooperative behavior; (B) exploring how fluctuations in resource availability affect risk preferences and community-based management; and (C) analyzing the interplay between leadership, risk preferences, and environmental conditions in fostering cooperation to resolve common-pool dilemmas. These areas have been largely neglected in traditional approaches that consider preferences and incentives as static.\n\nThe project's ambitious agenda will pioneer new ground in economics and sustainability science by providing a novel perspective on the nexus between nature and cooperation. The research will encompass diverse socio-economic and ecological settings across three continents, integrating theoretical and statistical methodologies to create a comprehensive body of knowledge.\n\nLed by a researcher with a strong foundation in both economics and ecology, NATCOOP is poised to elucidate the conditions under which natural and social factors synergize to enhance the sustainable use of renewable resources. The project's success will not only advance scientific understanding but also inform policy frameworks to better manage CPRs, particularly in developing countries where they are crucial for livelihoods. The researcher's deep commitment to this cause, combined with a broad and innovative approach, sets the stage for potentially transformative outcomes in the field of resource sustainability."

This can be taken into account to formulate effective policies. However, the causal pathway from the natural to the social environment and its feedback for sustainable resource use is often overlooked, not the least because preferences and incentives are traditionally viewed as being stable and fixed. Yet, it is high time to take this new perspective: Social-ecological systems around the globe are under mounting stress and common pool resources are vital, in particular in developing countries. This project aims to establish how nature shapes preferences and incentives of economic agents and how this in turn affects common-pool resource management. To this end, I investigate three mechanisms: (A) how tipping points and thresholds in the natural system may encourage cooperation; (B) how the volatility of resource abundance influences risk preferences and how this in turn affects community-based management; and (C) how leadership, which is closely linked to risk preferences, interacts with the natural environment to foster cooperation that overcomes common-pool dilemmas. NATCOOP's bold agenda pushes the frontier of economics and sustainability science. Not only the investigation of the feedbacks between nature and cooperation from a new angle, also the scale and scope of the project -- combining cases from different socio-economic and ecological setting at three continents with theoretical and statistical work -- will generate new knowledge and be highly rewarding. Though challenging, I am confident that my background in economics and ecology puts me in an ideal position to achieve this important task. My ultimate goal is to identify circumstances in which natural preconditions and the social setting may go hand in hand to promote the sustainable use of renewable resources.",

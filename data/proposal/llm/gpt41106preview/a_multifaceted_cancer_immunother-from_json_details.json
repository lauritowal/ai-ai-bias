        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A multifaceted cancer immunotherapy based on an immune checkpoint-modulating chimeric oncolytic virus vector in combination with a dendritic cell vaccine.\n\nCancer remains a significant health concern with profound epidemiological and financial societal burdens. Despite the emergence of innovative treatments, the response to current therapies for solid tumors, such as Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has been disappointing, primarily due to the immune-suppressive microenvironment characteristic of the liver. This grant proposal outlines a novel approach in the research field of cancer immunotherapy that harnesses the patient's immune system to combat HCC.\n\nOur proposed strategy, ONCO-VAX, is a combination therapy that integrates a novel chimeric oncolytic virus (OV) with a dendritic cell vaccine. The OV is engineered for enhanced cell-cell spreading capacity and optimized gene expression aimed at eradicating the local immune-suppressive microenvironment within the tumor. Oncolytic viruses as monotherapy have demonstrated limitations due to the innate antiviral immune response, which we plan to overcome with this synergistic approach.\n\nThe dendritic cell vaccine serves as an additional layer of therapy to initiate a broad antitumor response. Our goal is to trigger systemic and potentially life-long immunity against cancer. ONCO-VAX is positioned to be an innovative step in cancer immuno-oncology by exploiting the immune-stimulatory capacity of the virus and improving OV intratumoral dissemination.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include synergistic responses for metastatic HCC, characterized by improved therapeutic efficacy and long-term disease remission. The proposed project will not only fill a critical gap in current treatment modalities but also potentially revolutionize the management of HCC by providing a robust, durable, and systemic antitumor response.\n\nKeywords: cancer immunotherapy, Hepatocellular carcinoma, oncolytic viruses, dendritic cell vaccine, combination therapy, immune-suppressive microenvironment."

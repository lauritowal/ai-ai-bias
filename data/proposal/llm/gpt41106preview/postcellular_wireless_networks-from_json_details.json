        "Abstract:\n\nThe surge in wireless traffic, driven by the proliferation of smartphones, the expansion of cloud computing, and the rise of machine-to-machine communication, is pushing the limits of current cellular networks. The \"Post-Cellular Wireless Networks\" (POSTCELL) project seeks to lay the groundwork for the next generation of wireless networks—a transformation into the post-cellular era. This paradigm shift involves moving beyond the traditional cell-centric approach to a novel network architecture that can accommodate the staggering increase in traffic volume and the need for network massification.\n\nPOSTCELL's primary objectives include defining a new network architecture and characterizing its performance to support the anticipated massification process. This entails devising strategies for network densification, such as creating a vision of tiny and exceedingly abundant base stations, and scaling up the number of colocated antennas—potentially hundreds per base station. These approaches are expected to coexist, offering a composite solution to the massification challenge.\n\nA key component of POSTCELL is the introduction of new architectural features, such as dynamically defined virtual base stations, powerful caches, and device clustering, which are essential to managing the complex, high-volume traffic environment. Additionally, the project will undertake a fundamental shift in signal processing, moving away from traditional base stations towards new, innovative locations, which will also involve a deconstruction of current base stations.\n\nThe far-reaching implications of POSTCELL will not only drive the transformation of wireless networks but will also establish a robust framework for gauging the performance of post-cellular wireless networks. Through its comprehensive approach, POSTCELL is poised to address the critical challenges faced by today's wireless communications industry and to support the continued growth and evolution of wireless technology in the future.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Post-Cellular Wireless Networks\" (POSTCELL) seeks to lay the groundwork for the next generations of wireless networks by initiating a transformative shift into the post-cellular era. This cutting-edge research aims to redefine the existing wireless network architecture, characterize its performance, and understand the far-reaching implications of this revolution for wireless communications.\n\nThe exponential growth in wireless traffic, driven by the ubiquity of smartphones, the expansion of cloud computing, and the rise of machine-to-machine communication, has led to an anticipated staggering increase in traffic volume. POSTCELL confronts the challenge of network massification head-on by proposing a dual strategy of densification and antenna scaling. This strategy envisions not just the deployment of tiny and exceedingly abundant base stations, but also the scaling up of colocated antennas per base station to unprecedented numbers, ensuring the coexistence of both massification forms.\n\nPOSTCELL will define a new network architecture featuring dynamically defined virtual base stations, powerful caches, and innovative device clustering. In parallel, the project will usher in a significant signal processing transformation, moving away from traditional base stations and towards new, more efficient processing locations.\n\nThe deconstruction of base stations and the careful gauging of performance are central to POSTCELL's goal to drive the transformation of wireless networks. By harnessing these new architecture features, POSTCELL anticipates addressing the burgeoning needs of wireless communications in terms of capacity, coverage, and quality of service.\n\nFunded research under POSTCELL will not only redefine how wireless networks operate but will also have substantial implications for industry standards, end-user experiences, and future technological innovations. The project's outcomes are poised to influence a broad range of applications, from personal communications to the Internet of Things (IoT), setting the stage for a truly connected world in the post-cellular era.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe accelerating demand for wireless communication, driven by the proliferation of smartphones, advancements in cloud computing, and the expansion of machine-to-machine communication, is pushing the limits of current cellular network capabilities. In response, the POSTCELL initiative proposes a transformative step towards the \"Post-Cellular Wireless Networks\" project, a forward-thinking exploration designed to lay the groundwork for future generations of wireless networks. The project aims to redefine wireless network architecture by moving beyond the conventional cell-centric paradigm and addressing the anticipated staggering growth in traffic volumes.\n\nPOSTCELL will pursue a comprehensive strategy encompassing the massification of networks through two coexisting forms: densification, which envisions the deployment of tiny yet exceedingly abundant base stations, and scaling, which involves increasing the number of colocated antennas per base station to unprecedented levels. This dual approach to network massification is expected to yield dramatic improvements in wireless network performance.\n\nThe project will also focus on the deconstruction of traditional base station roles and the shift in signal processing to new, dynamically defined virtual base stations, complemented by powerful caching systems and strategic device clustering. These innovative architecture features are essential to meet the new requirements of post-cellular network operation, which includes the ability to manage vast amounts of data and provide seamless connectivity.\n\nBy characterizing the performance and defining the architecture of post-cellular networks, POSTCELL aims to drive a paradigm shift in wireless communications. The far-reaching implications of this transformation will not only enhance current network capacities but also enable the support of an ever-growing ecosystem of connected devices and services. Through its comprehensive research and development efforts, POSTCELL will gauge the performance of post-cellular wireless networks, ensuring that the infrastructure is robust, efficient, and ready to meet the demands of future generations.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Post-Cellular Wireless Networks (POSTCELL)\n\nThe POSTCELL project is a visionary initiative aimed at establishing the foundation for the next generations of wireless networks, propelling us into the post-cellular era. This transformational project seeks to redefine the architecture of wireless networks to cope with the staggering growth in wireless traffic driven by the proliferation of smartphones, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine communication. POSTCELL envisions a paradigm shift where the traditional cell-centric approach gives way to a post-cellular framework characterized by the coexistence of network massification strategies.\n\nThe primary objectives of POSTCELL are to define a new network architecture and to rigorously characterize its performance. The project proposes a dual strategy of network densification, involving the deployment of tiny and abundant base stations, and the scaling of antennas, where hundreds of colocated antennas per base station are anticipated. The novel architecture will feature dynamically defined virtual base stations, powerful caches, and device clustering. Moreover, a substantial shift in signal processing is expected, moving away from conventional base stations to novel and innovative locations within the network.\n\nPOSTCELL aims to address the anticipated traffic volume increase by exploring the coexistence of both massification forms, leading to the deconstruction of traditional base stations. This approach is not merely an incremental improvement but a complete transformation that will drive the performance gauge of wireless networks into uncharted territories. The project's far-reaching implications will significantly impact wireless communications, providing a robust and scalable solution to meet the future demands of an ever-connected society.\n\nIn conclusion, POSTCELL is poised to drive the transformation towards a post-cellular wireless network landscape, defining new architectural requirements, and achieving a fundamental shift in signal processing.

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Post-Cellular Wireless Networks (POSTCELL)\n\nThe POSTCELL project is a visionary initiative aimed at establishing the foundation for the next generations of wireless networks, propelling us into the post-cellular era. This transformational project seeks to redefine the architecture of wireless networks to cope with the staggering growth in wireless traffic driven by the proliferation of smartphones, cloud computing, and machine-to-machine communication. POSTCELL envisions a paradigm shift where the traditional cell-centric approach gives way to a post-cellular framework characterized by the coexistence of network massification strategies.\n\nThe primary objectives of POSTCELL are to define a new network architecture and to rigorously characterize its performance. The project proposes a dual strategy of network densification, involving the deployment of tiny and abundant base stations, and the scaling of antennas, where hundreds of colocated antennas per base station are anticipated. The novel architecture will feature dynamically defined virtual base stations, powerful caches, and device clustering. Moreover, a substantial shift in signal processing is expected, moving away from conventional base stations to novel and innovative locations within the network.\n\nPOSTCELL aims to address the anticipated traffic volume increase by exploring the coexistence of both massification forms, leading to the deconstruction of traditional base stations. This approach is not merely an incremental improvement but a complete transformation that will drive the performance gauge of wireless networks into uncharted territories. The project's far-reaching implications will significantly impact wireless communications, providing a robust and scalable solution to meet the future demands of an ever-connected society.\n\nIn conclusion, POSTCELL is poised to drive the transformation towards a post-cellular wireless network landscape, defining new architectural requirements, and achieving a fundamental shift in signal processing. The project's success will lay the groundwork for the sustainable and efficient growth of wireless networks, setting the stage for an unprecedented level of connectivity in our digital society."

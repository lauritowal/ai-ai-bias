        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Deep Brain Neuromodulation using Temporal Interference Magnetic Stimulation\" (TIMS), aims to address critical limitations in current treatments for debilitating brain diseases such as stroke, depression, and dementia. These limitations include inadequate spatial resolution, specificity, and the inability to non-invasively reach deep brain areas. Our goal is to develop a proof-of-concept for a revolutionary non-invasive brain modulation tool that can achieve millimeter- and millisecond-precision in modulating neural activity, impacting both superficial and deep brain areas.\n\nThe innovative technology at the heart of this project leverages temporal interference, where high carrier frequency magnetic fields are emitted through a pair of coils. By modulating the relative phase of these coils, a locally amplitude-modulated electric field is induced in the brain. This field selectively stimulates neural tissues that are responsive to low-frequency amplitude-modulated fields, while remaining insensitive to the unmodulated high frequencies (>1kHz).\n\nOur research will focus on demonstrating the cell-type specificity of TIMS, and the feasibility of achieving precise millisecond targeting. The anticipated device will offer high spatial resolution, depth selectivity, steerability, and closed-loop compatibility. Its cell-type specificity will represent a significant advancement over current neuromodulation techniques.\n\nThe project will benefit from strategic collaborations with two industry partners and one technology transfer partner, ensuring that our research is swiftly translated into innovative products. We envision that TIMS will significantly advance therapeutic strategies for brain-related diseases, improving the quality of life for patients and reducing the societal burden of these conditions."

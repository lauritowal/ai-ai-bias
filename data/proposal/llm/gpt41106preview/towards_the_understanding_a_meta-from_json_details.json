        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Towards the Understanding of Metal-Tumour-Metabolism,\" aims to elucidate the complex interplay between metal ions, metallothioneins, and tumour cell metabolism, which is pivotal for advancing cancer treatment strategies. This research intends to dissect the mechanisms through which tumour cells manage essential metal ions and deal with the effects of platinum-based anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. By revealing the biochemical and molecular-biological relationships between metal ions and proteins in tumour development, this study strives to uncover new carcinogenetic pathways, pinpointing potential targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\nThe investigative approach encompasses a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, employing sophisticated electrochemical, mass spectrometric, and immune-based methods to monitor metallothionein interactions with metals and drugs. Genetic modifications of target genes will be conducted to establish causative links between observed phenomena and tumour growth. Crucial to this endeavour are the experimental models employed, including mice bearing breast tumours (MCF-7 and 4T1) and MeLiM minipigs with melanomas, which will provide insights into the relevance of the findings for mammalian physiology.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include a precise description of the tumour-related pathways managing metal ions, suppression of tumour growth and development, and enhancement of treatment effectiveness. This project promises to guide the development of novel, highly effective treatment strategies and improve the overall understanding of cancer formation and development. The insights from this research could lead to breakthroughs in overcoming multi-drug resistance and treatment failures, significantly impacting patient care and survival outcomes. This proposal, thus, presents a compelling case for funding support to drive transformative advancements in oncology.\n\nKeywords: Metal-Tumour-Metabolism, metallothioneins, cancer, platinum-based drugs, carcinogenetic pathways, treatment resistance."

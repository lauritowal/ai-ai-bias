        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Ancient Adhesives - A window on prehistoric technological complexity\" aims to address a significant gap in our understanding of cognitive evolution: the ability to infer cognitively complex behavior in the deep past from archaeological finds. The focus is on the use of adhesives—a reflection of behavioural and cognitive complexity in Neandertals and modern humans—considered to be among the oldest examples of sophisticated technology. This project endeavors to create the first reliable method for comparing the technological complexity of adhesives used by Neandertals and modern humans.\n\nDespite the importance of technological artifacts in demonstrating cognitive capacities, there is currently no agreed-upon method to measure their complexity. The proposed research will integrate ethnographic records, archaeological evidence, experimental analyses of material properties, and industrial process modelling to develop a novel archaeological methodology. The main objectives include collating comprehensive knowledge on ancient adhesives, developing a new methodology to evaluate their complexity, and applying explicit measures of complexity to assess technological evolution through time and across species.\n\nExpected outcomes are threefold: to establish a measure of technological complexity, to identify unique behavioral traits, and to track the development and disappearance of complex technological skills. The impact of this research is profound, promising to revolutionize our understanding of behavioural complexity and the cognitive distinctions and similarities between Neanderthal and modern human species. Through this innovative approach, the project will provide a significant step-change in debates regarding the evolution of human cognition and technological capability."

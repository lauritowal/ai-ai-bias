        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Deciphering the Role of Huntingtin in Energy Supply for Axonal Transport in Health and Huntington’s Disease\" aims to illuminate the critical role of huntingtin (HTT) in regulating the energy supply required for the fast axonal transport (FAT) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an essential process for maintaining brain function. Despite its significance, the regulation of BDNF transport by neuronal activity, the specific energy sources for FAT, and the mechanisms by which these processes are impaired in Huntington's disease (HD) remain poorly understood.\n\nOur research hypothesizes that HTT is a pivotal factor in channeling energy to molecular motors for effective axonal transport, linking energy production to consumption. Moreover, we propose that the functional alteration of HTT in HD is a key determinant in disease progression. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) Investigate the energy sources for axonal transport and their regulation by HTT in response to heightened neuronal activity; 2) Explore how pathogenic mutations in HTT influence energy production and the vesicles' capacity for energy generation in response to neuronal activity; and 3) Attempt to restore energy sources in HD models to rescue axonal transport and decelerate neurodegeneration.\n\nThis study promises to significantly advance our understanding of how brain function modulates energy metabolism for transport, particularly the transport of BDNF. It will also shed light on the normal and dysfunctional roles of HTT, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for HD. The feasibility of this project is supported by our team's expertise in developing innovative microfluidic circuits for studying axonal transport in reconstituted neuronal circuits, identifying new metabolic and signaling pathways, and a solid background in HTT biology. This work stands to make a substantial impact on the field of neurodegenerative disease research."

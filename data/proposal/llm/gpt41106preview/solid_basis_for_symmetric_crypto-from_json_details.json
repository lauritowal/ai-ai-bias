        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Solid Basis for Symmetric Cryptography\" (SoBaSyC) project aims to revolutionize the field of symmetric cryptography by addressing its fundamental challenges and streamlining the evaluation of cryptographic functions for security and performance. Since standardization efforts began in 1997, the community has seen significant engagement in proposing cryptographic constructions and assessing their robustness. However, persistent issues such as primitives being compromised by known techniques and published cryptanalysis riddled with mistakes or inefficiencies underscore the need for a more rigorous foundation.\n\nSoBaSyC proposes an innovative approach that begins with a comprehensive analysis of cryptanalysis as the cornerstone for enhancing security. The project will focus on unifying knowledge across different families of attacks and transforming this knowledge into an algorithmic framework aimed at optimizing cryptographic algorithms. The project's approach includes creating a toolbox of optimized algorithms that are resistant to the best-known attacks and easy to apply, thus saving time for practitioners and researchers in the field.\n\nThe theoretical component of SoBaSyC entails establishing theoretical bounds and incorporating these properties into robust security proofs for symmetric constructions. The deliverables include a suite of security enhancements that ensure resistance to all known attacks for newly proposed primitives, paving the way for more meaningful and realistic security arguments.\n\nThe expected outcomes of SoBaSyC are multifold: the creation of a cryptographic toolbox that encompasses optimized algorithms, the assurance of resistance against known attacks for new proposals, and an overall increase in confidence in symmetric cryptographic functions. By providing a solid basis for symmetric cryptography, SoBaSyC is poised to advance the field on solid ground, fostering trust and reliability in secure communications worldwide."

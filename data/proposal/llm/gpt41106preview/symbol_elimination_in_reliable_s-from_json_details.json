        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Symbol Elimination in Reliable System Engineering\" (SYMELS)\n\nThe SYMELS project is at the vanguard of advancing formal automated reasoning within the ICT industry, targeting the pervasive challenge of software errors and their costly implications. This ambitious project seeks to answer critical questions in the realm of automated reasoning and its application to large-scale codebases, with the goal of integrating the symbol elimination method into the realm of ICT to prevent errors and enhance reliability.\n\nAt the heart of SYMELS is a novel innovation: the automatic generation and proof of first-order properties of software, aimed at precluding errors during software modifications—a vital concern for evolving software systems. Our initial results are promising, showcasing a success rate of over 80% in test cases that manipulate computer memory. This high degree of accuracy emulates the level of proof traditionally achieved through extensive, expensive human work, heralding a new era of efficiency in software engineering.\n\nSYMELS distinguishes itself from other methods in its unique approach to reasoning, utilizing full first-order logic to analyze program properties, a feature unmatched by other existing methods. This increased accuracy and expressiveness are critical, as they allow for more nuanced and comprehensive assessments of software behavior, thus ensuring higher reliability and fostering greater user trust in software technologies.\n\nThe proposed proof of concept is a tool-supported methodology designed to bolster software functionality and reliability continually. SYMELS aims to set a new industry standard where the symbol elimination method is not just an academic exercise but a practical, marketable solution to a ubiquitous industry problem.\n\nThis project represents a transformative step in reliable system engineering, promising significant benefits such as increased software reliability and enhanced user trust—a leap forward in the ICT industry's ability to manage and mitigate the risks associated with software evolution.\n\nKeywords: Symbol Elimination, Automated Reasoning, Software Reliability, ICT Market, Formal Methods."

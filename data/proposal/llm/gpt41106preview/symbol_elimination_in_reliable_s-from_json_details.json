        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Symbol Elimination in Reliable System Engineering\" (SYMELS) project is poised to revolutionize the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) market by offering a groundbreaking approach to software reliability. This project seeks to leverage formal automated reasoning to preempt software errors, thus significantly enhancing system dependability. The central aim is to address critical questions in automated reasoning and to adapt these methods for application within large-scale code bases.\n\nSYMELS introduces an innovative process for the automatic generation and proof of first-order properties of software, thereby mitigating the risk of errors during software modifications. This approach is especially pertinent in contexts requiring the manipulation of computer memory, where initial results have demonstrated a success rate of over 80%. This level of success is particularly notable when compared to traditional methods, where similar proofs have necessitated highly costly human intervention.\n\nThe project's novel methodology, SYMELS, stands out by allowing reasoning about program properties in full first-order logic, a feature unmatched by other existing methods. Its accuracy and expressiveness in method comparison studies underscore its potential to bring about a transformative change in the ICT industry. The proof of concept for SYMELS illustrates a tool-supported methodology that not only allows for continuous growth in software functionality but also promises an increase in software reliability and enhanced user trust in software technologies.\n\nBy targeting the ICT industry with a methodology that has been proven to be superior in both accuracy and expressiveness, SYMELS is set to offer significant benefits, including heightened software reliability and trust among users. This project represents an innovative step forward in the application of automated reasoning to the realm of system engineering, with the potential to set new standards in software development and maintenance.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Symbol Elimination in Reliable System Engineering (SYMELS)\n\nThe SYMELS project represents a pioneering initiative in the field of formal automated reasoning, targeting the improvement of software reliability within the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) market. The central objective of this project is to address critical questions in automated reasoning and to integrate these advances into the analysis and development of large-scale code bases. With an innovative approach to automatically generate and prove first-order properties of software, SYMELS aims to substantially mitigate the risks of errors during software evolution, thereby enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of software systems.\n\nThe inception of SYMELS has already yielded promising results, with initial tests demonstrating a success rate of over 80% in verifying the expected behavior of programs, especially those manipulating computer memory. This level of success is particularly notable considering that similar proofs have historically required intensive and costly human labor. Our unique methodology relies on symbol elimination, a technique not matched by any other method in terms of accuracy and expressiveness when reasoning about full first-order logic properties.\n\nSYMELS stands out as a proof of concept for a tool-supported methodology that enables continual enhancement of software functionality and reliability. By advancing the symbol elimination method and making it accessible to the ICT market, SYMELS promises to offer significant benefits including increased software reliability and heightened user confidence in software technologies.\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding to further develop the SYMELS methodology, refine its tool support, and extensively validate its effectiveness across diverse application domains within the ICT industry. The anticipated outcome is a substantial leap forward in the field of automated reasoning, with profound implications for the quality and dependability of future software engineering endeavors.",

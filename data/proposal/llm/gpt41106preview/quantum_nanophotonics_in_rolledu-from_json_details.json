        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: QUAntum nanophotonics in Rolled-Up Metamaterials (aQUARiUM)\n\nThe aQUARiUM project endeavors to revolutionize the field of quantum nanophotonics by harnessing the unique properties of rolled-up epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials. Our primary goal is to meticulously control and significantly enhance the interaction between photons and nanostructures. This advancement holds promise for the future well-being, economic growth, and security of Europe through the development of a new photonic platform.\n\nOur innovative approach focuses on integrating quantum emitters with rolled-up waveguides to form ENZ metamaterials, providing unprecedented electromagnetic design freedom. This integration is poised to overcome existing challenges such as weak interaction under ambient conditions, control difficulties, and a poor understanding of quantum phenomena at the nanometer scale. The project's objectives are twofold: firstly, to enhance light-matter interactions with single emitters regardless of their position (Enhance), and secondly, to enable collective excitations in dense emitter ensembles, thereby coherently connecting emitters on nanophotonic devices for coherent emission (Collect).\n\nThe aQUARiUM project will employ advanced technologies and methodologies, including quantum physics, photonic devices, and the integration of quantum emitters with rolled-up waveguides. The use of ENZ metamaterials is pivotal in our strategy to address photon absorption, emission, propagation, and storage.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include the creation of novel light sources and the generation of long-term entanglement. These advancements will culminate in a versatile photonic platform with applications across diverse areas, setting a new benchmark in the field of quantum nanophotonics. The project promises to establish a foundation for future innovations while addressing fundamental scientific questions, propelling Europe to the forefront of quantum technology research."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"QUAntum nanophotonics in Rolled-Up Metamaterials\" (aQUARiUM), aims to revolutionize the field of quantum nanophotonics by harnessing the unique properties of rolled-up nanostructures and epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials. This innovative research project is poised to address the critical challenges in photon absorption, emission, propagation, and storage, by significantly enhancing the interaction between light and matter at the nanoscale.\n\nThe objectives of aQUARiUM are twofold: First, to enhance light-matter interactions with single quantum emitters irrespective of their position, and second, to enable collective excitations in dense emitter ensembles. These objectives will be realized through the integration of quantum emitters with rolled-up waveguides tailored as ENZ metamaterials. This approach provides unprecedented electromagnetic design freedom within the ENZ medium, facilitating the exploration of new quantum phenomena.\n\nAddressing the weak interaction that currently plagues nanophotonic devices under ambient conditions, aQUARiUM will leverage quantum physics and advanced photonic device technology to create novel light sources and generate long-term entanglement. The project underscores the importance of this research in contributing to the future well-being, economic growth, and security of Europe.\n\nThe expected outcome is the development of a new photonic platform that stands to impact a broad spectrum of applications. By overcoming the control difficulties and poor understanding of quantum interactions at the nanometer scale, aQUARiUM sets the stage for breakthroughs in creating practical, scalable, and efficient quantum nanophotonic devices.

        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'QUAntum nanophotonics in Rolled-Up Metamaterials' (aQUARiUM) project represents a transformative approach to manipulate light at the quantum scale, with profound implications for the future well-being, economic growth, and security of Europe. The aQUARiUM project endeavors to fundamentally control and enhance the interaction between photons and nanostructures through the development of rolled-up epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials, creating a groundbreaking photonic platform.\n\nOur principal aims are to govern photon absorption, emission, propagation, and storage by integrating quantum emitters with nanophotonic devices. We will achieve this by leveraging the unique electromagnetic properties of ENZ materials to enhance the weak interactions between light and matter that are typical under ambient conditions. Two core objectives drive our research: (i) Enhancing light-matter interactions with single emitters to achieve position-independent control, and (ii) Enabling collective excitations in dense emitter ensembles to coherently connect emitters, allowing for coherent emission.\n\nThe aQUARiUM project will address current challenges in quantum nanophotonics, such as the difficulty of control and the poor understanding of quantum phenomena at the nanometer scale. By exploring the design freedom afforded by ENZ media, we will integrate quantum emitters with rolled-up waveguides to forge novel light-sources and generate long-term entanglement. The expected outcomes include a new photonic platform that can be applied across diverse areas, including secure communication, quantum computing, and sensing technologies.\n\nThrough a synergy of quantum physics and advanced photonic devices, the aQUARiUM project will deliver significant advancements in the field of quantum nanophotonics, positioning Europe at the forefront of this cutting-edge domain.",

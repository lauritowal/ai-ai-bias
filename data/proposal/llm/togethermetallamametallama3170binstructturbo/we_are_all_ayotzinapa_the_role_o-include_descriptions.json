        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project explores the intersection of digital media and transnational memories of disappearance, focusing on the 2014 disappearance of 43 students in Mexico as a pivotal case study. The investigation adopts a dual approach, combining theoretical and multidisciplinary frameworks to examine the role of digital media in shaping collective memories of disappearance. On a theoretical level, the project conceptualizes disappearance as a unique crime that blurs the boundaries between life, death, past, present, and materiality, giving rise to novel forms of digital memory. \n\nThrough a comparative analysis of Mexico, Argentina, and Spain, the project situates the Mexican case within a broader transnational history of disappearance, examining how digital technologies and social networks facilitate the development of mnemonic objects and social movements with global scope. The study will investigate the performative and artistic representations of disappearance in these countries, including literature, exhibitions, and films, to construct a theoretical model for analyzing digital memory in the context of networked social movements. By examining the interplay between digital media, memory, and social movements, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics shaping transnational memories of disappearance."

It investigates a novel case that is in process of shaping: the disappearance of 43 students in Mexico in September 2014. The role of the new media in getting citizens’ attention and in marking a “turning point” was crucial to the upsurge of a counter-movement against the Mexican government and qualifies the event as significant for the transnational arena. The groundbreaking aspect of the project consists in proposing a double approach: a) a theoretical approach in which “disappearance” is considered as a particular crime that becomes a model for analyzing digital memory. Disappearance is a technology that produces a subject with a new ontological status: the disappeared are non-beings, because they are neither alive nor dead. This ontological status transgresses the clear boundaries separating life and death, past, present and future, materiality and immateriality, personal and collective spheres. “Digital memory”, i.e. a memory mediated by digital technology, is also determined by the transgression of the boundaries of given categories b) a multidisciplinary approach situating Mexico´s case in a long transnational history of disappearance in the Hispanic World, including Argentina and Spain. This longer history seeks to compare disappearance as a mnemonic object developed in the global sphere –in social network sites as blogs, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube– in Mexico and the social performances and artistic representations –literature, photo exhibitions, and films– developed in Spain and Argentina. The Mexican case represents a paradigm for the redefinition of the relationship between media and memory. The main output of the project will consist in constructing a theoretical model for analyzing digital mnemonic objects in the rise of networked social movements with a transnational scope.",

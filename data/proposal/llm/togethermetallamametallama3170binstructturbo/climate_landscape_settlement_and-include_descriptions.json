        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal supports an interdisciplinary research project that combines archaeological data science with climate simulations to investigate the complex relationships between climate change, societal development, and resilience in the Fertile Crescent over the past 8000 years. By integrating archaeological settlement data, archaeobotanical data, and General Circulation Model-derived climate simulations, we will create a comprehensive dataset covering 600,000km2 and spanning from 8000BP to 2000BP. This innovative approach will enable us to analyze the interplay between environmental factors, settlement patterns, and subsistence strategies at an unprecedented scale, facilitating a nuanced understanding of how societies have adapted to and responded to climate fluctuations. The project aims to address a critical question: What factors have contributed to the varying degrees of persistence and resilience among societies in the face of changing climatic and environmental conditions? By leveraging the long-term perspective offered by archaeology, this project will provide novel insights into the sustainability of societies and shed light on the complex dynamics driving social and environmental change."

Climate fluctuations are generally considered to be a significant factor in these changes because in pre-industrial societies they directly relate to food production and security. In the short term, ‘collapse’ events brought about by extreme weather changes such as droughts have been blamed for declines in population, social complexity and political systems. More broadly, the relationships between environment, settlement and surplus drive most models for the development of urbanism and hierarchical political systems. Studies seeking to correlate social and climatic changes in the past tend either to focus on highly localised analyses of specific sites and surveys or to take a more synthetic overview at much larger, even continental, scales. The CLaSS project will take a ground breaking hybrid approach using archaeological data science (or ‘big data’) to construct detailed, empirical datasets at unprecedented scales. Archaeological settlement data and archaeobotanical data (plant and tree remains) will be collated for the entire Fertile Crescent and combined with climate simulations derived from General Circulation Models using cutting edge techniques. The resulting datasets will represent the largest of their kind ever compiled, covering the period between 8000BP and 2000BP and an area of 600,000km2. Collecting data at this scale will enable us to compare population densities and distribution, subsistence practices and landscape management strategies to investigate the question: What factors have allowed for the differential persistence of societies in the face of changing climatic and environmental conditions? This ambitious project will provide insights into the sustainability and resilience of societies through both abrupt and longer term climate changes, leveraging the deep time perspective only available to archaeology.",

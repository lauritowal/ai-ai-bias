        "Title: Unveiling the Legacy of Babylonian Medical Science: A Comparative Study of Cuneiform and Aramaic Traditions\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project aims to bridge a significant gap in the history of medicine by conducting the first comprehensive study of ancient Babylonian medical science since the decipherment of cuneiform. Focusing on the intersection of cuneiform and Aramaic medical traditions, we will challenge prevailing Eurocentric narratives that prioritize Greek medicine. Our research will be guided by two key hypotheses: that cuneiform survived longer than previously thought, and that Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud is largely derived from Akkadian medicine. By adopting native taxonomies and comparing Babylonian medicine with neighboring systems, we will develop a new paradigm for understanding knowledge transfer in ancient medicine. This study will not only shed new light on the evolution of medical science but also highlight the significance of Babylonian medicine as a distinct and influential tradition that transcended linguistic and cultural boundaries."

The latest phase of Babylonian medicine, as preserved in Aramaic in the Babylonian Talmud, has never been systematically studied in the light of older cuneiform materials. The absence of accessible cuneiform medical literature has forced recent medical histories to bypass Babylonian medicine, while Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud has simply been ignored. BabMed tests a number of 'high risk' propositions, including two key hypotheses: 1) cuneiform survived much longer than previously suspected, and 2) Aramaic medicine in the Babylonian Talmud mostly derives from Akkadian medicine. BabMed's methodology relies upon native taxonomies rather than modern biomedical disease classifications, countering flawed retrospective diagnoses that obviate the entire history of medicine. Comparisons with neighbouring medical systems challenge the prevalent Eurocentricity of current histories, in which Greek medicine has become the standard for all ancient medicine. BabMed will introduce a new paradigm for knowledge transfer which will recognise the barriers between ancient arts of medicine and how they were overcome in antiquity. One such barrier was script and language, and BabMed proposes that Babylonian medicine survived the death of cuneiform script and was preserved in part in the local Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, a unique text which straddles the borders of Greco-Roman Palestine and Persian Babylonia and mirrors the scientific thinking of both worlds.",

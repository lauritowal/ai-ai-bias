        "**Title: Exploring Amazonian Ecologies through Cultural Productions**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, \"Amazonian Ecologies,\" delves into the intricate relationships between human and non-human entities in the Amazon region as depicted in cultural productions such as literature, film, art, and oral traditions. By integrating indigenous epistemologies and ecocritical theories, our research aims to unravel the dynamic interplay between humans, animals, and plants in shaping Amazonian cultural life. Through a novel concept, \"zoophytography,\" we seek to decentralize human-centric narratives and instead foreground the voices and agencies of non-human beings in Amazonian cultural expressions.\n\nOur research will be conducted in three interconnected streams. The first stream will establish a theoretical foundation for zoophytography by tracing its roots in Amazonian thought and Western philosophy. The second stream will focus on the representation of animals in Amazonian cultural productions, while the third stream will examine the inscription of plants in texts, cinema, and artworks. By analyzing a diverse range of sources from the 20th century onwards, we aim to contribute significantly to the environmental humanities, ecocriticism, and post-colonial studies.\n\nOur project seeks to foster a deeper understanding of the interdependencies between humans and non-humans in Amazonia, highlight the urgent need to address environmental degradation, and uncover more equitable perspectives on the region's fauna and flora. Ultimately, our research aspires to promote a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of the Amazonian ecosystem and its cultural significance."

The key hypothesis of ECO is that texts (broadly understood to include mythology, folk tales, the lyrics of songs, essays, literature, travel writings, etc.), cinema and art about this area highlight the ways in which non-human beings dynamically shape human cultural life. The project’s main challenge is to resort both to Amazonian thought and to the academic field of ecocriticism to assess how human cultural productions about Amazonia lend a voice to animals and plants. ECO develops the concept of zoophytography to describe the inscription of non-humans in texts, films and artworks, thus decentering humanity as the sole source of meaning-making. Research stream I. “Amazonian Zoophytography” formulates a definition of this notion and traces its roots to Indigenous and riverine epistemologies and to Western philosophy. Through archival research, ECO will then gather and analyze sources that portray Amazonian animals and plants from the beginning of the twentieth century onwards in two other research streams: II. “Animal Talk: Zoography Spelled Out” focuses on the articulation of animals in cultural productions about the Amazon; III. “Flora’s Voice: Phytographic Conversations” analyzes plant inscription in texts, cinema and artworks that question the role of vegetal life as a passive form of existence. ECO will make a significant contribution to the environmental humanities, offering an Amazonian perspective on ecocriticism, environmental philosophy and post-colonial studies. By creating a deeper understanding of conceptions of Amazonian fauna and flora, the project will reveal the interdependence of humans and non-humans, draw attention to environmental degradation in Amazonia and uncover more equitable views on animals and plants from the region.",

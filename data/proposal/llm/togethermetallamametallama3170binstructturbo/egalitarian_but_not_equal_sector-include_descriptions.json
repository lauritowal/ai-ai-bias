        "**Title:** Investigating the Intersection of Collective Bargaining and the Gender Pay Gap: A Comparative Study\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe persistent global disparity in earnings between men and women remains a pressing concern, with women averaging 20% lower pay than their male counterparts. Even in countries committed to eliminating this gap, such as those in Europe, a 13% disparity persists. This project seeks to explore the complex relationship between collective bargaining, a key institutional measure aimed at reducing the gender pay gap, and the wage dynamics in feminized and male-dominated sectors.\n\nFocusing on Germany, Norway, and Sweden, this research will investigate the past, present, and potential future of collective bargaining processes in the metal and nursing sectors. Through ethnographic methods, we will gather data at the sectoral level to achieve three primary objectives: (1) compare and synthesize the histories of collective bargaining and the gender pay gap in the selected countries, (2) analyze daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the metal and nursing sectors, and (3) document the relationships between actors in these sectors and the wage norms that contribute to sectoral gendered wage differentials.\n\nBy examining the intersection of collective bargaining and the gender pay gap from an inter-sectoral perspective, this study aims to contribute to the global effort to achieve gender equity and provide new insights into the economic dynamics that perpetuate wage disparities."

In countries explicitly committed to eliminating the gender pay gap (GPG), such as those in Europe, women still earn, on average, 13% less than men do (Eurostat, 2022). This is regardless of the fact that countries with persistent GPGs have deployed a strategic institutional measure to raise the wage floor of feminised work sectors and reduce the GPG – namely, collective bargaining. The overall aim of WAGE is to theorise the gendered nature of collective bargaining by investigating the past, the unruly present and the possible future of regulated collective bargaining processes in three key countries: Germany, Norway and Sweden. Moreover, the project’s research design will involve gathering data at the sectoral level of the metal sector and nursing and will use ethnographic research methods. To realise its overall aim, WAGE will accomplish the following three research objectives: 1. Compare and synthesise existing histories of collective bargaining and the GPG in the three selected countries. 2. Uncover and analyse daily practices in collective bargaining rounds that result in wage increases in the male dominated metal sector and the female dominated nursing sector. 3. Document and explain how actors embedded in the male dominated metal and the female dominated nursing sector relate to the wage norm and sectoral gendered wage differentials. Given the dearth of scholarship on the relationship between gendered wage differentials and collective bargaining processes from an inter-sectoral angle, this study will be the first to systematically use qualitative methods to explore the economic frontier between sectoral gendered wage differentials and collective wage formation, thereby contributing to the effort to achieve gender equity in practice.",

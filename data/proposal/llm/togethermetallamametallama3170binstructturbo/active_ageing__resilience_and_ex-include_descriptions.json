        "**Abstract:**\n\nTitle: Advancing Active Ageing through Conceptual Innovation and Intervention Development\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize the field of active ageing by developing a novel scale that captures the complexity of active ageing, evaluating its determinants and modifiers, and designing a sustainable intervention to promote it. Building on the World Health Organization's definition of active ageing, we will create a multidimensional assessment tool covering ability, activity, ambition, and autonomy. To identify the preconditions for active ageing, we will collect cross-sectional data from 1000 individuals aged 75, 80, and 85 years and employ state-of-the-art statistical methods to model the pathway to active ageing. A randomized controlled trial (N=200) will be conducted to test the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention incorporating counselling, technology, and volunteer support. Furthermore, we will examine cohort effects by comparing our findings to a pre-existing dataset collected 25 years ago, providing valuable insights into changes in older adults' functioning over time. By generating novel knowledge, developing a quantifiable scale, training young scientists, and producing evidence for active ageing promotion, this project aims to transform the field of ageing research and ultimately contribute to the development of effective strategies for promoting healthy ageing."

To develop a scale assessing the diversity of active ageing with four dimensions that are ability (what people can do), activity (what people do do), ambition (what are the valued activities that people want to do), and autonomy (how satisfied people are with the opportunity to do valued activities); 2. To examine health and physical and psychological functioning as the determinants and social and build environment, resilience and personal skills as modifiers of active ageing; 3. To develop a multicomponent sustainable intervention aiming to promote active ageing (methods: counselling, information technology, help from volunteers); 4. To test the feasibility and effectiveness on the intervention; and 5. To study cohort effects on the phenotypes on the pathway to active ageing. “If You Can Measure It, You Can Change It.” Active ageing assessment needs conceptual progress, which I propose to do. A quantifiable scale will be developed that captures the diversity of active ageing stemming from the WHO definition of active ageing as the process of optimizing opportunities for health and participation in the society for all people in line with their needs, goals and capacities as they age. I will collect cross-sectional data (N=1000, ages 75, 80 and 85 years) and model the pathway to active ageing with state-of-the art statistical methods. By doing this I will create novel knowledge on preconditions for active ageing. The collected cohort data will be compared to a pre-existing cohort data that was collected 25 years ago to obtain knowledge about changes over time in functioning of older people. A randomized controlled trial (N=200) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the envisioned intervention promoting active ageing through participation. The project will regenerate ageing research by launching a novel scale, by training young scientists, by creating new concepts and theory development and by producing evidence for active ageing promotion",

        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThe pressing global challenges of our time, including climate change and pandemics, underscore the need for unprecedented levels of cooperation among individuals and nations. However, the self-interest vs. collective interest dilemma often hinders effective cooperation, threatening the well-being of humanity. Current behavioral models of cooperation, drawn from economics, sociology, and psychology, offer limited insights due to their narrow focus on specific aspects of human behavior. This interdisciplinary research program aims to integrate theoretical and methodological approaches from these disciplines to develop a unified framework for understanding human cooperation.\n\nAt the heart of this project is the investigation of rule-following behavior as a fundamental building block of large-scale cooperation. A comprehensive model of behavioral principles will be developed and experimentally tested, followed by an examination of the interconnections between previously disparate principles of cooperation. This framework will be applied to prominent social dilemmas and validated through incentivized experiments conducted in representative samples from major economies worldwide.\n\nBy providing a novel, experimentally tested framework for understanding cooperation, this project will equip researchers, policymakers, and practitioners with essential tools and data to address pressing global challenges. Ultimately, this research aims to inform strategies for fostering cooperation and promoting collective action in the face of pressing global problems, such as climate change."

A failure to cooperate, that is, to act in one’s self-interest rather than the collective interest, could spell a bleak future for humanity. When are people prepared to play their part in the solution of these fundamental problems? Current behavioural models of cooperation from across the social sciences, including economics, are inadequate for answering this fundamental question, because they typically focus on one narrow aspect of people’s behaviour, but people might be motivated by different factors at the same time. Hence, to make progress, an integrated approach is needed. The major ambition of my interdisciplinary research programme is to achieve synergy by combining insights and methods from economics, sociology, and moral and social psychology into a novel experimentally tested framework thereby making a major step forward in the creation of a unified science of human cooperation. Rule following is the most basic behaviour to achieve large-scale cooperation. I will use it as a first step to develop, and experimentally test a comprehensive model of behavioural principles of cooperation. Second, I will then employ the framework to systematically investigate behavioural links between previously disjointed behavioural principles as developed across the social sciences. I also use the model to provide comprehensive new behavioural analyses of the most important models of social dilemmas. Finally, I will use the new framework in representative samples from major economies around the globe to explain people’s behaviour in relevant large-scale cooperation problems, most importantly caring for the climate, by using incentivised experiments. PRINCIPLES will equip researchers and policy makers across disciplines with behavioural principles, tools and data to study problems of cooperation using an interdisciplinary and experimentally tested framework.",

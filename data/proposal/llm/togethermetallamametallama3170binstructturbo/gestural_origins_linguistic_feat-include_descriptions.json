        "**Title: Investigating the Evolutionary Roots of Human Language through Comparative Ape Communication Studies**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nUnraveling the mysteries of human language evolution holds the key to understanding our species' unique identity. A crucial step in this pursuit is examining the communicative behaviors of our closest living relatives, the great apes. This project aims to build upon recent discoveries of systematic, meaningful communication in ape gestures, exploring their role in the emergence of human language. By leveraging a comprehensive pan-African dataset spanning 17 ape and 9 human groups, this research will tackle three primary objectives: (1) investigating cultural variation in ape gesture and the influence of species, environment, and social interaction on gesture acquisition and use; (2) examining the impact of signal combination on meaning in ape communication; and (3) comparing human and ape gesture use and comprehension in adults and children. By employing novel and established methodologies, this study seeks to shed new light on the evolutionary origins of human language, particularly the development of social learning and syntactic structure. Ultimately, this research will contribute significantly to our understanding of the complexities of human language and its place within the broader context of animal communication."

Other species’ communication contains rich information exchange; but humans do more than broadcast information. Language is used to communicate goals to partners, it goes beyond information: it has meaning. Only great ape gestures show similarly systematic meaningful communication; they are essential to understanding how human language evolved. Beyond meaning, two core features of human language are social learning and syntactic structure. These are universals, present across cultures. We all learn words and how to use them from others, leading to languages and dialects. We all use syntax; expressing different meanings by recombining words. In fact, these two features are common in animal communication: sperm whales learn songs from others; finches re-order notes into different songs. But, in a significant evolutionary puzzle, both appear absent in the communication of our closest relatives. The discovery of meanings in ape gesture resulted from studying ape communication under the challenging natural conditions that allow its full expression. A single study of a single group: it was the tip of the iceberg. Employing pan-African data across 17 ape and 9 human groups. I will tackle three major objectives. (1) Is there cultural variation in ape gesture? We will look at how species, physical environment, and social interaction affect how apes acquire and use gestures. (2) When apes combine signals, does it change their meaning? Moving beyond sequential structure we will look at how apes combine signals to construct meaning, and how the speed, size, and timing of gestures impacts meaning. (3) Human-ape gesture. We will investigate adults’ and children’s use and comprehension of gestures to compare them directly to other apes. Using new and established techniques across a dramatically wider sample I will address the fundamental question of how human language evolved.",

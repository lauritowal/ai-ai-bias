        "Title: Unifying Truth and Semantics: A Comprehensive Approach to Natural Language Semantics\n\nAbstract:\n\nNatural language semantics faces a challenge in assigning truth conditions to sentences involving complex belief and assumption structures, which can lead to paradoxical situations. Despite this, semanticists have largely overlooked these problems, leaving the field to philosophical logicians studying paradoxes of truth. This project aims to bridge the gap between natural language semantics and research on semantic paradoxes by providing a unified perspective on truth-conditional semantics and self-applicable truth theories.\n\nThe proposed research is divided into two interrelated parts. The first part, \"Truth in Semantics,\" focuses on developing semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, incorporating notions such as truth, modal expressions, propositional attitudes, and natural language conditionals. The second part, \"Truth and the Foundations of Semantics,\" adopts a metasemantic perspective, exploring the role of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics.\n\nThis project constitutes the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from a combined perspective, addressing two principal challenges: integrating truth into semantic accounts and understanding the role of truth in the foundations of semantics. By unifying these approaches, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of natural language semantics and its relationship to truth."

Does Anne believe that Bob's assumption is false?\" Don't try too hard answering the question - any straightforward attempt will lead to paradox. But what are we to make of sentences such as \"Anne believes that Bob's assumption is false.\" Is the sentence true or false? On the face of it, it would seem that answering this question is a pressing problem for natural language semantics that assigns truth conditions to sentences of natural language. However, semanticists have largely ignored problems of this kind, leaving the field to philosophical logicians working on paradoxes, in particular, the paradoxes of truth such as the Liar paradox. But research on the paradoxes of truth has often focused on exploring the space of possible coherent \"solutions\" to the paradoxes thereby ignoring desiderata of natural language semantics. The project provides a unified perspective on natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics, and the research on the so-called semantic paradoxes in form of theories of self-applicable truth. A unified approach to truth and semantics will need to answer two principal challenges, which divides the research project into two interrelated parts. The first part, Truth in Semantics, aims at developing semantic accounts for rich fragments of natural language, that is, fragments in which, besides the notion of truth, we allow for, e.g., modal expressions, propositional attitudes but also natural language conditionals. The second part, Truth and the Foundations of Semantics, assumes a metasemantic perspective and explores the role of the notion of truth in the foundations of natural language semantics, conceived of as truth-conditional semantics. The project constitutes the first systematic study of truth and natural language semantics from such a combined perspective.",

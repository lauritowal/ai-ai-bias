        "**Title:** Unveiling Collective Knowledge Generation in Particle Physics through Digital Humanities\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to advance our understanding of knowledge production and validation in large-scale scientific collaborations through innovative applications of digital humanities tools. Focusing on the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), we will reconstruct internal communication networks from born-digital documents to elucidate the epistemological dynamics of collective research processes. Our working hypothesis posits that a bird's-eye view analysis of these communication networks can reveal valuable insights into the generation and validation of knowledge. By developing historiographic guidelines for analyzing born-digital sources, this project will provide a framework for future studies of modern scientific collaborations. Furthermore, our research will contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, particularly in the context of network epistemology, by refining theoretical models to better accommodate the complexities of real-world cases. By leveraging digital tools and computational methods, we aim to capture the intricacies of large-scale research processes and provide a comprehensive picture of contemporary research practice in particle physics and beyond."

The project will focus on an investigation of recent research practice in particle physics at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in order to gain a better understanding of how knowledge is generated and validated in very large scientific collaborations. The main working hypothesis of the project is that collective research processes can be characterized, in epistemologically relevant terms, through a bird’s eye view analysis of the collaboration’s internal communication. The internal communication will be reconstructed from born-digital documents (e-mails, internal wiki pages, etc.) which accrue in the research practice of the collaboration. Abstracting from the case study, the project will also develop historiographic guidelines that can be transferred to future epistemological studies of modern scientific collaborations. Last but not least, the project will contribute to the philosophy of collective knowledge generation, in particular to recent issues in “network epistemology”, by adapting the theoretical models to better fit important real-world cases. Until recently, it was nearly impossible to capture large-scale and complex research processes, such as the ones at CERN, and make them accessible for epistemological analysis. Almost all the studies of the research practice at CERN or similar cases have so far been restricted to the analysis of published articles, selected interviews and participant observation. Accompanied by historiographic guidelines and practical strategies (both of which are lacking at the moment) for best practices in the history and philosophy of science based on born-digital sources, the application of digital tools and computational methods may finally help us attain a maximally comprehensive picture of recent research practice in particle physics and beyond.",

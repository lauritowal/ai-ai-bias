    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nA multidisciplinary research project is proposed to investigate the initial human colonization of Australasia, which occurred at least 50,000 years ago. This migration represents a pivotal moment in human history, marking one of the earliest instances of modern human seafaring and settlement outside Africa. The project will adopt a comprehensive approach, integrating cutting-edge marine geophysical, hydrodynamic, and archaeogenetic analyses to elucidate the timing, location, demographic characteristics, and technological advancements associated with this early seafaring event. Focusing on the Sunda to Sahul migration, the research will explore the submerged palaeolandscape of the northwestern Australian continental shelf to identify potential prehistoric sites, refine knowledge of the onshore/offshore environment, and reconstruct the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime. Complementary archaeogenetic research will analyze mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to resolve questions of demography and chronology. This innovative project will provide new insights into human origins, environmental adaptation, population dynamics, seafaring technology, and cognitive development, addressing fundamental questions about the peopling of Australasia."

This represents some of the earliest evidence of modern human colonization outside Africa, yet, even at the greatest sea-level lowstand, this migration would have involved seafaring. It is the maritime nature of this dispersal which makes it so important to questions of technological, cognitive and social human development. These issues have traditionally been the preserve of archaeologists, but with a multidisciplinary approach that embraces cutting-edge marine geophysical, hydrodynamic and archaeogenetic analyses, we now have the opportunity to examine the When, Where, Who and How of the earliest seafaring in world history. The voyage from Sunda (South East Asia) to Sahul (Australasia) provides evidence for the earliest ‘open water’ crossing in the world. A combination of the sparse number of early archaeological finds and the significant changes in the palaeolandscape and submergence of the broad north western Australian continental shelf, mean that little is known about the routes taken and what these crossings may have entailed. This project will combine research of the submerged palaeolandscape of the continental shelf to refine our knowledge of the onshore/offshore environment, identify potential submerged prehistoric sites and enhance our understanding of the palaeoshoreline and tidal regime. This will be combined with archaeogenetic research targeting mtDNA and Y-chromosome data to resolve questions of demography and dating. For the first time this project takes a truly multidisciplinary approach to address the colonization of Sahul, providing an unique opportunity to tackle some of the most important questions about human origins, the relationship between humans and the changing environment, population dynamics and migration, seafaring technology, social organisation and cognition.",

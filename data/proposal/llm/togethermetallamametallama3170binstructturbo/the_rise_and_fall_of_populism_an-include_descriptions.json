        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nRising Populism in Advanced Democracies: Understanding the Interplay of Economic Shocks, Personal Experiences, and Information Environment\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the underlying causes of the recent surge in populist movements in advanced democracies. Specifically, it aims to examine the role of negative economic shocks, personal experiences, and information environment in shaping individuals' political decisions. The research consists of three interconnected components. The first component explores how personal employment histories, individual predispositions, and information environment influenced voting patterns in the 2016 US presidential election, utilizing a novel dataset of over 40 million resumes and zipcode-level economic and voting variables. The second component investigates the long-term effects of negative social experiences during formative years on labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and support for populist agendas, focusing on the impact of corporal punishment in UK schools during the 1970s and 1980s. The third component examines the determinants of resistance to extremist regimes, analyzing a historical case study of resistance to the Nazi regime in Germany during World War II. By combining innovative data sources and interdisciplinary approaches, this project aims to provide insights into the complex interactions between economic shocks, personal experiences, and information environment that contribute to the rise of populism in advanced democracies."

Is populism caused by negative economic shocks? If so, what are the mechanisms? What explains heterogeneity in responses to such shocks? In this project, I will test empirically if personal experiences, information environment, and their interaction with aggregate economic shocks shape peopleâ€™s political decisions. The project consists of three parts. First, I will study how personal employment histories, potentially affected by globalization and technological shocks, individual predispositions, and information environment influenced voting for Trump. I will use a unique database of more than 40 million resumes for the period 2010-2016, the largest available repository of resumes of job-seekers in the US, which was not previously used in academic research, and match it with zipcode-level economic and voting variables. Second, I will study how negative social experiences during the formative years affect subsequent labor market outcomes, antisocial behavior, and the support of populist agenda. I will examine how corporal punishment in schools in UK affected subsequent educational attainment, employment, antisocial behavior, and voting for UKIP and Brexit. I will digitize archival records on regulations and practice of corporal punishment in different educational authorities in the UK during 1970-80s, combining it with contemporary outcomes. Third, I will examine what makes people actively resist extremist regimes even when it is associated with high personal costs. I will study a historical example of resistance to Nazi regime in Germany during the WWII, which provides unique methodological opportunity to study determinants of resistance to extremism in a high stake environment. I will use a self-collected dataset on treason cases to measure resistance, combining it with data on bombing and exposure to foreign propaganda.",

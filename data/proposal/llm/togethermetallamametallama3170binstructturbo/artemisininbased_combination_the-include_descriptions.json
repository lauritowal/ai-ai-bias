        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a multidisciplinary research project that explores the complexities of the global pharmaceutical market through a case study of Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) in Africa and Asia. By examining the realities of ACT supply and demand in Benin and Ghana, two countries with distinct pharmaceutical systems, this project aims to shed light on the globalizing processes affecting the market and their impact on public health. To address the pressing concern of ACT resistance transmission from Asia to Africa, a comparative study of the pharmaceutical system in Cambodia will also be conducted.\n\nA multidisciplinary approach will be employed, combining anthropology, epidemiology, and sociology to provide a comprehensive understanding of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply chains, drug use, and regulatory frameworks. The project will involve collaborative research with experts in each field and will support the training of 8 master's students, 2 PhD students, and 1 postdoctoral researcher.\n\nThe project's objectives are twofold: to inform the development of more efficient pharmaceutical systems in Africa and to provide critical information to prevent the spread of ACT resistance from Asia to Africa. The research findings will be disseminated through two symposia and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the global pharmaceutical market and its implications for public health."

With dimensions that are simultaneously scientific, therapeutic, popular and commercial, these drugs are central to various issues. ACTs, the new recommended treatment for malaria in Africa, crystallize these issues and provide a case study to investigate the global drug market. This project proposes to use ACTs as a lens to study the realities affecting this market, both in terms of supply and demand in two African countries where the pharmaceutical systems differ significantly. This will involve analyzing the globalizing processes affecting drugs in Benin and Ghana and to study their consequences on public health. To further compare the drug systems and to address the serious issue of the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa, the project also proposes conducting a study on the drug system in Cambodia. The central discipline is anthropology, which is extremely relevant to the study of formal and informal pharmaceutical supply and to the analysis of drug use (WP1 and WP2). However, since a multidisciplinary approach is advised for drug studies, the PI will work with an epidemiologist who will study the scope of ACT consumption (WP3) and a sociologist specializing in pharmaceutical legislation who will analyze local production and ACT regulations (WP4). Opening into Asia will occur through WP5. A WP6 is devoted to project management, dissemination of results, organizing two symposiums and institutional twofold impacts: (1) to foster reflection so that more efficient pharmaceutical systems are established in Africa, and (2) to provide critical information to prevent the spread of resistances to ACTs from Asia to Africa. The project includes a substantial training component: 8 master students, 2 PhD and 1 post-doct. The PI’s skills in methodology and theory and the solid partnerships she has developed in Benin and Ghana will support the project’s feasibility.",

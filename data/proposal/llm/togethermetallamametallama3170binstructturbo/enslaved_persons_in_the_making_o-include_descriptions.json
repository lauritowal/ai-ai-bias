        "**Rethinking Ancient Societies: Unveiling the Agency of Enslaved Persons**\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize our understanding of ancient societies by shifting the focus to the active roles enslaved individuals played in shaping their worlds. By examining the complex identities, communities, and networks created by enslaved persons, we will uncover the profound impact of slave agency on politics, social structures, economies, and cultures across Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. This comprehensive study will move beyond the traditional focus on classical Greece and Roman Italy, incorporating a wide range of ancient languages and archaeological data.\n\nOur research team will develop a groundbreaking digital prosopography of ancient slaves, featuring sources in their original languages and English translations. This innovative tool will enable new forms of quantitative and qualitative analysis, contributing significantly to the field of Digital Humanities. Our project will yield a monograph, two collective volumes, 15 articles, three PhD dissertations, and a dedicated website, ultimately rewriting the history of antiquity with enslaved individuals at its core."

It will examine the multiple identities of enslaved persons, the communities and networks that they created or participated in, and how slave agency brought about major political, social, economic and cultural changes in the ancient world. By exploring the various forms of slave agency, SLaVEgents will offer a radically new perspective on antiquity from the point of view of history from below. The project moves beyond the usual focus on slavery in classical Greece and Roman Italy to offer a comprehensive examination of the history of enslaved persons across Western Eurasia and North Africa between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. SLaVEgents is the first project to examine together all ancient slaveries from Mesopotamia to the Atlantic, and include sources in the full range of ancient languages (Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Latin) and the relevant archaeological data. The research team – composed of the PI, eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral researchers and three PhD candidates – will construct a large-scale digital prosopography of all attested ancient slaves which will include all relevant sources in the original and in English translation. The Linked Open Data created by the digital prosopography will enable new forms of quantitative and qualitative research and will make a significant contribution to Digital Humanities. The monograph and the two collective volumes of the project will offer an important step towards rewriting the history of antiquity with slaves at its centre. In addition, the project will deliver fifteen articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, one international conference and a website.",

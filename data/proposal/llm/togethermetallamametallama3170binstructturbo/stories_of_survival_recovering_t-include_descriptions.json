        "Title: Unveiling the Global Histories of Eastern Christianity: A Transnational Analysis\n\nAbstract:\n\nEastern Christians have long been dispersed across the globe, with their modern-day presence in countries such as Argentina and Sweden often attributed to contemporary events in the Middle East. However, this phenomenon has its roots in the early modern period, when Christians from the Ottoman Empire migrated to distant lands, leaving behind a trail of literary, documentary, and printed sources. This project aims to gather and analyze these disparate sources, reconstituting a 'lost archive' that spans three continents, ten languages, and numerous archives. A team of researchers, led by the Principal Investigator, will employ a rigorous methodology that combines philology and source criticism to uncover the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity from 1500 to 1750. By bridging the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history, this project will address a pressing conceptual challenge in global history: linking micro-scale everyday life to macro-narratives. The project's outcomes will include print publications, workshops, and a searchable database of Eastern Christian writings, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of global history and its methodologies."

Too often, however, this global migration has been seen purely as a modern development, one arising from contemporary political and confessional events in the Middle East, while in fact this phenomenon had its roots in the early modern period. From the sixteenth century onwards, Christians from the Ottoman Empire set out for distant worlds and foreign lands, travelling as far as Europe, India, Russia, and even the Americas and leaving traces of themselves across countless European and Middle Eastern archives, chanceries, and libraries. This transnational, ground-breaking project will gather all of these disparate sources into a single analytical frame to uncover, for the first time, the global and connected histories of Eastern Christianity in the early modern world. Through the work of a team of researchers under the close supervision of the PI, the project will reconstitute and analyse a ‘lost archive’ of literary, documentary, and printed sources in three continents, ten languages, and dozens of archives. Under the expert leadership of the PI, the project will include a robust strategy for dissemination, which will successfully bridge the fields of Middle Eastern, European, and global history. In doing so, this project will respond directly to one of the most pressing conceptual challenges facing global history today, that is, how to link the study of the micro-scale level of everyday life to the macro-narratives emphasised by global historians. Underlying this project, therefore, is a major intervention that seeks to advance a rigorous form of global history, and one which preserves philology and source criticism at the heart of its methodology. The outcomes of the project will include print-publications, workshops, and a searchable database of all writings by Eastern Christians from 1500 to 1750.",

        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project reexamines the early history of European political economy, shifting the focus from the evolution of modern economic theories to its practical applications in improving human life. By exploring the 18th-century literature on betterment and improvement, the study aims to reconstruct the meaning of political economy in its historical context. The Swedish empire, renowned for its emphasis on \"oeconomia,\" serves as the primary case study, with comparative analyses of other regions to broaden the project's applicability. The research will investigate how key concepts of improvement – wealth, growth, and welfare – were articulated in various sites of intellectual production, including universities, government institutions, and academic journals. By analyzing the activities of these institutions, the project seeks to demonstrate how they contributed to the development of economic argumentation in the 18th century. This research offers a nuanced reassessment of the rise of economic thought, challenging conventional narratives by highlighting the practical concerns and discursive practices that shaped the field of political economy."

Historians of political economy have traditionally concentrated on the genesis of modern economics, tracing the emergence of economic models, methods and ideas that are today recognized as 'economics' through 'classical political economy', neo-classicism and on to the present. This new departure treats political economy as a discourse oriented to the improvement of conditions for human life and, as such, one of the Enlightenment’s key contributions to Western thought. However, any direct association of Enlightenment discourse with political economy requires qualification. Therefore, this project explores a very extensive contemporary literature about growth, wealth and welfare that has not fitted easily into the conventional retrospective history. Instead of converting past arguments into modern arguments about methods and models, the project investigates eighteenth-century political economy in terms of practical concerns, as measures and policies for betterment and improvement. Only in this way we can reconstruct what political economy meant to its contemporaries in the early modern period. The Swedish empire – considered by contemporaries as the stronghold of 'oeconomia' – functions as the primary case study, but is constantly compared with other cases, broadening the applicability of the findings. The aim of the project is to study the ways in which the key concepts of improvement – wealth, growth and welfare – were articulated in the main sites of discursive production: the University, the Diet, local and colonial governments, and academic journals. The study of the five institutions is based on the hypothesis that in each of them activities were directed towards improving the organisation of state and society and the living conditions of the people. This project represents a well-founded reassessment of the rise to predominance of economic argument during the eighteenth century.",

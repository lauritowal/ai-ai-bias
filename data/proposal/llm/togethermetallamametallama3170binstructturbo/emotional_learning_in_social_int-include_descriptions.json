        "**Title:** Elucidating the Neural Mechanisms of Emotional Learning in Social Interactions\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposed research project aims to break new ground in the field of emotional learning by examining its critical role in shaping social interactions. By integrating cutting-edge experimental methods with two previously distinct areas of research - the biology of aversive learning and social cognition - this study seeks to address four core objectives. These objectives include identifying the mechanisms of aversive learning about others, learning from others through observation, learning during social interactions, and developing a neural model of social-emotional learning. A multi-disciplinary approach will be employed, incorporating behavioral paradigms, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. The project hypothesizes that social-emotional learning is mediated by the interplay of four partially overlapping neural networks, which will be investigated to shed light on the underlying mechanisms. The findings of this research will significantly contribute to our understanding of social phenomena, such as intergroup conflicts and norm compliance, and provide valuable insights into psychological disorders characterized by dysfunctions in social-emotional learning, including social anxiety, autism, and psychopathy."

By bringing together a novel set of experimental manipulations with two hitherto unconnected lines of research; biology of aversive learning and social cognition, it aims at answering four specific objectives, namely to identify the mechanisms of aversive learning (1) about others and its dependence on stimulus bound (e.g. ethnic group belonging) and conceptual (e.g. moral and social status) characteristics; (2) from others through observation, and its dependence on processing of stimulus bound (e.g. emotional expressiveness) and conceptual (e.g. empathy and mental state attributions) characteristics; (3) during interaction and its dependence social characteristics as described in 1 and 2; and (4) build and test a neural model of social-emotional learning. To achieve these objectives, I propose a multi-method research program using novel behavioral paradigms and manipulated virtual environments, cognitive neuroscience, psychophysiology, and behavioral genetics. I predict that social emotional learning will be accomplished through the interaction of four, partially overlapping, neural networks coding for affective, associative, social cognitive and instrumental/goal directed aspects. Whereas the two first networks will be common to classical conditioning and social learning, I hypothesize that the latter will be distinguished by its reliance on the social-cognitive network. The fourth network is predicted to be integral to the social learning through interactions and the shaping of behavioral norms. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of important social phenomena, such as group conflicts and norm compliance. It will also shed light on common psychological disorders, such as social anxiety, autism and psychopathy that are characterized by dysfunctional of the social emotional learning system.",

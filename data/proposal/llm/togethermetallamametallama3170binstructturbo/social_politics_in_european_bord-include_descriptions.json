        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research project reevaluates the history of European welfare and social care systems by emphasizing the pivotal role of local actors, such as families and associations, in shaping these systems across three border regions: Galicia, the North-eastern Adriatic, and the Franco/Belgian/German border regions. From the late 19th century to the 1990s, our study will scrutinize the dynamic interplay between public and private actors in these regions, where the influence of central states varied and diverse local welfare structures, often rooted in non-state identities and affiliations, coexisted. By comparing and contextualizing local case studies within a broader transnational framework, we will uncover the complex dynamics of inclusion and exclusion that have long characterized European welfare provision. Our findings will provide valuable historical insights into the development of welfare systems across Europe, ultimately informing contemporary debates on welfare reform and social rights in the region."

By focusing on the interactions among local actors and following developments from the late 19th century to the 1990s, this project turns our attention to the co-construction of welfare by public and private actors in highly mixed borderlands, where the reach of central states often fluctuated and a range of local welfare structures, based on national, but also non-national forms of identity/solidarity (e.g., occupation or religion) flourished. The focus on overlapping, and, at times, competing structures of social provision will allow me and my team to examine the interplays between inclusion and exclusion that have long shaped European welfare provision by zeroing in on those contexts where such competition was particularly visible. We will do this by placing intensively researched local studies in comparative and transnational frameworks, examining similarities and differences between north-western, eastern and south-eastern borderlands while tracing the circulation of ideas, people and practices. It is our conviction that the long-range historical study of local actors’ ideas and practices around social welfare in European borderlands has much to tell us about the development of welfare across Europe in general. Our comparative and transnational analysis of the three borderlands will thus enable us to contribute constructively to contemporary societal debates about welfare reform at a time when the social rights (or lack thereof) of populations in Europe are the subject of acrimonious, even violent debate.",

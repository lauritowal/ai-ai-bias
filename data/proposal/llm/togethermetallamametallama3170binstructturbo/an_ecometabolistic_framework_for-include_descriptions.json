        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to transform sustainable building practices by adopting a bio-based material approach, addressing the pressing issue of material depletion. Despite growing awareness and legislative efforts, architecture has been slow to adapt. Bio-based materials, characterized by their complexity, unpredictability, and limited lifespan, require a fundamental shift in design thinking. This research identifies the primary barriers to this transition as the inability to accurately represent, conceptualize, and operationalize bio-based materials. To overcome these challenges, a holistic eco-metabolic framework is proposed, enabling the creation of carbon-neutral, renewable, and optimized design solutions. Through a research-by-design methodology, this project explores three bio-based material perspectives and develops advanced computational modeling tools for predictive analysis, adaptive fabrication, and environmental sensing. By redefining the role of design agency and introducing participatory practices of continuous construction, this research aims to redefine the concept of material lifespan and promote a more sustainable, socially conscious, and democratic model of production."

Despite well-organised calls for action maturing into legislation and an attentive profession, architecture is proving reticent in this transition. Bio-based materials are fundamentally different to current building materials being characterised by their complex heterogeneity, unpredictable behaviours and limited lifespans. This project identifies that the key impediments to this transition lie with architectureâ€™s inability to represent, conceptualise and operationalise bio-based materials. It argues that to design with bio-based materials we must challenge the fundamental value proposition of architecture and expand our conception of material lifespan to find new practices of construction. It proposes a holistic eco-metabolistic framework, that allows for carbon-neutral, renewable and materially optimised design solutions. It employs a research-by-design method to investigate three bio-based material perspectives (glulam, bio-polymer composites and bioluminescent bacteria) and instrumentalises them through three advanced computational modelling networks for the predictive modelling, adaptive fabrication and environmental sensing of bio-based materials. It challenges our preconception of design agency as restricted to the traditional cut-off point of building completion, proposing new participatory practices of continual construction to recast the short lifespans of bio-based materials as effective properties of a new sustainable practice. By enabling us to think of buildings as co-present and actively engaged through processes of maintenance and intervention, the project responds to the search for sustainable, more socially conscious and more democratic models of production.",

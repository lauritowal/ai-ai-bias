        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThis research project seeks to redefine the boundaries of musical interpretation, shifting focus from text-based to performance-based musical experiences. It aims to investigate the historical context of traditional musical interpretation, develop new methodological paths through experimental performance practices, and explore the applicability of scientific experimentation models to music performance. By engaging in material artistic practices, the project will produce tangible artistic outputs, driving innovations in both theory and practice. At the forefront of Artistic Research, this project combines theoretical inquiry with practical music-making, offering an alternative to traditional notions of musical interpretation. Embedded within the Orpheus Research Centre in Music's focus on Artistic Experimentation, this project will contribute to and draw from the broader discourse, ultimately presenting a compelling case for change in the field of musical performance. By integrating critical reflection with concrete artistic outputs, it will provide audible and accessible examples of new possibilities in music performance, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of musical interpretation and its relationship to artistic practice."

The aim of this research proposal is to investigate: (a) the extent to which the traditional conception of musical interpretation is bound to a given historical period; (b) how new investigative paths can be created through experimental performance practices; and (c) the extent to which the scientific model of the practice of experimentation is transferable to music performance. Crucial to these objectives is the material engagement in artistic practice, including the generation of concrete artistic outputs by the PI and other team members. The practice of music – understood as a fundamental methodological tool for the generation and exposition of new knowledge, will contribute decisively to innovations in both theory and practice, opening up opportunities for both scholarship and future performance practices. While exploring alternative approaches to music performance, this project will deliver concrete examples of such possibilities, situating itself at the frontline of the burgeoning field of Artistic Research. Combining theoretical investigation with the concrete practice of music, this project presents a case for change in the field of musical performance. Alongside critical reflection on the state-of-the-art, it proposes a graspable and ‘audible’ alternative to traditional understandings of ‘interpretation’ in musical performance. Hosted at the Orpheus Research Centre in Music, it will benefit from, and contribute to, the wider discourse on Artistic Experimentation, the Centre's current research focus.",

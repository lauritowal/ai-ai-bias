        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal challenges the dominance of alphabet-centric thinking in Western linguistic theory by exploring the possibility that languages utilize fundamental properties of the acoustic signal to convey meaning. Contrary to the traditional view that words and phonemes are the building blocks of language, our approach suggests that low-level acoustic features directly contribute to reducing uncertainty in speech comprehension. Preliminary findings using wide learning networks demonstrate remarkable congruence with human processing strengths and weaknesses in reading and speech comprehension. Leveraging this novel paradigm, we aim to further develop our account of auditory comprehension, expand our modeling to diverse languages, extend our approach to speech production, and establish a discrimination-based language theory. This research has significant implications for our understanding of human language processing and the development of more accurate and effective machine learning models. Funding will support the next phase of this groundbreaking research, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge in linguistics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence."

Training in literacy starts in early childhood, and because of this, words and letter-like sound units can naturally seem to be the building blocks of language. The Chinese writing system highlights the cultural-specificity of this approach: characters are juxtaposed without intervening spaces, and their interpretation is highly context-dependent. Words are not singled out. And although more frequent characters contain parts indicating pronunciation, it is syllables that are referred to, not letter-like sound units. The research proposed here seeks to break the hold that the alphabet-centric approach has on our understanding of language by exploring the idea that instead of being phone and word-based, languages use low-level properties of the acoustic signal to directly reduce uncertainty about the messages encoded in the speech signal. My work with wide learning networks (two-layer networks with many thousands of units, using the simplest possible error-driven learning rule) provides remarkable support for this suggestion: For reading and speech comprehension, their performance closely matches both the strengths and the weaknesses of human processing. Especially at a time when machine learning and artificial intelligence are moving beyond human capacity, it is a methodological imperative to study and work with algorithms reflecting both the advantages and disadvantages of human learning. I am requesting funding to take this radically novel research program to the next level by further developing our account of auditory comprehension, by modeling more typologically diverse languages, by extending this approach to speech production, and by developing a discrimination-based language theory.",

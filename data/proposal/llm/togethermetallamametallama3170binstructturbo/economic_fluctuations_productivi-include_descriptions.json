        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal**\n\nThis research project aims to bridge the existing gap between the study of business cycles and long-run productivity growth in macroeconomic literature. By developing a unified Keynesian growth framework, this proposal seeks to understand the intricate relationships between economic fluctuations, productivity growth, and stabilization policies. The proposed framework integrates the Keynesian concept of aggregate demand-driven fluctuations with the endogenous growth literature's notion that productivity growth results from firms' innovation investments.\n\nThe project is divided into three parts. The first part will develop a novel Keynesian growth model with heterogeneous firms, applying it to investigate the impact of monetary and fiscal policies on productivity growth, the behavior of productivity during financial crises, and the potential for pessimistic expectations to trigger stagnation. The second part will extend the framework to an open economy setting, examining the interactions between monetary policy, capital flows, and productivity growth. The third part will empirically test the hypothesis that productivity growth responds to business cycle fluctuations and policy interventions, using data from the United States and a panel of advanced economies.\n\nBy providing a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between business cycles, productivity growth, and policy interventions, this project aims to contribute to the development of more effective stabilization policies and inform the ongoing policy debate."

Yet, the interactions between economic fluctuations, productivity growth and stabilization policies are well present in the policy debate, especially since the start of the Great Recession. In this proposal, I will develop a Keynesian growth framework to study business cycles and growth in a unified theory. The framework combines the Keynesian insight that fluctuations might be driven by changes in aggregate demand, with the notion, developed by the endogenous growth literature, that productivity growth is the result of firmsâ€™ investment in innovation. In part I, I will develop a novel Keynesian growth model with heterogeneous firms, in the spirit of the state-of-the-art quantitative endogenous growth literature. I will use the framework to study the impact of monetary and fiscal policy on productivity growth; to understand the behavior of productivity during large recessions triggered by financial crises, such as the recent Great Recession; and to investigate the possibility that pessimistic expectations might give rise to periods of stagnation. In part II, I will provide an open economy Keynesian growth model, able to capture the interactions between monetary policy, capital flows and productivity growth. I will use the framework to explain why the inception of the euro was associated with a sharp increase in capital flows across its member countries, and with stagnant productivity growth in countries recipients of capital inflows. In part III, I will test the hypothesis, at the heart of the Keynesian growth framework, that productivity growth responds to business cycle fluctuations and to monetary and fiscal policy interventions. To this end, I will estimate the empirical response of productivity growth to policy and business cycle shocks, both in the United States and in a panel of advanced economies.",

        "Title: Unraveling the Role of Myelin in Human Learning and Development\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe human brain's capacity for learning and plasticity is unparalleled in the animal kingdom, yet the biological basis of this remarkable adaptability remains poorly understood. Recent advances in MRI technology offer a groundbreaking opportunity to investigate the role of myelin in human learning and development. This project, \"Myelin and Learning Across the Lifespan\" (MAL), aims to elucidate the relationship between myelin maturation and learning abilities across different stages of human development. By leveraging a novel two-pronged approach combining longitudinal studies with large-scale data analysis, MAL will probe changes in myelin levels during learning in infants, children, young adults, and older adults. Our investigation will focus on key developmental milestones, including motor skill acquisition, literacy, and novel skill learning. This ambitious study will provide critical insights into the interactions between maturational and learning-related changes in myelin, shedding light on the biological basis of human learning and cognitive development. Ultimately, MAL will contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying psychological and neurological disorders associated with myelin alterations, such as schizophrenia, autism, and learning disabilities."

What is the biological basis of this remarkable plasticity? Animal studies suggest a critical role of myelin in learning and brain plasticity, while post-mortem assessments of the human brain show that myelin maturation, which is completed around birth in other species, continues until adulthood. How does this uniquely protracted myelin development enable and constrain our aptitude for learning? WRAPPED will answer this critical question by assessing changes in myelin during learning at different developmental stages. Recent critical advances in MRI technology now provide the unprecedented opportunity to compare myelin levels within the living human brain over time and between individuals making it possible to probe the role of myelin in human learning for the first time. Seizing this opportunity, WRAPPED will assess learning-related changes in myelin using an innovative two-pronged approach that combines local longitudinal studies with the analysis of large-scale open data. Critically, WRAPPED will not only evaluate adults, but rather probe the entire developmental lifespan to show how myelin changes as infants learn to crawl, when children enter school, and when children, young adults, and older adults are acquiring the same novel skills (juggling and reading Chinese). This ambitious developmental focus will be transformative for our understanding of the interactions between maturational and learning-related changes in myelin. Thereby, WRAPPED will elucidate the biological basis of the unique human learning trajectory that allows us to establish and maintain complex cultures. This characterization of healthy human brain plasticity, in turn, will serve as a vital reference point for understanding psychological and neurological disorders linked to alterations in myelin, such as schizophrenia, autism, and childhood learning disabilities.",

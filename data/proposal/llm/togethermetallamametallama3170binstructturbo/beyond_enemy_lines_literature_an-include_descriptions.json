        "This project explores the intersection of Anglo-American and German literary and cinematic traditions during the Allied Occupation of post-war Germany. By mapping the cultural terrain of the British and American zones, it aims to forge a new understanding of the post-war era, shedding light on three key areas: the Allied Occupation, the interconnected evolution of Anglophone and Germanophone literature, and the interplay between post-war and Cold War cultural dynamics. This multidisciplinary study will integrate literary and film analysis, cultural history, and life-writing to uncover a previously underappreciated field of research, redefining our understanding of post-war culture and its lasting legacies."

It will be the first study to survey the cultural landscape of the British and American zones of Occupied Germany in any detail. By doing so it will offer a new interpretative framework for postwar culture, in particular in three areas: the history of the Allied Occupation of Germany; the history of postwar Anglophone and Germanophone literature (arguing the two were more intertwined than has previously been suggested); and the history of the relationship between postwar and Cold War. Combining Anglo-American and German literature and film history with critical analysis, cultural history and life-writing, this is a necessarily ambitious, multidisciplinary study which will open up a major new field of research.",

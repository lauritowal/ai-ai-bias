        "**Title: Unveiling the Hidden Histories of Nordic Polychromed Heritage**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to uncover the complex and changing fortunes of richly painted and gilded Christian images in the Nordic countries since the Reformation. Through an innovative, multidisciplinary approach, we will investigate the transformation of these potent objects of devotion into cultural heritage, and assess the risks they currently face. Focusing on approximately 150 polychromed objects, our research will harness cutting-edge technologies from the natural sciences to analyze the material properties of these artifacts and shed light on their often unclear histories. By creating a comprehensive analytical overview, we aim to determine whether damage and losses can be attributed to targeted violence, accidents, or inherent weaknesses. This research will challenge existing narratives about the preservation of medieval devotional objects in the Nordic region and inform future conservation strategies, ultimately contributing to a nuanced understanding of the complex values and meanings attached to these cultural heritage objects. Our findings will have significant implications for the preservation and care of religious heritage in the region, and will inform training priorities for heritage professionals in the years to come."

How have wooden sculptures, panel paintings, shrines, and winged altarpieces transformed from potent objects of devotion to cultural heritage? To what extent is this category of cultural heritage at risk? Values attached to Catholic devotional objects have fluctuated dramatically since Gustav I of Sweden and Christian III of Denmark-Norway declared a break with the church in Rome (1527 and 1537, respectively). However, documentary sources shed little light on changes in status, volatility, and repairs. POLYCHROME will take an ambitious leap that scholars concerned with polychromy in Denmark, Norway and Sweden have been reluctant to make: to determine the extent to which losses of noses, eyes and limbs are tied to iconoclastic acts. To date, historians and most conservators have attributed damage to accidents or unspecific vandalism, but not to targeted violence. This is due in part to a lack of archival evidence, but also because secondary paints often mask critical information on surfaces and in internal structures. POLYCHROME will harness technologies from the natural sciences to create, from the ground up, the first analytical overview of c. 150 polychromed objects that are (or potentially were) partially mutilated. The material data will offer essential foundations for determining whether damages and losses can be linked to violence, accidents or inherent weakness. The data will guide the mapping of restorations and repairs, and will establish foundations for multidisciplinary studies and cross-cultural debates about heritage values and the future care of religious heritage in the Nordics. The outcomes will complicate conversations about the preserving effects of Lutheranism on medieval devotional objects, and will influence training priorities for years to come.",

    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal aims to support the development of OsciLang, a groundbreaking, wearable brain-computer interface neurofeedback system designed to diagnose and treat language disorders such as dyslexia and specific language impairment. By leveraging recent advances in neural oscillation research during speech processing, OsciLang will harness the potential of neurofeedback to enhance brain-speech synchronization. This innovative system utilizes electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor and provide real-time feedback on neural activity, empowering individuals to shape their brain function and improve literacy skills.\n\nTargeting the theta and delta frequency bands, OsciLang's proprietary algorithms will capitalize on the discovery of impaired auditory processing in dyslexic individuals. By providing a user-friendly interface and real-time feedback, OsciLang enables participants to exercise top-down control over specific neural activation patterns, thereby strengthening brain-speech synchronization.\n\nOsciLang has far-reaching implications, not only for individuals with language disorders but also as a foundation for a general framework to enhance reading abilities in the broader population. This project will pioneer a novel approach to neurofeedback training, paving the way for affordable and accessible interventions for language and literacy development."

To date there is no established neurofeedback protocols for treating language or reading impairments. In essence, this tool will (a) diagnose/measure and (b) improve/rehabilitate an individual’s ability to synchronize their brain’s activity with changes in a speech signal. This novel type of neurofeedback, based on phase coherence of the neural oscillatory activity with speech, will allow us to detect and enhance language function. It capitalizes on our recent research on neural oscillations during speech processing, where we found reduced auditory tracking in delta band in dyslexic readers compared with controls, advocating impaired auditory processing in dyslexia. Thus, our work and related findings suggest that literacy skills in dyslexics will improve by means of neurofeedback training protocols that enhance brain-speech tracking capabilities, especially in noisy environments. OsciLang will help to sustainably enhance brain-speech synchronization strength by allowing participants to shape their neural activity while tracking speech. This will be accomplished by presenting participants with a simple and friendly interface that quantifies basic parameters of their brain activity in real time, measured via EEG. This information can then be used by participants to facilitate top-down control on specific activation patterns. Based on our prior findings, OsciLang’ algorithms will be monitoring phase coherence at theta and delta bands, an innovative approach that has yet to be implemented in a neurofeedback system. Oscilang will also lay the foundations for extending this novel approach to provide a general framework and technology for enhancing any individual’s ability to learn to read.",

        "**Title: \"Unraveling the Complexity of Legislative Design: A Comparative Analysis\"**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe art of crafting effective legislation is a cornerstone of democratic governance, yet our understanding of the intricate dynamics involved remains limited in the face of increasingly polarized politics. This project seeks to bridge this knowledge gap by applying cutting-edge computational methods to analyze legislative texts in three distinct political systems: the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union. By exploring three key research questions, we aim to shed light on the conceptual dimensions that shape the design of laws, the factors driving variability in legislative design across domains and systems, and the determinants of a law's long-term stability. Our approach centers on two novel analytical dimensions – versatility and precision – allowing for the first time a systematic comparison of legislative substance across domains, systems, and time. The project's three primary contributions include a pioneering conceptual framework, an integrated theoretical model of legislative creation and survival, and a groundbreaking methodological approach to computational analysis of legislative content. By illuminating the complexities of legislative design, our research aims to enhance the theoretical foundations of comparative public policy and advance the study of democratic decision-making."

Given the increasingly hostile political climate around the world, solving this task has never been more difficult and more important than today. Yet, despite the crucial relevance of laws for our daily lives and the legitimacy and effectiveness of democratic government, our understanding of how the design, creation and long-term survival of legislation are related is still very limited. The DEMOLAW project analyses legislative texts in three different political systems (US, UK, EU) with cutting-edge computational methods to answer three major research questions: (1) Which conceptual dimensions capture the design of a law and how can we exploit textual properties of law texts to measure these dimensions empirically? (2) Why does the design of democratic legislation vary across laws, policy domains and political systems? (3) How can we explain why some laws are entirely stable over time, while others are constantly adjusted and sometimes transformed fundamentally? The project makes three major contributions. First, it provides an entirely novel conceptual perspective on the design of democratic laws by focusing on two analytical dimensions that are central to any piece of legislation: versatility and precision. This innovative approach allows us, for the first time, to measure and compare the substance of legislative output across and within policy domains, political systems and over time. Second, the project will develop and test an integrated theoretical framework on both the creation and the survival of democratic legislation and thereby advance the theoretical state-of-the-art in comparative public policy. Finally, the project’s ground-breaking methodological approach will pave the way for a computational analysis of legislative content and will thereby push the boundaries of how we study democratic decision-mak",

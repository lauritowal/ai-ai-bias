        "**Title:** Comparative Analysis of Charitable Food Provision in Urban Contexts: A Multimethod Approach\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nFood charities play a vital role in mitigating urban food insecurity, particularly in the wake of diminishing welfare benefits and the growing imperative for sustainable food systems. Despite their widespread presence, existing research lacks a comprehensive framework for comparing and understanding Charitable Food Provision (CFP) across diverse urban and national contexts. This project proposes to address this knowledge gap through a comparative analysis of CFP in multiple countries and cities, focusing on Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands.\n\nUsing a combination of event sequence analysis, mixed-methods social network analysis, and urban ethnography, this study will chart the historical development of CFP, examine current dynamics and interrelationships between providers and authorities, and investigate the role of CFP in poor people's survival strategies. The research will also develop an innovative tool for real-time data collection on urban CFP dynamics. By crafting a comprehensive framework for CFP comparison, this project aims to contribute new knowledge across multiple disciplines, including urban studies, sustainability, organization studies, food studies, and social policy. The insights gained will have important implications for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars seeking to understand and address urban food insecurity."

Their significance, particularly after the Great Recession, is underscored by two pivotal shifts: one towards the sustainable utilisation of food surplus and waste reduction, and the other reflecting societal changes with diminishing welfare benefit provision. While considerable research addresses food insecurity and support, the literature lacks a robust framework to understand and compare Charitable Food Provision (CFP) across countries and cities. Despite the almost universal occurrence of such transitions, existing studies have not yet contextualised this phenomenon within the diverse arrangements of welfare and civil society regimes, and the influence of transitions in agri-food sustainability on CFP. Accordingly, this proposal aims to: 1. Use event sequence analysis to chart the historical trajectory of CFP in Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, examining the emergence and consolidation of professionalised CFP sectors in diverse institutional settings. 2. Adopt mixed-methods social network analysis to examine current CFP dynamics in Palermo, Kyoto, and Rotterdam, focusing on providers interrelationships, operational modes, and their ties with both state and non-state authorities. 3. Harness urban ethnography to investigate the interdependence between food insecurity and support to understand how CFP becomes part of poor peopleâ€™s survival strategies. Additionally, it introduces an innovative tool, tailored for city workshops, to facilitate real-time data collection on (CFP) urban dynamics. Hence, it combines the findings obtained by crafting an overarching framework to extend CFP comparison to other countries and cities. The research will create new knowledge across urban, sustainability, organisation, food, and social policy studies, offering an innovative, comparative insight into food support and insecurity.",

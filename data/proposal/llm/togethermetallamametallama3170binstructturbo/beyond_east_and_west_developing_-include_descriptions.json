        "**Title:** Bridging East-West Musical Traditions: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Contemporary Music and Opera\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project seeks to overcome the challenges of integrating Turkey's rich musical heritage into contemporary concert music by developing practical processes and collaborative research methods. A series of cutting-edge workshops in Istanbul, Holland, and the UK will bring together top-level traditional instrumentalists, singers, and Western musicians to explore the intersection of Eastern and Western musical traditions.\n\nThe project aims to: 1) train Turkish musicians to perform new repertoire, 2) educate Western singers in non-Western vocal techniques, 3) develop approaches to model the impact of this music on musicians and audiences, 4) create an innovative ensemble interface for merging sounds, 5) conduct groundbreaking research on timbre, and 6) establish a new template for mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems.\n\nThe outcomes of this project will be compiled into a team-authored e-book, featuring audio and visual examples, which will serve as a comprehensive resource for composers and musicians seeking to integrate Turkish instruments and voices into contemporary music. This project's transdisciplinary approach also offers a model for exploring the creative potential of art to transcend cultural barriers and foster greater understanding."

But differences in tuning, texture, and between oral and notated orientations to performance have presented seemingly intractable obstacles. This project systematises practical processes essential for the creation of a new, East-West strand of contemporary music and opera. It initiates cutting-edge research workshops in Istanbul, Holland and the UK to: 1. Train top-level traditional instrumentalists and singers in Turkey effectively to perform a new repertoire; 2. Train top professional Western singers in non-Western techniques and nuances of vocal production; 3. Develop approaches for modelling such music's impacts on Turkish and Western musicians’ adaptive processes in rehearsal and performance, and diverse audiences’ perceptions of such music; 4. Create an ensemble interface (including newly designed instruments) to increase capacity for merging sounds beyond levels now achievable; 5. Produce groundbreaking studies on timbre to provide new insights into how sound is produced; 6. Establish a new template for mapping Eastern and Western tuning systems onto one another. This research, together with an orchestration manual for Turkish sounds will comprise the core of a published (CUP) team-authored e-book, Integrating Turkish Instruments and Voices into Contemporary Music (ITI), with included audio and visual examples linked as an online resource. Looking further, this project’s multi-modal, transdisciplinary approach also suggests a model for probing how the ‘free play’ of the imagination (Kant) possible within processes of art and its creation can provide metaphors towards understanding one of the most urgent and compelling issues of our time: how to transcend cultural barriers (real or imagined) that exist today.",

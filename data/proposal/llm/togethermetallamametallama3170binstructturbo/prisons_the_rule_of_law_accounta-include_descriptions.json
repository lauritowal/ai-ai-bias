        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nThis project seeks to investigate the lived experiences of accountability, rule of law, and human rights in European prisons. By examining how prisoners, prison staff, and oversight bodies perceive and interact with systems designed to ensure fairness and transparency, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex power dynamics at play in these institutions. Drawing on insights from public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, the project will employ a mixed-methods approach to capture the ways in which accountability structures are experienced and perceived.\n\nThe proposed research will challenge existing accounts of penal power and legitimacy, shedding new light on the ways in which judicial review, administrative action, and human rights are operationalized in prison settings. By analyzing the manifestation of penal ideologies and prison regimes in accountability structures, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the distinctive characteristics of European penal policy and practice. Ultimately, this research aims to inform the development of more effective and rights-respecting penal policies, supporting the protection of the rule of law and human rights in prisons across Europe."

Prisons are places where considerable power differentials exist, and are unique sites for the expression of the values which underpin public and prison law. Systems to ensure that prisoners are treated fairly and that rights are upheld are essential to ensure that imprisonment is conducted in ways that are just and promote good order. These are fundamental principles of the ‘European’ way in penal policy and penal law. Existing accounts of the deployment of penal power overlook key elements of how accountability, the rule of law, and rights are experienced. PRILA will document how prisoners, prison staff, staff of accountability bodies experience structures for ensuring decisions and actions taken in prison are fair, transparent, consistent, subject to appeal and review, and in compliance with principles of human rights. In doing so, PRILA will transform and extend accounts of legitimacy in prisons, judicial review of administrative action, the pains of imprisonment, and understandings of how penal power is experienced. Drawing on the disciplines of public and prison law, human rights, comparative law, and the sociology of punishment, the project will utilise legal, qualitative and quantitative research methods to create an account of how ‘accountability work’ is experienced. It will also examine how accountability structures are manifestations of penal ideologies or types of prison regimes. The project will advance current judicial and legal conceptions of accountability, the rule of law, and fairness, by reference to how these concepts are experienced in practice, and examine whether and how they are distinctively ‘European’. The project will thereby support the creation of better penal policies and practices aimed at the protection of the rule of law and rights in the prison context.",

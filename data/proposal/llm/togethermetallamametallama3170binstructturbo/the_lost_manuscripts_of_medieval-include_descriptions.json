        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project, LostMa, seeks to illuminate the complex dynamics of human cultural transmission through the lens of written cultural artifacts. By examining the copying, transformation, and destruction of manuscript texts, we aim to determine the degree to which their preservation or loss deviates from chance. Drawing inspiration from evolutionary biology and linguistics, we will apply stochastic processes and artificial intelligence to simulate the transmission of texts, shedding light on the role of human agency and chance in shaping cultural canons.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach combines philological expertise with complexity science and machine learning methods. A case study of chivalric literature in the European context will serve as the foundation for our investigation. We will collect and analyze a large corpus of 4000 documents in Romance, Germanic, and Celtic languages, with a focus on 1000 Old French manuscripts. By comparing simulation results with empirical data, we will quantify deviations from chance, infer non-observable values such as loss and survival rates, and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics driving textual transmission. This project aims to revolutionize our understanding of cultural heritage and the mechanisms that govern its preservation and transmission."

It strives to establish in what measure the transmission (and subsequent preservation or loss) of written artefacts, texts and ideas deviates from pure chance, and, if it deviates, by how much and why it does. It will do so by analysing the way that texts in manuscript form were copied, transformed or destroyed, in a similar way to the evolution of living organisms or of language variants, through process of innovation/mutation, fixation or extinction. As such, the goal of this project is not only to understand the processes behind the transmission of texts, but also to grasp the extent to which humans are the actors of the transmission of their own culture and how much the survival of texts or the constitution of cultural canons are due to chance. If this notion may seem provocative to humanities researchers, evolutionary biologists have long discovered the role of random drift in the survival or extinction of genetic traits and species. To investigate this question, this project will attempt a paradigm-shift in philological methods, by combining artificial intelligence, complexity science and philological expertise. Stochastic birth-and-death processes and computer multi-agent simulations will be used to emulate the process of textual transmission. A case study will be taken, regarding chivalric literature in European context. Supported by deep learning methods, large-scale data collection will be made on a corpus of 4000 documents in Romance, Germanic and Celtic languages, with a full-text zoom on approx. 1000 Old French manuscripts. Data will provide observable values to be compared to simulation results, in order to measure deviations from chance, make inferences on non observable values such as loss/survival rates of works and manuscripts, and understand the dynamics at work behind the transmission of texts.",

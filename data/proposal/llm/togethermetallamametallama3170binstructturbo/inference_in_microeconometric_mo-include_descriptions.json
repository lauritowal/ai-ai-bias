        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to develop novel inference methods for econometric models that account for unobserved differences between economic agents. Longitudinal data will be leveraged to address the challenges of modeling individual heterogeneity, a crucial aspect of economic outcomes such as education, wages, and employment duration. The proposed research is organized into three interconnected blocks, each tackling a significant gap in the existing literature. The first block focuses on enhancing the performance of statistical hypothesis tests for nonlinear models, addressing a critical limitation of current methods that primarily focus on point estimation. The second block aims to establish formal results for the estimation of network data models, which are increasingly recognized as essential for understanding social and economic connections. The third block will develop non-parametric estimation techniques for dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved heterogeneity and latent state variables, a crucial tool in labor economics and industrial organization. The proposed methods will be theoretically and empirically evaluated, with applications to labor force participation and international trade behavior. By reconciling heterogeneity in the data with econometric models, this project aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of economic outcomes and inform evidence-based policy decisions."

Allowing for such unobserved heterogeneity in economic modeling equips the specification with an additional dimension of realism but presents major challenges for econometric practice. Hence, reconciling heterogeneity in the data with econometric models is an issue of utmost importance. The aim of this project is to develop inference methods for models with unobserved heterogeneity by exploiting the identifying power of longitudinal (panel) data. The project consists of three blocks. Together, they span the largest part of modern applications of panel data. The first block deals with inference on nonlinear models and enhances the performance of statistical hypothesis tests. So far, the literature has focused on point estimation. However, it is statistical inference that accounts for uncertainty in the data and forms the basis for testing economic restrictions. The second block makes progress on the estimation of models for network data. The importance of social and economic connections is well established but few formal results are available. We exploit the fact that network data can be seen as a type of panel data to derive such results. The third block uses panel data to non-parametrically estimate dynamic discrete-choice models with unobserved type heterogeneity and/or latent state variables. Such results are inexistent even though dynamic discrete-choice models are a workhorse tool in labor economics and industrial organization. The performance of the tools will be assessed theoretically and via simulation, and they will be applied to various empirical problems. Two examples of applications that we will study are the extensive margin of labor force participation and the determinants of the import and export behavior of firms and countries.",

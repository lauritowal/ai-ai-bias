        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a novel framework for exploring the relationship between biological evolution and the transmission of cultural traits, specifically languages. Building on the pioneering work of Sokal and Cavalli Sforza, we aim to overcome the limitations of existing language classification methods by employing a cutting-edge comparative approach based on grammatical evidence. This method, founded on recent advances in formal and typological linguistics, ensures enhanced testability and replicability, enabling the measurement of linguistic distances between distant populations. By combining this innovative linguistic approach with state-of-the-art genetic tools, including Snackbar Polymorphism genome-wide studies and biostatistical analysis, we will investigate the correlation between linguistic and genetic diversity. A collaborative team of linguists and biologists will jointly select populations for language and gene sampling, ensuring a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach. This project has the potential to redefine our understanding of the interplay between biological and cultural evolution, shedding new light on the history of human populations and languages."

Sokal (1988) and Cavalli Sforza et. al. (1988, 1994) advocated a correspondence between some proposed language families and classical genetic markers, i.e. between biological evolution and transmission of cultural traits (languages), in agreement with Darwin’s (1859) prediction of an eventual isomorphy between trees of languages and populations. Their conclusions were variously criticised, and are especially undermined by the weakness of available language classification methods, mainly based on lexical (in a broad sense) material: these are either too narrow in scope (classical method) or probabilistically unreliable (Greenberg’s mass comparison) to provide solid long-range taxonomies to be matched against those of geneticists. We will address such issues with a radically new comparative method (Longobardi and Guardiano 2009) based entirely on grammatical evidence and on recent theoretical advances in formal and typological linguistics. The method ensures unprecedented standards of testability/replicability and can measure linguistic distances between even remote populations. Linguists and biologists will for the first time jointly select the populations most significant from either perspective for language/gene sampling. We will also adopt the newest powerful genetic tools of the last decade, both in terms of data (genome-wide studies of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, including uniparentally transmitted markers of the Y chromosome and of mitochondrial DNA) and of biostatistical methods to describe DNA diversity and interpret its relationships to linguistic diversity.",

        "**Abstract:**\n\nA surge in initiatives is set to expand internet access to remote regions worldwide over the next five years, leveraging novel technologies to reach the world's poorest populations, particularly in Africa. While recent debates focus on technical improvements and the potential of technology to 'liberate' populations, this project addresses a pressing, yet overlooked concern: the impact of increased social media access on the dynamics between peacebuilding efforts and violence perpetuation in conflict-affected communities. Focusing on Africa, specifically Eastern Africa, this research will explore the intersection of social media and conflict at macro, meso, and micro levels. Three primary research questions will guide the investigation: How do social media influence transnational conflict and peacebuilding dimensions? How do public authorities respond to and utilize social media to promote peace or violence? And, how do social media alter individual experiences and responses to violent conflict? By examining these questions in the context of online hate speech, conflict migration patterns, and governance actors' social media strategies, this project will provide crucial insights into the complex relationships between social media, conflict, and peacebuilding in Africa."

While previous efforts to expand Internet access have focused on urban areas, current initiatives are leveraging new technologies from drones to satellites to provide affordable access to the worlds poorest, many of whom are in Africa and live in regions where the state is weak and there is protracted violent conflict. Current debates have largely focused on technical issues of improving access, or assumed ways that technology will help ‘liberate’ populations or improve governance. This project focuses on a key puzzle that is often overlooked: How does increased access to social media affect the balance between peace-building efforts and attempts perpetuate violence in conflict-affected communities? With a focus on Africa (and particularly on religious and political violence in Eastern Africa), this project will investigate the relationship between social media and conflict through three research questions at the macro, meso and micro level: how are social media altering the transnational dimensions of conflict and peacebuilding? How are public authorities reacting to, and appropriating, social media to either encourage violence or promote peace? And in what ways are social media changing the way people experience, participate in, or respond to violent conflict? It will examine these questions in the context of dangerous speech online; the exit and entry of individuals away from, and into, conflict; the tactics and strategies actors adopt to shape the Internet; and how governance actors are leveraging social media in conflict-affected communities.",

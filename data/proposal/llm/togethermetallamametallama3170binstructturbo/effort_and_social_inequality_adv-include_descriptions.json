        "Abstract:\n\nThis project seeks to advance our understanding of the relationship between social inequality and cognitive effort. Despite extensive research on the determinants of cognitive abilities, there is limited knowledge on how effort varies across different socioeconomic backgrounds. This study aims to address this gap by investigating three key research questions: (1) the extent to which children's effort levels differ by parental socioeconomic status, (2) the factors driving these disparities, including intergenerational transmission of effort and varying motivations, and (3) the effectiveness of different methods for measuring cognitive effort.\n\nTo answer these questions, the project will employ innovative methodologies, including real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques such as pupillometry, to collect experimental data from a large sample of school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany. The study will also analyze subjective effort dispositions using international surveys. By triangulating these methodologies, the project will provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort and shed light on the implications for educational practice and policy design. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of intergenerational mobility and the promotion of equality of opportunity."

While large-scale test programs like PISA have produced impressive amounts of data on the determinants of cognitive abilities, there is scant evidence on socio-economic differences in cognitive effort. Better understanding the social origins of effort pushes the frontier of knowledge on intergenerational mobility and allows improving equality of opportunity. Specifically, the aim of the project is to answer three research questions: 1. To what extent do childrenâ€™s effort levels differ by parental socioeconomic background? (descriptive component) 2. Can existing disparities in effort by social background be explained by (a) the intergenerational transmission of effort from parents to children, and (b) varying motivations and differential susceptibility to incentives? (analytical component) 3. What are the best techniques to measure cognitive effort and what are the strengths and weaknesses of measures routinely used in different scientific disciplines? (methodological component) The project will develop and exploit cutting-edge methods of effort measurement such as real-effort tasks and psychophysiological techniques like pupillometry. Their immense potential has remained untapped in inequality research thus far. Experimental data will be collected for a large sample of school-age children and their parents in Spain and Germany. Subjective effort dispositions will be further analyzed using (inter)national surveys. The triangulation of carefully chosen methodologies will provide the first reliable evidence on socioeconomic differences in effort and stimulate new research (e.g. on gender or ethnic differentials in effort). Cross-validation analysis will detect possible biases of commonly used effort measures. The research findings will provide valuable insights for educational practitioners and decisive evidence for normative debates about social inequality and policy design.",

        "**Title: Unraveling the Bantu Expansion: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Understanding Ancient Migration and Subsistence**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe Bantu Expansion remains a contentious and pivotal event in Late Holocene African history, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of linguistic, cultural, and demographic shifts across the continent. Despite its significance, many questions persist regarding the movement and subsistence strategies of ancestral Bantu speakers. This project seeks to address these gaps through an innovative, interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in African archaeology, archaeobotany, and historical linguistics.\n\nOur research team will conduct fieldwork in previously unexplored regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, and Angola to identify and date the earliest Bantu-speaking village communities, and examine their interactions with indigenous hunter-gatherer groups. By integrating archaeobotanical, palaeoenvironmental, and lexical reconstruction approaches, we will reconstruct the subsistence patterns, diets, and habitats of these early villagers. Furthermore, our project will incorporate archaeozoological, genetic, and phylogenetic modeling data to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between human migration, language spread, climate change, and early farming in Late Holocene Central Africa.\n\nBy pushing the boundaries of current methodologies and fostering interuniversity collaboration, this project aims to shed new light on the Bantu Expansion and its enduring impact on African history and culture."

It is also one of the most controversial issues in African History that still has political repercussions today. It has sparked debate across the disciplines and far beyond Africanist circles in an attempt to understand how the young Bantu language family (ca. 5000 years) could spread over large parts of Central, Eastern and Southern Africa. This massive dispersal is commonly seen as the result of a single migratory macro-event driven by agriculture, but many questions about the movement and subsistence of ancestral Bantu speakers are still open. They can only be answered through real interdisciplinary collaboration. This project will unite researchers with outstanding expertise in African archaeology, archaeobotany and historical linguistics to form a unique cross-disciplinary team that will shed new light on the first Bantu-speaking village communities south of the rainforest. Fieldwork is planned in parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Angola that are terra incognita for archaeologists to determine the timing, location and archaeological signature of the earliest villagers and to establish how they interacted with autochthonous hunter-gatherers. Special attention will be paid to archaeobotanical and palaeoenvironmental data to get an idea of their subsistence, diet and habitat. Historical linguistics will be pushed beyond the boundaries of vocabulary-based phylogenetics and open new pathways in lexical reconstruction, especially regarding subsistence and land use of early Bantu speakers. Through interuniversity collaboration archaeozoological, palaeoenvironmental and genetic data and phylogenetic modelling will be brought into the cross-disciplinary approach to acquire a new holistic view on the interconnections between human migration, language spread, climate change and early farming in Late Holocene Central Africa.",

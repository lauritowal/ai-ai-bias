        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking research project aimed at understanding the complexities of domestic energy deprivation in post-socialist Eastern and Central Europe (ECE). Despite rising energy prices and inefficient housing, current scholarship and policy approaches often oversimplify the issue, focusing solely on income and energy efficiency. Our project, \"Understanding Energy Vulnerability in Post-Socialist Cities,\" will adopt a comprehensive energy vulnerability framework to examine the multifaceted causes, characteristics, and consequences of energy poverty in ECE's urban areas.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods comparative study of eight urban districts in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and North Macedonia, we will investigate how institutional structures, urban planning, and daily practices shape energy vulnerability. Our research will provide a nuanced understanding of the social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty, ultimately informing the development of effective technical and institutional solutions for affordable, clean, and efficient energy services in transitioning urban areas. By addressing energy poverty, our project can contribute to climate change mitigation and improve the well-being of millions of urban households in ECE."

The limited body of scholarship and policy tends to conceptualize domestic energy deprivation in ECE through the narrow lens of incomes and energy efficiency. The purpose of this project is to radically transform the state of the art in the field by undertaking the first comprehensive investigation of the multiple social and spatial dimensions of energy poverty in the grain of the post-socialist city. The project will use an energy vulnerability framework to explore the causes, character and consequences of domestic energy deprivation in ECE. Energy vulnerability can be seen as the propensity of a household to experience a lack of socially- and materially-necessitated energy services in the home. EvalUaTE will investigate the manner in which institutional structures, built tissues and everyday practices shape urban energy vulnerability. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, the project will achieve its aims by undertaking a comparative study of eight urban districts within Gda≈Ñsk (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary) and Skopje (FYR Macedonia). The knowledge gained from the project can potentially lead to the improvement of existing, or establishment of new, technical and institutional frameworks for the provision of affordable, clean and efficient energy services in transitioning urban areas, ultimately aiding climate change mitigation.",

        "**Abstract:**\n\nTransforming global food systems is critical for achieving sustainable development, mitigating climate change, and protecting human health. Despite progress in reducing hunger, the environmental and health impacts of food systems continue to worsen. This project seeks to drive a fundamental shift in agri-food production, trade, and consumption by generating evidence-based solutions for sustainable and healthy food systems. Through an integrated analysis of global food systems, the project will (1) assess the environmental and health outcomes of food production and consumption, (2) identify key drivers of unsustainability, and (3) develop targeted interventions using advanced modelling techniques. By adopting a systemic approach and interdisciplinary framework, this project aims to overcome existing barriers and provide actionable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and stakeholders. With a global scope and a strong foundation in interdisciplinary research, this project is poised to make a significant impact on the transformation of food systems, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future."

While hunger has receded, food systems are causing increasingly severe damage to our environment and health. The FLORA project will contribute to a transformation of global agri-food production, trade, and consumption necessary to achieve sustainable and healthy food systems. The project will create essential evidence to identify and implement the shifts in practices and behaviours needed to effectively achieve this transformation, by (1) making a diagnosis of the integrated health and environmental outcomes of food systems globally, from the production and consumption perspectives, with innovative measures of sustainability, (2) identifying key threats and opportunities with system dynamics and complex network analyses, and (3) targeting and evaluating tailored solutions with an inter-disciplinary modelling framework. The project will enable the identification of most effective, targeted solutions by considering trade-offs, synergies, and dynamics of key food systems components. Global in scope, it sets the ambitious goal to overcome barriers in current approaches by taking a systemic approach and establishing a robust, interdisciplinary framework supported by empirical advancements to tackle complex food systems challenges. This innovative project builds on the PIâ€™s excellent track record in leading interdisciplinary research focused on the global agri-food system and its environmental impacts.",

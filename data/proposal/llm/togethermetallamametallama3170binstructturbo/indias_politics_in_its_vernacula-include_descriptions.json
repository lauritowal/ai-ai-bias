        "Title: Deciphering India's Demotic Politics: A Vernacular Lexicography and Concept Laboratory\n\nAbstract:\n\nDespite India's position as the world's largest democracy, the conceptual underpinnings of its political landscape remain poorly understood. This project seeks to rectify this knowledge gap by examining the vernacular languages and ideas that shape ordinary Indian citizens' engagement with politics. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining anthropology, history, linguistics, and politics, this study will develop a vernacular lexicography of Indian politics and create an online Concept Laboratory. Inspired by the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, this project aims to: (1) establish a comprehensive understanding of India's demotic political ideas; (2) create a publicly accessible online platform for exploring Indian political languages; and (3) engage scholars of European political ideas to integrate the findings into global political theory. By doing so, this project will break new ground in subcontinental politics, extend methodological insights beyond Europe, and contribute to the development of a more inclusive global political theory grounded in diverse realities."

Much has been written about political ideas and institutions imported from Europe. And yet no focused, consecutive effort has gone into understanding the ideas that guide most ordinary Indian citizens’ engagement in their political lives. Analyses conducted through Euro-American categories and theoretical frames elevated to the status of universals – rights, identity, public sphere, secularism or indeed ‘politics’ – only generate paradoxes. This project will be a pioneering exploration of India’s demotic political ideas, which it will examine through a close ethnographic and historical scrutiny of the vernacular languages of its political life. Bringing together a team of anthropologists, historians, linguists and scholars of politics, and taking inspiration from the Begriffsgeschichte inquiry into German political concepts, it will (1) lay the empirical and analytical groundwork for a vernacular lexicography of India’s political life; (2) develop an online, open-access Concept Laboratory of Indian Political Languages; and (3) explore with scholars of European political ideas the implications of this work for global political theory. Drawing on the PI’s established work on the demotic categories and values in Indian politics, the project will break major new ground in the study of subcontinental politics; extend the methodological insights of the Begriffsgeschichte project beyond Europe; and make analytical advances towards a truly global political theory, grounded not in the analytical lingua franca of Western political theory, but in the realities of political life around the globe.",

        "**Title: Investigating Strategic Interactions in the Economics of Information Services**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks to advance our understanding of the economics of information services by examining the complex strategic interactions among agents involved in their production and exchange. A key focus of this research is the role of externalities, which are increasingly prevalent in information services due to their network effects, public good nature, and complementarity with physical infrastructure. The project is structured around four interconnected components. First, we will develop novel theoretical frameworks, incorporating global games, coordination games, and contract theory, to analyze two-sided markets and network dynamics. Second, we will investigate specific issues in the virtual layer, including the design of recommendation systems, privacy concerns, and transaction costs, using a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches. Third, we will examine the physical layer, focusing on pricing and investment decisions in the context of net-neutrality and the interplay between infrastructure and service innovation. Finally, we will develop tools and recommendations for competition policy makers to effectively regulate two-sided markets. By exploring these critical aspects of the economics of information services, this project aims to inform policy and business decisions, ultimately promoting more efficient and equitable information markets."

In this context, externalities play a key role explored by this proposal. Their increasing prevalence in information services can be traced to three features: - Many information services involve one-sided or two-sided network externalities. - Information is a public good and the production and exchange of information between two parties may affect other parties in a positive or negative manner. - Information services and physical infrastructures are complements. Externalities arise in the two layers of the information society, the content level and the physical infrastructure. The proposal is then organized around four parts: 1. Background theory: two-sided markets, network dynamics, contractual externalities 2. Virtual layer: recommendation systems, privacy, transaction costs 3. Physical layer: pricing , investment 4. Competition policy for two-sided markets The first part consists of the development of relevant theory with original and novel methods including for instance global games, coordination games and recent contract theory. The second part studies specific issues in information services such as the design of search engines and the right to privacy. It also includes empirical investigation of on-line transaction costs using proprietary data of transactions on e-commerce platforms. The third part is concerned with the infrastructure. It studies net-neutrality and the prices of data from the perspective of price theory, accounting for the gratuity of some services. It will also develop original dynamic investment models to understand the role of the complementarity between infrastructure and service innovation and the role of legacy. The last part will develop tools for competition policy makers.",

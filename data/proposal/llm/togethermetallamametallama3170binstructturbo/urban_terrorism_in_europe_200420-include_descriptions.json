        "**Abstract:**\n\nIn the wake of devastating terrorist attacks, European cities are grappling with the aftermath and preparing for potential future threats. This project proposes a comprehensive, comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to urban terrorism in four countries severely impacted by recent violence: Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. By integrating insights from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and anthropology, our research will explore the diverse voices and perspectives shaping contemporary debates on urban terrorism in Europe. We aim to (1) examine how collective forms of remembering, forgetting, and imagining have transformed urban spaces in the aftermath of attacks; (2) develop a novel materialist framework to critically assess local and European policies and security infrastructures; and (3) employ performance art as a creative tool to envision alternative forms of remembrance and future possibilities. Outputs will include a research website, academic publications, and public performances designed to spark critical debates about securitization processes in Europe. By challenging prevailing narratives and exploring innovative approaches to memory and security, this project seeks to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing conversation about urban terrorism and its impact on European cities."

Whilst trying to come to terms with recent acts of urban terrorism, governments, security agencies, and local communities are bracing themselves for further attacks. UrbTerr will offer the first in-depth comparative analysis of memory discourses and responses to recent acts of urban terrorism in four European countries that have suffered particularly as a result of this wave of violence: Spain, the UK, France, and Germany. Drawing on concepts and methods from memory studies, cultural studies, feminist theory and anthropology, UrbTerr will document and analyse a range of voices in contemporary debates on urban terrorism in Europe and problematise the narrow concept of imagination and creativity underpinning recent counter-terrorism measures and a great part of the academic literature on this subject. It will: (1) analyse the collective forms of forgetting, remembering, and imagining that have shaped urban spaces in the four countries after recent terrorist attacks; (2) develop a new materialist approach to terrorism and use this framework to critically assess policies and material security infrastructures that were created in response to these attacks at a local and European level; (3) use performance art as a creative tool to develop and experiment with alternative forms of remembering and different visions of the future. Outputs of the project will include a website with footage of interviews with city residents, politicians, architects, political activists, and other key actors, as well as other resources for terrorism research, two academic monographs, articles in peer-reviewed journals, a co-edited volume, two PhD theses, and a series of thought-provoking public performances by the art group ‘Center for Political Beauty’ that will spark critical debates about securitization processes in contemporary Europe.",

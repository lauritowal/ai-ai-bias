        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nTitle: Establishing a Social Demography of Widowhood: Understanding Risk, Vulnerability, and Consequences\n\nAs the global population ages, the prevalence of widowhood is increasing, yet research in this area remains underdeveloped. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a comprehensive social demography of widowhood. By integrating innovative conceptual and methodological approaches, our research will examine the risk and vulnerability associated with widowhood, focusing on both the probability and duration of this life event, as well as its mental health and economic consequences. A key aspect of this study is the consideration of the often-overlooked process of expected widowhood, which may have more significant and lasting impacts than the shorter process of unexpected widowhood.\n\nOur research will investigate social inequalities in widowhood by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity, nativity, social support networks, gender, and age, as well as country differences and changes over time. Using high-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data from up to 60 ageing countries, we will apply advanced statistical methods to provide systematic and comprehensive estimates of risk and vulnerability. The findings of this study will inform the development of sustainable pension and elder care systems, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the challenges facing a growing widowed population and their family members. By addressing the knowledge gap in widowhood research, this project will have significant implications for policy and practice."

Although the frequency of this high risk event is increasing across ageing societies, many countries have cut survival benefits exposing more bereaved spouses to dire short- and long-term consequences. Despite its growing relevance, widowhood research remains underdeveloped compared to other disruptive events, such as divorce. This ground-breaking research moves beyond the state-of-the-art in at least four ways to establish a social demography of widowhood. (1) The foundation of my project lies in an innovative conceptual and methodological approach to the risk and vulnerability to widowhood. While risk aims at the probability and duration of widowhood, vulnerability focuses on its mental health and economic consequences. Current assessments of widowhood effects are limited to change in wellbeing directly after bereavement with a special focus on unexpected deaths. However, the most prevalent scenario entails a process of terminal health decline in the years before death. The consequences of the often neglected longer process of expected widowhood may be larger than the shorter process of unexpected widowhood. Three ground-breaking pillars build on risk and vulnerability to examine (2) social inequalities by socioeconomic status, race-ethnicity and nativity, social support networks, gender and age, as well as (3) country differences and (4) change over time. High-quality cross-sectional and longitudinal data sources will be harmonized and applied to an advanced set of statistical methods for up to 60 ageing countries varying in demographic trends and welfare systems from 1985 with projections to 2050. A social demography of widowhood will supplement fragmented evidence with systematic and comprehensive estimates on risk and vulnerability, provide insights into the challenges facing a growing widowed population and their family members, and facilitate new research on sustainable pension and elder care systems.",

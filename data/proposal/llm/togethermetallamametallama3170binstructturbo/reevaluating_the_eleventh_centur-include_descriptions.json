        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nTitle: \"Rethinking Historical Data: A Novel Framework for Medieval History\"\n\nThis project seeks to revolutionize the way digital data about historical phenomena is created, curated, and analyzed. By reframing existing and new historical data as assertions linked to authorities, we aim to develop a methodology that acknowledges the complexity and nuance of historical knowledge. This approach recognizes that historical facts are often disputed and context-dependent, particularly in pre-modern history. Our goal is to create a framework that allows for the manipulation and contextualization of historical data, enabling historians to better understand the relationships between different assertions and sources.\n\nWe will test this methodology by applying it to a critical period in medieval history, focusing on the late 11th century (c. 1030-1095) and the eastern half of Christendom. By incorporating developments from across Europe, particularly in newly Christianized kingdoms, we will uncover trans-regional trends of communication and contact that have been obscured by traditional narratives. By leveraging the wealth of digital resources and scholarship in sub-disciplines such as prosopography, textual scholarship, and archaeology, we will create a rich and multifaceted understanding of this pivotal period in history. Ultimately, our project will provide a new framework for analyzing historical data, enabling historians to approach complex historical phenomena from multiple perspectives."

The approach is to re-frame both existing and new historical data as assertions, often sourced but always linked to an authority; this allows data to be manipulated according to source and authority, and also allows assertions themselves to be linked depending on whether they corroborate, depend on, or conflict with each other. The novel aspect of this methodology is that it takes to its logical conclusion something that historians all readily acknowledge and that is especially apparent for pre-modern history: that there are very few, if any, simple and undisputed facts. A related challenge is the contextualisation and reuse of existing online data for the period, to avoid its going to waste. The approach is tested by taking a broad trans-regional approach to the history of the late 11th century (c. 1030–1095), centred broadly in the eastern half of Christendom but incorporating developments elsewhere, especially in the newly Christianised kingdoms of central Europe. The looming weight of the First Crusade at the century's end means that while certain regional or proto-national narratives—particularly for western Europe—are well-developed, they tend to obscure the larger trans-regional trends of communication and contact, particularly in eastern Christendom. By drawing upon the depth of scholarship and the plethora of digital resources that have emerged for this period in sub-disciplines such as prosopography, textual scholarship, corpus-based research, and archaeology, and by framing this scholarship in terms of assertions whose authority is traceable, it will become possible to look at the history not just from \"the eastern perspective\", but from several.",

        "Title: Unpacking the Dynamics of Climate Justice Norms: An Interdisciplinary Study of Loss and Damage Policy\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project seeks to illuminate the complex processes driving the emergence and evolution of climate justice norms, focusing on the pivotal issue of loss and damage related to climate change. Despite growing recognition of the urgent need to address the irreparable consequences of climate change, there is significant disagreement over the meaning and implications of loss and damage policy among international stakeholders, states, and affected communities. Through an innovative blend of interdisciplinary theory and ethnographic methodology, this study will investigate the conditions under which climate justice norms gain traction, face contestation, or undergo transformation. By examining the intricate interplay between international negotiations, national policy implementation, and domestic practices, this research aims to demonstrate how policy-making and implementation shape the fluid content of climate justice norms. The project will also make a methodological contribution by refining political ethnography and practice-tracing methods, providing a nuanced understanding of the dynamic relationships between policy practices and norm evolution."

Yet we have limited understanding of why some norms emerge and gain traction globally whereas others do not. The politics of loss and damage related to climate change offers a paradigm case for studying the emergence of - and contestation over - norms, specifically justice norms. The parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have recently acknowledged that there is an urgent need to address the inevitable, irreversible consequences of climate change. Yet within this highly contested policy area - which includes work on disaster risk reduction; non-economic losses (e.g. loss of sovereignty); finance and climate-related migration - there is little consensus about what loss and damage policy means or what it requires of the global community, of states and of the (current and future) victims of climate change. Relying on an interdisciplinary theoretical approach and an ethnographic methodology that traverses scales of governance, my project - The Politics of Climate Change Loss and Damage (CCLAD) - will elucidate the conditions under which a norm is likely to become hegemonic, influential, contested or reversed by introducing a new understanding of the fluid nature of norm-content. I argue that norms are partly constituted through the practices of policy-making and implementation at the international and national level. The research will examine the micro-politics of the international negotiations and implementation of loss and damage policy and also involves cross-national comparative research on domestic loss and damage policy practices. Bringing these two streams of work together will allow me to show how and why policy practices shape the evolution of climate justice norms. CCLAD will also make an important methodological contribution through the development of political ethnography and “practice-tracing” methods.",

        "**Grant Proposal Abstract:**\n\nThe healthcare industry, particularly hospitals, is grappling with issues of waste and disposability in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing solutions often rely on technological innovation and circular economies, but this project, The Upcycled Clinic, takes a different approach by focusing on creative practices such as repurposing in clinical settings. Through an ethnographic study of five diverse case studies across the globe, including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S., and the U.K., our team of researchers will investigate how healthcare professionals and support staff creatively engage with materials to address shortages and waste.\n\nBy conducting in-depth fieldwork, interviews, and analyzing open datasets, we aim to identify the conditions that foster or hinder creative material engagement in clinical settings. This research will contribute to the social study of medicine in three key areas: (1) shifting the focus of hospital ethnographies from patient encounters to material cultures, (2) providing the first globally-oriented study of improvisation in clinical settings, and (3) developing innovative methodological approaches to reusing and sharing research materials.\n\nOur study will offer practical insights into how healthcare can harness creativity to address waste and shortages, ultimately informing policies and practices that promote local, sustainable solutions. By exploring the intersection of materiality, resilience, and innovation in clinical settings, this project will advance our understanding of the complex relationships between healthcare, waste, and creativity."

Hospitals in particular have become nodes of disposability. Solutions to this problem has to date attracted mostly the attention of medical technology companies promoting circular economies, a model still reliant on production and technological innovation. The Upcycled Clinic takes a different direction. This ethnographic project focuses on creative practices such as repurposing in the clinic, involving making the most of existing materials. Five sub-projects have been carefully selected with illuminating examples around the world including Antarctica, Ghana, the Netherlands, the U.S and U.K. A team of ethnographers will conduct fieldwork and interviews with a range of actors, many often overlooked, such as cleaners and laundry staff, and look at open datasets of pandemic improvisations. The overarching objective is, through comparison, to better understand conditions which cultivate and curtail creative material engagement in the clinic. This inventive and timely contribution to the social study of medicine will advance the field in at least three directions. First, by attending more closely to materials, it moves hospital ethnographies beyond current focus on the patient encounter. Second, it will offer the first globally orientated study of improvisation in the clinic. Third, it breaks new methodological ground in the social sciences by developing novel ways of reusing and sharing research material in ethnography that adopts sensory methods and rethinks data waste. These contributions from the rich case of the clinic will add empirical insights to theories of materiality and help address long standing questions regarding resilience and innovation in the workplace. Practically, the study will articulate conditions under which healthcare can leverage creativity and pay better attention to local solutions to wastefulness and shortage.",

        "**Title: Rethinking Governance through Blockchain Technology: A Multidisciplinary Exploration**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThe decline of trust in traditional institutions and the rise of blockchain technology have created an opportunity to reassess the dynamics of power and governance in modern societies. This project proposes to investigate the impact of blockchain technology on existing and emerging governance structures, with a focus on its potential to foster transparency, accountability, and decentralized decision-making. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining computer science, political science, and law, we will analyze the governance of existing blockchain systems, evaluate the legitimacy and sustainability of distributed governance models, and design new architectures for participatory decision-making. Our research will also involve experimentation with these models at various levels of governance, from local communities to global institutions. By advancing the field of distributed governance, this project aims to provide groundbreaking insights and policy recommendations that can inform the development of more inclusive and effective governance systems. We seek funding to support a dedicated research team with diverse expertise, enabling us to pursue a high-risk, high-gain vision that can drive meaningful innovation in the field of governance."

Often described as a “trustless” technology, blockchain’s potential for disintermediation has been touted as a catalyst of innovation that could displace existing power structures. But is it shifting power away from former centers of power only to create new ones, or can it lead to an actual new organisation of power? BlockchainGov is an interdisciplinary project that will study the impact of blockchain technology on new and existing governance structures, and its consequences for legitimacy and trust. First, it will investigate the governance of existing blockchain systems, and analyse the power dynamics at play within these systems. Second, it will examine the legitimacy and long-term sustainability of existing attempts at distributed governance, through the lenses of legal and political theory. Third, it will explore the potential of blockchain technology to support new models of distributed governance providing an architecture for decentralized and participatory decision-making with attributes of transparency and accountability. Last, it will experiment with these new models at different levels of governance, from the community level to the global governance level. The project will open a new field of scholarship on “distributed governance” that uniquely combines the disciplines of computer science, political science and law. It will provide key empirical and theoretical contributions to science, with important policy implications to the broader questions of global governance. Bringing this project to life requires a funding scheme compatible with a high-risk/high-gain vision to finance a fully dedicated and highly motivated research team with multidisciplinary skills.",

        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis research proposal aims to investigate the impact of historical factors on conflict and economic development, with a particular focus on the role of institutions and human capital. By leveraging a novel dataset of administrative records on the first colonizers of Latin America (1492-1599), this study will reexamine the long-standing debate on the relationship between institutions and economic development. The dataset provides detailed information on the personal characteristics of settlers, their destinations in the Americas, and the institutional set-ups of different regions in Latin America during the early years of colonization.\n\nUsing within-country analysis, this research will examine the interplay between human capital and institutions in shaping economic development and conflict. Furthermore, the study will investigate the persistence of institutions over time, analyzing how the evolution of institutions during the first century of colonization influences their stability and impact on economic outcomes.\n\nIn a complementary line of inquiry, this project will also explore how ancient conflicts affect contemporary conflict dynamics. By constructing a dataset of historical conflicts using archaeological evidence, this research will analyze the long-run dynamics of conflict across regions, shedding light on the lasting impact of historical events on modern conflict patterns. This study seeks to contribute to our understanding of the complex relationships between history, institutions, human capital, and economic development, with implications for policy-making and conflict resolution."

Following the lead of the new institutional economics, part of the literature argues that institutions cause differences in productivity and factor endowments which, in turn, explain economic development. An alternative view assumes that human capital shapes institutional changes and, therefore, institutions are endogenous. In the first part of the project, which is the core of the research proposal, I will try to move one step further in this debate by taking an approach that uses administrative data on the first colonizers of Latin America. The data contain some personal characteristics on each of the settlers from 1492 to 1599 (town of origin in Spain, occupation, education, city of arrival in the Americas, etc). Using within-country analysis, since we have information on the precise destinations of the first “pobladores” (settlers), and the different institutional set-ups during the first years of colonization for different geographical areas in Latin America, I will reexamine the issue of institutions versus human capital in the explanation of economic development and conflict. The institutions in the initial times of colonization were not the same in all the regions of Latin America and, in many cases, represented an evolution of pre-Colombian institutions. The new data allows also the analysis of the interaction between human capital and institutions in the initial times. In addition the migrations and the evolution of institutions during the first century of colonization provide also some guidance for the research on the sources of institutional persistence. In the second part I plan to go further back in time to understand how very old conflicts influence current conflict. I will construct a dataset with the location of old conflicts using archaeological evidence to analyze the dynamics of conflict by regions in the very long run.",

        "**Title: Unraveling the Neural Mechanisms of Conscious Perception**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal seeks to elucidate the fundamental processes governing conscious perception, a long-standing enigma in modern neuroscience. Recent findings from our laboratory indicate that the conscious processing of simple visual stimuli is contingent upon the activation of the frontal cortex and the engagement of working memory. However, more complex stimuli necessitate a sustained interplay between the visual cortex and associative brain regions, involving scene segmentation and attentional mechanisms. To further elucidate the neural underpinnings of consciousness, we propose a comprehensive investigation of the neuronal fate of simple and complex visual stimuli that either enter or remain outside of conscious awareness. This will be achieved through the recording of single neuron activity in human epilepsy patients with implanted electrodes and in non-human primates using a novel, high-density recording technique. Functional imaging and perturbation methods will be employed to map the functional connectome and examine the brain regions that contribute to reportable experiences. By combining these innovative approaches, this study will provide unprecedented insights into the neural processes governing conscious perception, ultimately informing our understanding of this fundamental aspect of human experience."

Why are some visual stimuli consciously perceived, whereas others remain subliminal? What is the relation between conscious perception, attention and working memory? Recent work of my lab demonstrated that weak but simple stimuli can be reported once they elicit a minimal level of activity in the frontal cortex, which is related to the storage of the stimulus in working memory. For these simple stimuli, the visual cortex acts as a relay station that needs to pass the information to higher cortical areas. However, we found that the perception of more complex visual stimuli relies on a more sustained interaction between visual cortex and associative brain regions, related to scene segmentation and visual attention. These recent results pave the way for a genuine understanding of mechanisms for consciousness, inspiring new paradigms that assess the awareness of stimuli while varying the demands on attention and working memory. The present proposal will be the first to compare the neuronal fate of simple and complex stimuli that do and do not enter consciousness across most brain regions. We will measure the activity of single neurons in human patients who are implanted with electrodes as part of their treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. We will also use a new method that permits the recording from numerous single neurons within an entire hemisphere of a monkey and characterize neuronal activity in most regions of the cortex and subcortex. We will use perturbation methods at numerous locations throughout the brain in combination with functional imaging in monkeys to measure a “functional connectome” and to investigate the brain regions in which activity does (or does not) readily lead to a reportable experience. The proposed combination of experiments will provide unprecedented insight into how sensory stimuli give rise to conscious perception.",

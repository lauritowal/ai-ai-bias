        "**Abstract for Grant Proposal:**\n\nAs societies become increasingly diverse, the ability to coexist harmoniously with disparate groups has become a pressing concern. Intergroup tolerance, though crucial for maintaining social cohesion, remains an understudied concept in social psychology. This research aims to bridge the knowledge gap by investigating the social psychological aspects of intergroup toleration, where differences are accepted and endured. A comprehensive framework will be developed to elucidate the underlying psychological components of tolerance, including the objection, acceptance, and rejection aspects, as well as the consequences of being tolerated.\n\nCombining survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments utilizing EEG, this study will provide novel insights into the dynamics of intergroup toleration. By advancing our understanding of toleration, this research will inform the development of evidence-based initiatives and approaches that promote a more tolerant and inclusive society. Given the growing importance of cultural diversity and the lack of systematic research in this area, this project is both innovative and timely, offering a critical contribution to the field of social psychology."

In Europe, intergroup tolerance has been proposed as a key aspect of living harmoniously and productively with diversity; it is critical because objection and disagreement about what is good and right are inevitable. A diverse, egalitarian, and peaceful society does not require that we all like each other, but it does require that people at least tolerate one another. Yet, there has been very little by way of social psychological theorizing and systematic empirical research on intergroup toleration. This research will advance the state of the art in the social sciences by moving beyond intergroup stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination, and focusing on the social psychology of intergroup toleration in which differences are endured. This new line of research will unravel the interrelated aspects of toleration. We will elucidate: (1) the underlying psychological aspects of tolerance (the objection component), 2) the psychological processes underlying tolerance (the acceptance component), 3) the limits of tolerance (the rejection component), and 4) the social psychological consequences of being tolerated. This program has a coherent theoretical framework and empirically toleration will be examined by using a combination of survey data, framing experiments, and lab experiments involving EEG. The research will provide key insights into the social psychological dynamics of intergroup toleration. This can form the basis for developing and implementing initiatives and approaches that contribute to a more tolerant society. Given the contested nature of cultural diversity and the absence of systematic social psychological investigations, the proposed research is both ground-breaking and timely.",

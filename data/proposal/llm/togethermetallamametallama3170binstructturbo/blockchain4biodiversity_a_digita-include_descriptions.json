    "descriptions": [
        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis project aims to develop a digital platform, leveraging blockchain technology, to facilitate the equitable and transparent exchange of farmers' indigenous seeds and associated knowledge (ISK). The proposed platform, ReSeed, addresses the challenges of on-farm conservation of agrobiodiversity by providing a decentralized and immutable record of ISK transactions. This will enable the tracking of ISK from its source to its end use, fostering honest reporting and incentivizing the conservation and innovation of these valuable genetic resources.\n\nThrough a mixed-methods research approach, this project will engage with suppliers and buyers of ISK to co-compile technical features and incentives that inform the platform's design. The project will also explore the integration of ReSeed into international regulatory frameworks and develop a governance model, including ethics guidelines for its adoption in small farmers' communities.\n\nBy promoting in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, ReSeed seeks to acknowledge and add value to farmers' ISK, generating economic and environmental benefits for small farmers. Building on 12 years of research on incentivizing sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds, this project has the potential to make a significant contribution to global food security and sustainable agriculture."

While indigenous seeds can be preserved in seed banks, problems of viability over prolonged storage and rapid climate change necessitate on-farm (in situ) conservation. However, farmers face dwindling economic incentives to cultivate and thereby conserve ISK in situ: ISK is ineligible for protection under intellectual property laws and there are currently no systems in place for tracking the end use to which ISK are put (e.g. end-user consumption or downstream research). The fundamental problem here is in tracing who the first farmer (group) was that put an ISK on the “market”, who accessed it, and what was done with it. Using features of blockchain technology that can help track the flow of ISK in a decentralized, transparent and immutable way, my goal is to develop and test a technical specification for a first-of-its-kind digital farmers’ market (ReSeed) that (i) facilitates equitable and traceable transfers of farmers’ ISK, and (ii) incentivizes honest reporting-back of downstream research and innovation therewith. Using a mixed methods research approach, I will conduct original empirical research with suppliers and buyers of ISK to co-compile technical features and incentives that will inform ReSeed’s design. I will also demonstrate how ReSeed can be integrated into international regulatory frameworks with minimal legal amendments, and create a governance model, including ethics guidelines for its adoption and implementation in small farmers’ communities. ReSeed will build on my 12-year research on means of incentivizing sustainable innovations with indigenous seeds. It will promote in situ conservation, research, and innovation with agrobiodiversity, acknowledge and add value to farmers’ ISK, and bring economic and environmental benefits to small farmers.",

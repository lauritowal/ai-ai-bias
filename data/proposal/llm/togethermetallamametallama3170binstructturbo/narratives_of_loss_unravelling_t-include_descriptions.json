        "**Title: Unpacking Economic Hardship and Support for Socially Conservative Agendas**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis project explores the complex relationship between economic hardship and support for socially conservative policies restricting the rights of marginalized groups. Recent surges in prejudice and far-right support across Europe pose a significant threat to community cohesion. While economic crises often coincide with increased far-right support, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, this research proposes that economic hardship fosters specific narratives of loss, driving support for socially conservative agendas. An innovative, multi-method approach combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies will empirically test this hypothesis. A comparative analysis of five European countries with varying levels of economic hardship compensation – and local contexts within these countries – will provide a nuanced understanding of the role of policy context in shaping this relationship. This project aims to uncover the underlying dynamics driving support for socially conservative policies and inform strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of economic hardship on marginalized groups."

Many European societies have recently experienced growing prejudice towards marginalised groups and the rise in support for far-right parties advocating to restrict the rights of these groups. These developments threaten the cohesion of national and local communities across Europe. While aggregate level evidence suggests that financial crises generally coincide with increased support for far-right parties, we do not understand why this happens. By developing a groundbreaking interdisciplinary theoretical framework that integrates insights about the role of loss from political science, sociology, social psychology and behavioural economics, the LOSS project contends that experiences of economic hardship translate into specific narratives of loss that in turn trigger support for social conservative political agendas. To empirically examine the importance of narratives of loss, the LOSS project employs an innovative multi-method empirical approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. To uncover the role of context, the project compares five European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) that vary in the level of compensation provided for economic hardship, and local contexts within these countries.",

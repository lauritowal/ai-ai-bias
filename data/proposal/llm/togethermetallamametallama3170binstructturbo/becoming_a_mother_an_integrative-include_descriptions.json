        "**Title: Understanding Maternal Adaptations - A Longitudinal Study of Brain and Behavioral Changes**\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nThis proposal, \"Understanding Maternal Adaptations,\" aims to develop a comprehensive model of the biological and psychological adaptations that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period, crucial for the onset and maintenance of maternal behavior. Building on previous findings of pronounced reductions in cerebral gray matter volume in areas of the social-cognition network, this study will investigate the dynamics of brain changes, cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding, and psychiatric measures in pregnant women. A prospective longitudinal design will be employed, with five time points of data collection: pre-pregnancy, two intra-pregnancy sessions, and two postpartum sessions. Three groups of women will be studied: nulliparous women undergoing a full-term pregnancy, nulliparous women whose same-sex partners are undergoing a full-term pregnancy, and a control group of nulliparous women. Neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral, and metabolomics data will be acquired and analyzed within the Research Domain Criteria framework. The study will provide a longitudinal model of maternal adaptations, as well as intermediate evaluations and cross-sectional analyses. This innovative research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between biological, psychological, and environmental factors that shape maternal behavior, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions to support mothers and their infants."

We were the first group to find (1, 2) that pregnancy is associated with consistent, pronounced and long-lasting reductions in cerebral gray matter (GM) volume in areas of the social-cognition network. The aim of BEMOTHER is to develop an integrative model of the adaptations for motherhood that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period by: i) establishing when the brain of pregnant women begins to change and how it evolves; ii) characterizing the dynamics of cognitive performance, theory-of-mind, maternal-infant bonding and psychiatric measures; iii) assessing the effect of environmental and/or psychological factors in the maternal adaptations, iv) identifying the metabolomics biomarkers associated with maternal adaptations, and v) integrating the previous findings within the Research Domain Criteria framework (RDoC) (3). We will use a prospective longitudinal design at 5 time points (1 pre-pregnancy session, 2 intra-pregnancy sessions and 2 postpartum sessions) during which neuroimaging, psychological, behavioral and metabolomics data will be acquired in 3 groups of women: a group of nulliparous women who will be undergoing a full-term pregnancy, another group of nulliparous women whose same-sex partners will undergo a full-term pregnancy, and a group of control nulliparous women. We will provide the longitudinal RDoC-based model at the end of the study, but we will also deliver intermediate longitudinal evaluations after the postpartum session, as well as cross-sectional analyses after the first intra-pregnancy session and the postpartum session. BEMOTHER is timely and innovative. It adopts the translational RDoC framework in order to provide a pioneering, comprehensive and dynamic characterization of the adaptations for motherhood, addressing the interaction among different functional domains at different levels of analysis.",

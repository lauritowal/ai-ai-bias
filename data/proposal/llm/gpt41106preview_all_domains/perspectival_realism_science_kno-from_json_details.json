        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Perspectival Realism: Science, Knowledge, and Truth from a Human Vantage Point,\" aims to develop and substantiate the philosophical view of perspectival realism, a framework that contends scientific knowledge is inherently shaped by perspectives, yet can still attain truth and realism. Through a highly interdisciplinary approach, this project merges the philosophy of science, scientific practice, history of science, and history of philosophy, with a focus on application across the physical, life, and social sciences.\n\nThe project is structured around four main goals, each addressing pivotal questions in the discourse on perspectival realism. Goal 1 aims to systematically investigate how contemporary physicists engage with perspectival modeling, scrutinizing both non-perspectival methods in particle physics and the integration of diverse data sets in observational cosmology. Goal 2 examines historical case studies to explore the extent and impact of scientific controversies surrounding perspectival modeling, with a particular focus on measurement and experimental techniques. Goal 3 undertakes a re-assessment of the historical origins of perspectivism, highlighting the Enlightenment period and Kant's \"Copernican Revolution.\" Goal 4 elaborates on the metaphysical underpinnings required for a coherent perspectival realism, confronting the challenge of reconciling perspectivism with traditional notions of realism.\n\nThe methodology is innovative, encompassing five sub-projects that will be collaboratively pursued by a diverse team of physicists, historians of science, historians of philosophy, and philosophers of science. The anticipated outcome of the project is a scientifically and historically informed philosophical position that propels the debates on pluralism, unification, and realism forward within scientific research. By addressing the research questions through this multifaceted lens, the project has the potential to reshape our understanding of science as a human endeavor and to offer a nuanced perspective on how we comprehend and represent the world around us.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"Perspectival Realism. Science, Knowledge, and Truth from a Human Vantage Point,\" aims to forge a new philosophical stance on the nature of scientific knowledge by examining the concept of perspectival realism. This innovative, highly interdisciplinary approach engages philosophy of science, scientific practices, history of science, and history of philosophy to address critical issues across physical, life, and social sciences.\n\nThe central research questions driving this project are: Can scientific knowledge be both perspectival and true? How can we reconcile perspectivism with realism? Through five sub-projects, the research team will systematically investigate contemporary physicists' approaches to perspectival modeling, examine historical case studies of scientific controversies arising from perspectival modeling, re-assess the historical origins of perspectivism with a focus on the Enlightenment and Kant's 'Copernican Revolution,' and elaborate on the metaphysics necessary to support perspectival realism.\n\nThe project's goals are to provide a systematic investigation into non-perspectival methods in particle physics, the integration of diverse data sets in observational cosmology, the extent of scientific controversies due to perspectival modeling focusing on measurement and experimental techniques, and the compatibility of perspectivism with realism. This project promises to yield a scientifically and historically informed philosophical position that advances debates on pluralism, unification, and realism in scientific research.\n\nCollaborators include physicists, historians of science, historians of philosophy, and philosophers of science, who will contribute to creating a comprehensive philosophical position with the potential to impact our understanding of scientific theories and models from a human-centric perspective. The outcome will offer a fresh lens through which to view scientific endeavors, emphasizing the significance of perspective in the pursuit of knowledge and truth.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Perspectival Realism. Science, Knowledge, and Truth from a Human Vantage Point\" aims to develop a novel philosophical position known as perspectival realism, which contends that scientific knowledge can be both perspectival and true. This highly interdisciplinary endeavor integrates perspectives from the philosophy of science, scientific practice, history of science, and history of philosophy, applying its insights across the physical, life, and social sciences. \n\nThe research is structured around four main goals. The first goal involves a systematic investigation of how contemporary physicists employ perspectival modeling, focusing on the contrasting methodologies within particle physics and observational cosmology. The second goal examines historical case studies to understand the extent to which scientific controversies have been influenced by perspectival modeling, delving into disagreements over measurement and experimental techniques. The third goal entails a re-assessment of the historical origins of perspectivism, with an emphasis on the Enlightenment period and Kant's 'Copernican Revolution.' The final goal aims to elaborate a metaphysics that underpins perspectival realism, addressing the compatibility of perspectivism with realism.\n\nThe project will result in a scientifically and historically informed philosophical stance that advances debates on pluralism, unification, and realism in scientific research. This stance will be supported by an innovative methodology, divided into five sub-projects, involving collaboration from a multidisciplinary team of physicists, historians of science, historians of philosophy, and philosophers of science. By bridging these diverse fields, the project promises to yield a comprehensive philosophical position on how human perspectives shape and are shaped by scientific knowledge and truth.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe grant proposal titled \"Perspectival Realism: Science, Knowledge, and Truth from a Human Vantage Point\" seeks to develop a cutting-edge philosophical framework, perspectival realism, which reconciles the subjectivity inherent in scientific inquiry with the objective pursuit of truth. This highly interdisciplinary project bridges the gap between philosophy of science, scientific practice, history of science, and history of philosophy, with a focus on scientific perspectivism across the physical sciences, life sciences, and social sciences.\n\nThe research aims to resolve pressing questions such as whether scientific knowledge can be both perspectival and true, and if perspectivism is compatible with realism. The project's innovative methodology will unfold through five sub-projects, engaging collaborators from diverse disciplines including physicists, historians of science and philosophy, and philosophers of science.\n\nThe goals of the proposal include:\n1. Conducting a systematic investigation into how contemporary physicists handle perspectival modelling, exploring both non-perspectival methods in particle physics and the integration of different data sets in observational cosmology.\n2. Examining historical case studies to understand the extent of scientific controversies arising from perspectival modelling, with an emphasis on measurement and experimental techniques.\n3. Re-assessing the historical origins of perspectivism during the Enlightenment period, particularly focusing on Kant's 'Copernican Revolution'.\n4. Elaborating on a metaphysical framework that supports perspectival realism, answering whether perspectivism can coexist with an objective view of realism.\n\nThe outcome of this research is an innovative philosophical position that advances debates on pluralism, unification, and realism in scientific research. By fostering a scientifically and historically informed understanding of perspectival realism, this project has the potential to reframe our conception of scientific knowledge and truth from a human vantage point.\n\n(Word count: 273)"

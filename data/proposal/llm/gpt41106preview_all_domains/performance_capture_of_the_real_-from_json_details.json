        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Performance Capture of the Real World in Motion\" proposes a transformative approach to overcome the significant limitations of existing performance capture technologies. Current methods are confined to indoor studios with controlled lighting and rely on dense, static camera arrays. They often only capture single objects with limited shape detail and make simplistic assumptions about materials, reflectance, and lighting. Furthermore, the captured data is challenging to modify, restricting its practical use.\n\nThis project sets out to revolutionize the field by achieving several ambitious goals: capturing dynamic surface and texture models from multi-view video; reconstructing dynamic surface models with unprecedented shape detail; succeeding in general scenes both outdoors and outside of laboratory environments; handling scenes with complex material and reflectance distributions; operating in general, uncontrolled, and unknown lighting conditions; capturing dense and crowded scenes with complex shape deformations; and reconstructing scene models that are conveniently modifiable. Additionally, the project aims to function with sparse and moving sets of cameras, including the ubiquitous mobile phone, making high-quality performance capture accessible and practical.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this pioneering work include elevating performance capture from a research technology to a practical tool that can be utilized in a myriad of settings. The project promises to provide groundbreaking scientific insights into the nature of dynamic scene capture and to open up revolutionary new applications across various industries including entertainment, sports, healthcare, and virtual reality.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to support the development of these novel performance capture techniques, thereby making a significant leap forward in the field and offering substantial benefits to both the scientific community and the public at large.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Performance Capture of the Real World in Motion,\" aims to revolutionize the field of performance capture technology by overcoming existing constraints that have kept it confined to indoor studios with controlled lighting and dense camera arrays. Current methods are often limited to capturing single objects, provide only a limited reconstructed shape detail, and rely on simplistic assumptions about materials, reflectance, and lighting, which restricts their use in dynamic, real-world environments.\n\nOur goal is to develop advanced algorithms and methodologies capable of capturing dynamic surface and texture models from multi-view video in natural, uncontrolled settings. This will enable the reconstruction of dynamic surface models with unprecedented shape detail, even in outdoor scenes and under complex lighting situations. The techniques will be designed to handle scenes with multiple objects and complex material and reflectance distributions, and to reconstruct modifiable scene models for convenient post-capture adjustments.\n\nBy employing sparse and moving sets of cameras, including readily available mobile phones, we plan to make performance capture more accessible and versatile. The ability to operate in varied and uncontrolled lighting conditions will allow for capturing dense and crowded scenes with complex shape deformations, vastly expanding the technology's usability.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include transforming performance capture from a research-focused technology to a practical tool that can be used in a wide range of applications. We anticipate that our work will provide groundbreaking scientific insights into the way dynamic scenes and performances are captured and represented digitally. Ultimately, by addressing the current limitations, this project will unlock revolutionary new applications in fields such as film and video production, virtual reality, and digital archiving, among others.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Performance Capture of the Real World in Motion\" project aims to radically transform the field of performance capture by addressing and overcoming the significant limitations of current technologies. Presently, performance capture is restricted to indoor studios, necessitates controlled lighting conditions, relies on dense static camera arrays, and is generally limited to single objects with very limited shape detail. These technologies make simplistic assumptions about materials, reflectance, and lighting, and produce data that is difficult to modify.\n\nThis ambitious project has set several goals to revolutionize the industry. We aim to capture dynamic surface and texture models from multi-view video in general scenes, including outdoor environments, without the need for controlled lighting. The project will push the boundaries to handle complex material and reflectance distributions and work in uncontrolled, unknown lighting conditions. We plan to capture dense and crowded scenes with intricate shape deformations and reconstruct scene models that are conveniently modifiable. Importantly, our approach is designed to operate with sparse and moving sets of cameras, making it accessible to mobile phone technology.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are threefold. First, we will turn performance capture from a research-centric technology into a practical tool that can be widely used in various industries. Second, the scientific insights gained from this research will be groundbreaking, setting new standards for accuracy and realism in performance capture. Third, by overcoming the existing barriers, we will open up revolutionary new applications in fields such as virtual reality, augmented reality, film, gaming, telepresence, and beyond.\n\nIn summary, by pioneering a new generation of performance capture techniques, this project represents a significant leap forward, making highly detailed and realistic capture of the real world in motion not just a possibility, but a practical reality.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: \"Performance Capture of the Real World in Motion\"\n\nThe proposed project, \"Performance Capture of the Real World in Motion,\" seeks to revolutionize the field of performance capture by transcending the limitations of current technologies. Traditional methods are confined to indoor studios, necessitate controlled lighting, rely on dense static camera arrays, and are often restricted to capturing single objects with limited detail. Moreover, these methods are based on simplistic assumptions about materials, reflectance, and lighting, and they produce models that are not easily modifiable.\n\nOur project aims to pioneer a new generation of performance capture techniques that will facilitate the acquisition of dynamic surface and texture models with unprecedented shape detail from multi-view video. The objectives include the ability to succeed in general scenes outdoors and outside the lab, handle scenes with complex material and reflectance distributions, and operate in uncontrolled and unknown lighting conditions. Additionally, the project aims to capture dense and crowded scenes with complex shape deformations and reconstruct modifiable scene models, all while functioning with sparse and moving sets of cameras, including mobile devices such as smartphones.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this groundbreaking initiative are threefold: turning performance capture from a research technology into a practical, widely accessible tool; providing significant scientific insights into the complexities of real-world motion capture; and opening up revolutionary new applications across various fields such as film production, virtual reality, physical therapy, and beyond.\n\nBy leveraging sparse and mobile camera systems, the technology developed through this project promises to bring the power of high-fidelity, three-dimensional motion capture out of the studio and into the dynamic and unpredictable environments of the real world."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Dark-Soliton Engineering in Microresonator Frequency Combs,\" addresses the critical challenge posed by the increasing internet data traffic and the capacity limits of single-mode fiber-optic communications. As the demand for higher data rates continues to grow, space division multiplexing (SDM) has emerged as a promising technology to increase lightwave communication system capacity. This project seeks to further advance the field by integrating SDM with the cutting-edge microresonator frequency comb technology. These combs, generated within micrometer-scale cavities, are noted for their compact size and compatibility with semiconductor fabrication, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including frequency synthesis, metrology, and mass-market products.\n\nDespite their potential, microresonator frequency combs currently face an obstacle in poor power conversion efficiency. This proposal outlines a novel approach to overcome this limitation by engineering dark temporal solitons within linearly coupled microresonators. The goal is to achieve exceptionally high power conversion efficiency in microresonator combs, providing optimal characteristics for SDM applications and scaling advantages in fiber-optic communications. The expected outcomes of this project extend beyond the communications field, with implications for various high-precision industries.\n\nThe applicant brings to the project a unique background in fiber communications, photonic waveguides, and ultrafast photonics, coupled with broad international experience. Preliminary results and the availability of necessary infrastructure at the university underscore the feasibility of the proposed research. This project represents a transformative step in the development of future fiber-optic communication systems, with the potential to significantly enhance data transmission reliability and efficiency.",

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Death and Life of Catalysts: a Theory-Guided Unified Approach for Non-Critical Metal Catalyst Development\n\nThe proposed project, DeLiCat, seeks to revolutionize the field of catalysis by developing a new generation of non-critical metal-based catalysts through a theory-guided unified approach. Recognizing the limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods, our goal is to formulate a hierarchical computational strategy that integrates advanced chemical theory, computational screening, and experimental approaches from both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This strategy aims to design and synthesize durable, cost-effective, highly active, and selective catalysts for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids and their esters, as well as for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols.\n\nOur approach will employ computer simulations to uncover complex reaction networks, enabling us to direct selectivity and prevent catalyst deactivation paths. By designing novel multifunctional catalyst systems, we will facilitate efficient knowledge exchange loops that guide and validate theoretical predictions through rigorous experimental studies. The project aligns with crucial fields of application including biomass valorization, hydrogen technology, and both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.\n\nExpected outcomes from DeLiCat include the establishment of new theoretical concepts and methodological advances that will lead to the creation of novel superior catalyst systems. These catalysts are anticipated to enhance the efficiency of liquid phase chemical transformations, thus contributing to sustainable chemical practices.\n\nBy advancing first principles-guided catalyst design, DeLiCat represents a significant leap forward in the development of environmentally friendly and economically viable catalysts. This project holds the promise of mitigating the dependency on critical metals, thereby impacting the global challenge of resource scarcity and promoting sustainable industrial processes.\n\nWord Count: 270",

This initiative aims to address the need for sustainable and economically viable catalysts in chemical transformations crucial to hydrogen technology and biomass valorization.\n\nOur primary objectives are to: 1) formulate a hierarchical computational strategy for the design and synthesis of non-critical metal-based catalysts; 2) develop new, durable, and cost-effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids and their esters; and 3) create catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. These goals will be accomplished by integrating advanced chemical theory with computational screening, complemented by experimental approaches from both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis fields. The project will establish an efficient knowledge exchange loop to bridge theoretical models and experimental validation.\n\nDeLiCat's innovative approach will utilize computer simulations to uncover complex reaction networks, thereby enabling the direct control of selectivity and the prevention of catalyst deactivation paths. The design of novel multifunctional catalyst systems will be guided by first principles, aiming to establish new theoretical concepts and methodological advances that can be practically applied.\n\nThe expected outcomes of DeLiCat include the development of novel superior catalyst systems that are highly active, selective, and resilient, which are anticipated to contribute significantly to liquid phase chemical transformations.

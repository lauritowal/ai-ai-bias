        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Institutions and Metaphysics of Cosmology in the Epistemic Networks of Seventeenth-Century Europe\" represents an ambitious interdisciplinary investigation into the interplay between cosmological debates and confessional politics during a tumultuous period of scientific and religious transformation. Focusing on the seventeenth century, a time marked by significant events such as the Roman prohibition of the Copernican system in 1616 and the condemnation of Galileo in 1633, this research aims to unravel the complex relationships between competing confessional discourses on cosmology, religious conflicts, and the formation of opposing epistemic cultures.\n\nThrough a comparative analysis of the Protestant web of northern European universities and the global web of Jesuit colleges, this study explores the political-confessional dimension of early-modern cosmology, highlighting how science was deeply embedded in the struggles for cultural hegemony. The project addresses the controversial topics of heliocentrism, the plurality of worlds, the nature of space and infinity, cometary theory, and the constitution of celestial matter, all of which were hotly debated within these institutional networks.\n\nThe research objectives are threefold: to address interrelations between cosmological debates within northern European Protestant networks, to assess cosmological debates in Jesuit networks, and to perform a comparative assessment of their early formations and transformations of epistemic webs. This study seeks to bridge a gap in the literature by offering a comparative study that integrates the history of knowledge institutions with their metaphysical legitimation.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to provide new insights into the early-modern cosmological discourses that shaped the scientific communities and institutions of the time. By examining the parallelisms, contrasts, and intersections of these discourses, the project contributes to our understanding of the diverse epistemic cultures that emerged along confessional and political lines of alliance and opposition in seventeenth-century Europe.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Institutions and Metaphysics of Cosmology in the Epistemic Networks of Seventeenth-Century Europe\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking study examining the intersections of scientific discourse, confessional politics, and institutional influence on cosmological debates in seventeenth-century Europe. The project, \"Institutions and Metaphysics of Cosmology in the Epistemic Networks of Seventeenth-Century Europe,\" aims to uncover the complex dynamics between competing confessional discourses on cosmology and the opposing epistemic cultures that emerged during a time of intense religious conflict.\n\nAt the heart of the study are two predominant institutional networks: the Protestant web of northern European universities and the global web of Jesuit colleges. The research will scrutinize cosmological controversies such as heliocentrism, the plurality of worlds, and the nature of celestial matter, contextualized against significant historical events like the Roman prohibition of the Copernican system in 1616 and the condemnation of Galileo in 1633.\n\nThe project's objectives include a comparative assessment of the early formations and transformations of epistemic webs within these networks. By analyzing parallelisms and contrasts, as well as negotiations and intersections of cosmological discourses, the research will offer a nuanced understanding of how cosmological ideas were shaped by the political-confessional dimension of early-modern cosmology.\n\nThis study fills a critical gap in the literature by providing a comparative analysis of the history of knowledge institutions and their metaphysical legitimation. It will elucidate how science was embedded in struggles for cultural hegemony and shaped by institutional and ideological battles. The findings will significantly contribute to our comprehension of the intricate relationship between knowledge, power, and belief systems in the development of early modern cosmology.\n\nKeywords: seventeenth-century cosmology, epistemic networks, confessional discourses, institutional influence, religious conflicts, comparative study.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Institutions and Metaphysics of Cosmology in the Epistemic Networks of Seventeenth-Century Europe\" embarks on a comparative historical analysis of how cosmological debates were entwined with religious conflicts and political alliances during a period of significant scientific and intellectual upheaval. The seventeenth century witnessed profound changes in the understanding of the universe, with controversies over heliocentrism, the plurality of worlds, and the nature of celestial matter challenging traditional cosmological views. This project aims to dissect the complex interplay between these cosmological debates and the confessional discourses that prevailed in the Protestant web of northern European universities and the global network of Jesuit colleges.\n\nKey historical events such as the Roman prohibition of the Copernican system in 1616 and the condemnation of Galileo in 1633 provide critical milestones for studying the transformation of epistemic webs and the formation of cosmological cultures along confessional and political lines. The project's objectives include addressing interrelations between these debates within Protestant and Jesuit institutional networks, offering a comparative assessment of their early formations, and exploring the political-confessional dimension of early-modern cosmology.\n\nThe importance of this research lies in its exploration of science as it is embedded in the struggles for cultural hegemony, highlighting the institutional and ideological battles that shaped scientific thought. By filling a gap in the comparative study of the history of knowledge institutions and their metaphysical legitimation, this project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the ways in which differing epistemic cultures negotiated, intersected, and diverged in the pursuit of cosmological truth during a transformative era in European history.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, \"Institutions and Metaphysics of Cosmology in the Epistemic Networks of Seventeenth-Century Europe,\" undertakes a groundbreaking comparative analysis of the religious and political underpinnings of cosmological debates during a period defined by significant scientific and confessional upheaval. The seventeenth century witnessed the emergence of opposing epistemic cultures, particularly within the Protestant network of northern European universities and the global web of Jesuit colleges. These institutions were pivotal in shaping discussions on heliocentrism, the plurality of worlds, and the nature of celestial matter—controversies that were further intensified by events such as the Roman prohibition of the Copernican system in 1616 and Galileo's condemnation in 1633.\n\nThe project will focus on the intersection of scientific discourse and confessional politics, examining how cosmological debates were influenced by the increasing political and confessional fragmentation of the time. By exploring the formation of competing cosmological cultures along confessional and political lines, the research aims to unravel the complex interrelations between cosmological debates in northern European Protestant and Jesuit networks. It will provide a comparative assessment of early formations and transformations of epistemic webs, seeking to identify parallelisms, contrasts, and intersections in seventeenth-century cosmological discourses.\n\nSignificance lies in addressing the gap in literature concerning the comparative study of the history of knowledge institutions and their metaphysical legitimation. This research will illuminate the political-confessional dimension of early-modern cosmology and the extent to which science was embedded in the struggles for cultural hegemony. The findings are expected to make a vital contribution to our understanding of how institutional and ideological battles shaped the development of early modern science, offering a nuanced perspective on the nature of these epistemic cultures and their lasting impact."

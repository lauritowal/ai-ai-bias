        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"New Sensor Devices Based on Soft Chemistry Assisted Nanostructured Functional Oxides on Si Integrated Systems\" (SENSiSOFT) project seeks to revolutionize the field of piezoelectric sensors by producing cutting-edge devices with nanometer-scale precision. Aiming to meet the billion-euro industry's demand for ultra-sensitive wireless mechanical sensors, SENSiSOFT proposes a synthesis of advanced materials science and innovative engineering approaches. The core materials—quartz, perovskite, and hollandites—are abundant, economical, and environmentally benign, providing a sustainable foundation for the development of the proposed sensor technologies.\n\nAddressing the challenge of bridging soft-chemistry processes with microfabrication techniques, SENSiSOFT outlines three strategic approaches: (i) integration of high-response piezoelectric epitaxial quartz, hollandite, and perovskite oxide thin layers onto silicon substrates through a unified, monolithic soft chemistry process; (ii) nanostructuration of these epitaxial oxide thin films into precisely controlled morphologies, including porous structures as well as one-dimensional nanowires or nanorods; and (iii) the fabrication of advanced nanostructured sensors, such as SAW resonator-based and LAMB-WAVE multisensors, using MEMs technologies for silicon micromachining.\n\nThese strategies aim to develop sensor devices that surpass current detection thresholds by 10 to 100 times in both 1D and 2D configurations of novel piezoelectric oxides. The project envisions the creation of highly sensitive wireless network sensor (WNS) nodes, SAW resonator-based sensors, and LAMB-WAVE multisensors capable of monitoring mechanical parameters with unprecedented precision.\n\nSENSiSOFT holds the promise of delivering transformative sensor devices that are not only highly sensitive but also tailored for integration into a variety of applications, positioning the project at the forefront of the sensor technology industry.",

The project, which addresses a market with billion euro potential, proposes a groundbreaking approach to integrate high-response piezoelectric materials such as quartz, perovskite, and hollandites onto silicon substrates. The core challenge lies in bridging the gap between soft chemistry synthesis and conventional microfabrication techniques.\n\nSENSiSOFT's innovative strategies include: (i) the chemical integration of epitaxial quartz, hollandite, and perovskite oxide thin films onto silicon substrates using a unified, monolithic process; (ii) the controlled nanostructuration of these films into morphologies such as porous structures and 1D nanowires or nanorods; and (iii) the fabrication of advanced sensor devices, including a nanostructured Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) resonator-based sensor and a LAMB-WAVE multisensor. These sensors will employ MEMs technology for silicon micromachining and will be capable of monitoring mechanical parameters in both 1D and 2D configurations.\n\nThe expected outcome of SENSiSOFT is a new class of sensor devices that are not only significantly more sensitive but also built using abundant, cost-effective, and harmless materials. The project will deliver wireless network sensor (WNS) nodes that can seamlessly integrate into existing systems, providing enhanced capability for a wide range of applications, from industrial process control to environmental monitoring.

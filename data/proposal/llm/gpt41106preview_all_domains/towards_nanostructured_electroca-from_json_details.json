        "Abstract\n\nProposal Name: Towards Nanostructured Electrocatalysts with Superior Stability\n\nProject Name: 123STABLE\n\nThe proposed research project, \"123STABLE,\" aims to address the critical challenge of electrocatalyst degradation in the context of the burgeoning Hydrogen economy, which demands materials with both high activity and exceptional stability. Despite decades of progress, the insufficient electrochemical stability of noble metal-based nanoparticles, such as those composed of platinum and iridium, remains a significant obstacle. These materials suffer from scarce supply and uneven geological distribution, intensifying the need for sustainable and stable alternatives.\n\n\"123STABLE\" focuses on the fundamental understanding of structure-activity and structure-stability relationships at solid-liquid interfaces, specifically targeting the lack of stability fundamentals. The project employs a suite of sophisticated techniques, including identical location electron microscopy, online monitoring through electrochemical flow cells, and online mass spectrometers, to observe and model the behavior of nanoparticles under electrochemical conditions. Sensitivity to picogram scale and sub-atomic resolution will enable unprecedented insights into processes like corrosion and reconstruction, before and after electrochemical treatment.\n\nThe research will explore atomic features such as weak and stable sites, and nanoparticle features including size and shape. Interventions such as doping, decoration, and synthetic modification will be tested as stabilization strategies, with an emphasis on the blockage of defected sites vulnerable to degradation, like steps and kinks. The project's ultimate goal is to develop nanostructured electrocatalysts that exhibit superior stability for long-term application in energy conversion and storage systems, thus advancing the electrification of society through the sustainable Hydrogen economy.\n\nThe importance of this research is underscored by the pressing need to increase the stability of electrocatalysts to ensure their practical viability and economic feasibility, especially given the resource scarcity and supply challenges associated with noble metals. \"123STABLE\" promises to deliver transformative insights and solutions, propelling the field towards commercially viable and environmentally responsible electrocatalysis.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Towards Nanostructured Electrocatalysts with Superior Stability\" project, codenamed 123STABLE, aims to spearhead the development of advanced electrocatalysts crucial for the electrification of society through the burgeoning Hydrogen economy. Despite notable progress over recent decades in understanding structure-activity relationships, the lack of sufficient electrochemical stability in noble metal-based nanoparticles such as platinum and iridium remains a critical barrier. This project addresses the fundamental gaps in our knowledge regarding the stability of solid-liquid interfaces and the principles governing electrocatalytic activity.\n\nLeveraging cutting-edge techniques such as state-of-the-art electron microscopy, online mass spectrometers, and electrochemical flow cells, 123STABLE will conduct in-depth studies at the picogram and sub-atomic scale. By employing identical location and online monitoring methods, the project will provide unparalleled insights into the corrosion and reconstruction processes of nanoparticles, observing the same nanoparticles before and after electrochemical treatment. This approach will elucidate the relationship between nanoparticle features such as size and shape, and their stability, focusing on vulnerable sites like steps and kinks.\n\n123STABLE's stabilization strategies will explore doping, decoration, and synthetic modification, specifically targeting the blockage of defected sites. The project will develop model systems using platinum-based and iridium-based nanostructures, acknowledging the importance of these materials' scarcity and uneven geological distribution.\n\nBy understanding and manipulating atomic features to enhance the stability of electrocatalysts, the project promises to deliver groundbreaking solutions to the stability issues that hinder the scalability of clean energy technologies. Ultimately, 123STABLE aims to produce nanostructured electrocatalysts with superior stability, fostering the transition to an environmentally sustainable energy future.",

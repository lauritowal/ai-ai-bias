        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Disruption of systemic and microenvironmental barriers to immunotherapy of antigenic tumors\n\nDespite the potential of immunotherapy to treat cancers bearing immunogenic neo-antigens, Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers often exhibit a disappointing response. Our project seeks to address the question of why these cancers evade the immune system's cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are pivotal for tumor eradication. We hypothesize that HPV-induced cancers establish barriers both systemically and within the tumor microenvironment that prevent CTL induction, infiltration, and killing. These barriers include systemic antigen-nonspecific immunosuppression and the expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, which impair the function of CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting dendritic cells.\n\nOur research aims to rigorously explore these resistance mechanisms through genetic and pharmacological approaches using mouse models of HPV-induced cancer. We will investigate how oncogene-expressing keratinocytes contribute to the expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and assess the therapeutic potential of combining barrier-breaking strategies with immune-stimulatory modalities.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this work are twofold: a comprehensive understanding of the barriers to effective immunotherapy in HPV-induced cancers and the establishment of a foundation for developing efficacious immunotherapeutic strategies for these and other refractory cancers. By elucidating and targeting the complex interplay between cancer cells and the immune system, our project promises to propel the field of cancer immunotherapy research forward and offer hope to patients with HPV-induced cancers that currently lack effective treatment options.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Disruption of Systemic and Microenvironmental Barriers to Immunotherapy of Antigenic Tumors\n\nThis grant proposal focuses on the critical challenge of enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy for HPV-induced cancers, which, despite encoding immunogenic neo-antigens, often demonstrate resistance to current immunotherapeutic approaches. The central hypothesis posits that HPV-induced cancers erect multiple systemic and tumor microenvironmental barriers that prevent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induction, infiltration, and effective killing of cancer cells.\n\nOur objectives are to: (1) establish the functional importance of these barriers to CTL activity; (2) investigate the role of oncogene-expressing keratinocytes in the expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells; (3) elucidate how these myeloid cells inhibit CD8 T cells and dendritic cells; and (4) assess the therapeutic potential of combination strategies that break these barriers while stimulating the immune system.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we will utilize mouse models of HPV-induced cancer to genetically and pharmacologically probe the identified barriers. This will include an in-depth analysis of the systemic antigen-nonspecific immunosuppression and immune response-impairing barriers within the tumor microenvironment, particularly focusing on the influence of expanded populations of myeloid cells.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include gaining new insights into the resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy and laying the groundwork for the development of efficacious therapeutic strategies for cancers that are currently refractory to immunotherapies. Ultimately, this work aims to transform the treatment landscape for HPV-induced cancers by overcoming the complex interplay of barriers that limit the success of immunotherapeutic interventions.\n\nKeywords: HPV-induced cancers, immunotherapy, systemic barriers, tumor microenvironment, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, myeloid cells, immunosuppression.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Disruption of systemic and microenvironmental barriers to immunotherapy of antigenic tumors\n\nDespite the promise of immunotherapy in treating various cancers, HPV-induced cancers remain stubbornly resistant due to complex barriers that prevent the effective induction, infiltration, and killing of cancer cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The proposed project, named \"Disruption of systemic and microenvironmental barriers to immunotherapy of antigenic tumors,\" aims to dissect and overcome these barriers. Our research will focus on exploring resistance mechanisms to tumor-reactive CTLs in HPV-induced cancers, which are known to encode immunogenic neo-antigens, yet show limited responsiveness to current immunotherapies.\n\nOur objectives are to establish the functional importance of these barriers, investigate the role of oncogene-expressing keratinocytes in expanding immunosuppressive myeloid cell populations, probe the inhibition of CD8 T cells and dendritic cells by myeloid cells, and finally, assess the therapeutic potential of combining barrier-breaking strategies with immunostimulatory modalities. To achieve these goals, we plan to employ a variety of mouse models to genetically and pharmacologically probe these barriers.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include gaining new knowledge about the systemic and microenvironmental factors that impede immunotherapy in HPV-induced cancers and laying the groundwork for the development of more efficacious immunotherapeutic strategies. Ultimately, this project aims to translate insights from the bench to the bedside, offering hope for patients with cancers that currently have limited treatment options.\n\nKeywords: HPV-induced cancers, immunotherapy, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, myeloid cells, tumor microenvironment, cancer resistance mechanisms.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Disruption of systemic and microenvironmental barriers to immunotherapy of antigenic tumors,\" seeks to address the critical challenge of immunotherapy resistance in HPV-induced cancers, which encode immunogenic neo-antigens yet remain unresponsive to current immunotherapeutic approaches. The primary goal is to investigate and dismantle the multifaceted barriers which impede cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) induction, infiltration, and subsequent killing of cancer cells.\n\nDespite encoding immunogenic neo-antigens, HPV-induced cancers demonstrate a lack of efficacy to immunotherapy, primarily due to pre-existing and adaptive resistance mechanisms. Our hypothesis suggests that multiple systemic and microenvironmental barriers established by HPV-induced cancers thwart CTL responses. These include systemic antigen-nonspecific immunosuppression and the expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells within the spleen, lymph nodes, and the tumor microenvironment itself.\n\nTo probe these barriers, our research will employ genetic and pharmacological strategies, utilizing mouse models of HPV-induced cancer. We aim to understand the role of oncogene-expressing keratinocytes in the expansion of myeloid cells and their subsequent impact on CD8 T cells and dendritic cells. Additionally, we will assess the therapeutic potential of combining barrier-breaking strategies with immuno-stimulatory modalities.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include the generation of novel insights into the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy in HPV-induced cancers and establishing the groundwork for the development of more efficacious immunotherapeutic strategies against these refractory cancers. Our multi-pronged approach promises to advance the field of cancer immunotherapy research significantly, providing hope for improved treatments for patients with challenging HPV-related malignancies."

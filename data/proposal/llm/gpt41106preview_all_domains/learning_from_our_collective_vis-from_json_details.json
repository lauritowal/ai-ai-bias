        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: LEarning from our collective visual memory to Analyze its trends and Predict future events (LEAP)\n\nThe LEAP project seeks to harness the power of our collective visual memory by analyzing and predicting dynamic patterns using extensive visual data sets. This ambitious endeavor aims to create a framework that will leverage visual information from public archives, the Internet, and various camera feeds to inform and forecast future events.\n\nKey objectives of LEAP include analyzing dynamic patterns in shared visual experiences, identifying and quantifying trends within these patterns, and developing a predictive model for future events in dynamic scenes. To achieve these goals, the project faces several challenges: the invention of new models capable of processing large-scale spatio-temporal data, the generalization of these models to operate across diverse data sources and imaging conditions, the measurement of long-term changes in related scenes, and the synthesis of complex predictions from historical visual experiences.\n\nThe methodology of LEAP will involve designing novel models that can handle different imaging conditions, developing a comprehensive framework for trend identification and quantification, and creating a robust methodology for generating sophisticated future projections based on past visual experiences. These innovative approaches will allow for significant advancements in various applications, including the development of safer cars with enhanced abilities to anticipate pedestrian behavior, medical tools that assist in patient health monitoring, diagnosis, and prediction, and smart glasses designed to aid users in reacting appropriately to unfamiliar situations.\n\nThe potential impact of LEAP is vast, promising to revolutionize the way we understand and interact with our environment. By learning from the past, we aim to predict and prepare for the future, ensuring enhanced safety, health, and adaptability in a rapidly changing world.",

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: LEarning from our collective visual memory to Analyze its trends and Predict future events (LEAP)\n\nThe LEAP project seeks to harness the vast amount of visual data continuously generated and stored in public archives, on the Internet, and through various cameras to construct a collective visual memory. This memory will serve as a foundation for analyzing dynamic patterns, quantifying trends, and predicting future events in dynamic scenes. Our objectives are to develop novel models capable of handling the large-scale, spatio-temporal, and distributed nature of visual data and to generalize these models across different data sources and imaging conditions. The challenge lies in synthesizing complex future predictions based on past visual experiences and measuring long-term changes in related scenes.\n\nThe proposed methodology includes designing new models that can adapt to varying conditions, developing a comprehensive framework for trend analysis, and creating tools for complex prediction synthesis. These efforts will culminate in significant potential impacts across various sectors. In automotive safety, the predictive models will enable cars to anticipate pedestrian behavior, reducing the risk of accidents. In healthcare, the tools developed will assist medical professionals in monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting patient outcomes more effectively. Additionally, smart glasses equipped with our predictive technology will help individuals navigate and react appropriately in unfamiliar situations.\n\nLEAP represents a groundbreaking approach to understanding and leveraging our collective visual memory for practical and wide-ranging applications.

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Topological Crystalline Insulator Nanowires\" project is a visionary initiative that aims to tackle the pervasive issue of quantum decoherence which poses a substantial barrier to the development of reliable quantum computers. This cutting-edge research proposes the development of a novel nanomaterials system based on topological crystalline insulator nanowires, which leverages the unique properties of Majorana modes for information encoding. The project's goal is to exploit the local symmetry inherent in these materials for topological protection, promising long coherence times essential for quantum computing.\n\nEmploying advanced crystal growth strategies such as out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium structures, the project will utilize Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) for the growth of SnTe nanowires, followed by the innovative technique of shadow-growing superconductors on one facet of the nanowire. This will result in in-situ ultra-high-vacuum growth of hybrid semiconductor/superconductor devices with unprecedented device quality.\n\nThe expected outcomes are multifold: the establishment of robust topological states, an increase in system energy scales, and the formation of stable, electrically-isolated Majorana states. The project's crowning achievements will be the demonstration of entanglement between two Majorana modes and conducting a groundbreaking quantum teleportation experiment.\n\nThis ambitious project not only aims to create a new state of matter but also to pioneer structures that operate out of thermodynamic equilibrium, enabling a leap forward in quantum computation. The successful integration of strong superconductors on these nanowires symbolizes a significant stride towards the realization of topological quantum computers, potentially revolutionizing computing technology and quantum science.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Optimized drug combinations for effective cancer treatment: a personalised approach,\" aims to develop improved treatment strategies for patients with metastasized colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) following first-line chemotherapy failure. Despite advancements in cancer therapy, there is a pressing need for personalized treatment options for mCRC that can deliver effective results without adverse side effects.\n\nOur approach leverages a differential evolution guided stochastic search algorithm in conjunction with feedback system control (FSC) techniques. These methods have previously been applied to identify optimal synergistic low-dose drug combinations among nine angiostatic drugs at four different doses through in vitro cell viability testing. The outcome showed promising anti-cancer activity with maintained dose ratios, translating into effective treatment in vivo without side effects.\n\nThe proposed research will screen for the optimal targeted combination treatment for advanced CRC using seven genetically diverse human CRC cell lines. These will then be translated ratiometrically into orthotopic and metastasizing preclinical CRC mouse models, compared parallel to standard chemotherapy regimens. Furthermore, the project will innovate by developing a personalized screening method using freshly isolated tumor cells, preparing for clinical application.\n\nOur innovative strategy also includes the validation of previously identified novel markers of the tumor endothelium, leading to the design of new drugs for optimal combination therapy for mCRC. The translational and multidisciplinary nature of the proposal underscores its potential for significantly impacting the clinical management of mCRC, moving towards personalized, effective, and safe cancer treatment regimens.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to prepare an improved therapeutic combination regimen for clinical testing in cancer patients, potentially revolutionizing the approach to mCRC treatment and enhancing the quality of life for those affected by this challenging disease.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Optimized Drug Combinations for Effective Cancer Treatment: A Personalised Approach\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a cutting-edge research project aimed at improving the treatment of metastasized colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) following first-line chemotherapy. The core of our approach utilizes a differential evolution guided stochastic search algorithm, building on previous research that employed the feedback system control (FSC) technique. Our preliminary studies have successfully identified optimal synergistic low-dose drug combinations through in vitro cell viability testing and algorithm-based analysis, using nine angiostatic drugs at four different doses. These combinations have shown effective anti-cancer activity without side-effects when translated into in vivo mouse models.\n\nThe proposed research will extend these findings by screening for optimal targeted combination treatments for advanced CRC. This will involve simulating personalized treatment with seven genetically different human CRC cell lines and translating these findings ratiometrically into orthotopic and metastasizing preclinical CRC mouse models. The comparison with standard chemotherapy regimens will be instrumental in demonstrating the efficacy and specificity of our approach.\n\nA key innovation of this proposal is the development of a personalized screening method using freshly isolated tumor cells from mCRC patients. This method is expected to unveil novel markers of the tumor endothelium, which will be validated and potentially lead to the design of new drugs. Our multidisciplinary team will be preparing for the clinical application of these improved therapeutic combination regimens, with the ultimate goal of enhancing patient outcomes in the treatment of mCRC.\n\nThe translational and multidisciplinary nature of this proposal embodies the convergence of algorithm-based precision medicine, preclinical drug testing, and clinical application preparation. By integrating innovative research strategies with a personalized treatment approach, we aim to revolutionize the management of mCRC, paving the way for more effective and tailored therapies for cancer patients.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Optimized drug combinations for effective cancer treatment: a personalised approach,\" aims to revolutionize the treatment of metastasized colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) by identifying optimal therapeutic drug combinations. Following first-line chemotherapy, patients with mCRC face limited treatment options. Leveraging a differential evolution guided stochastic search algorithm and feedback system control (FSC) technique, this project builds upon previous research that has successfully identified synergistic, low-dose drug combinations in vitro, demonstrating effective anti-cancer activity without adverse side effects when translated to in vivo mouse models.\n\nThe proposed research entails a personalized screening process using seven genetically distinct human CRC cell lines to simulate individual patient responses. Orthotopic and metastasizing preclinical mouse models will be employed to validate the efficacy of these drug combinations, maintaining the ratio of drug doses to mirror the in vitro synergy. This research will be compared against standard chemotherapy regimens to ascertain the improvement in efficacy.\n\nA significant innovation of this project lies in the development of a personalized screening method utilizing freshly isolated tumor cells from patients. This approach ensures that the preclinical models closely replicate the human disease, enhancing the translational potential of the research findings. Furthermore, the project aims to validate previously identified novel markers of the tumor endothelium, which could lead to the design of new drugs that enhance the effectiveness of combination therapies for mCRC.\n\nThe proposal is characterized by its translational and multidisciplinary nature, involving collaboration across various fields of expertise, with the ultimate goal of preparing an improved therapeutic combination regimen for clinical testing in cancer patients. By personalizing treatment strategies, this research has the potential to significantly extend survival and improve the quality of life for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces a cutting-edge project titled \"Optimized drug combinations for effective cancer treatment: a personalised approach,\" targeting metastasized colorectal carcinoma (mCRC). Despite advancements in cancer therapy, there is a pressing need for novel treatment strategies following first-line chemotherapy's limited success. Our research focuses on the pivotal phase of identifying and preparing improved therapeutic combination regimens for subsequent testing in cancer patients.\n\nIn previous research, we employed a differential evolution guided stochastic search algorithm paired with a feedback system control (FSC) technique. This innovative methodological duo was tested on nine angiostatic drugs at four different doses, resulting in the discovery of optimal synergistic low-dose drug combinations. These combinations, when translated in vivo, have demonstrated effective anti-cancer activity without inducing side-effects, maintaining the drug dose ratio in preclinical models.\n\nThe proposed research will expand upon this groundwork by screening seven genetically distinct human mCRC cell lines, aiming to simulate personalized treatment. The preclinical models, including orthotopic and metastasizing mouse models, will be compared with standard chemotherapy regimens. The development of a personalized screening method using freshly isolated tumor cells will prepare for clinical application, while the identification and validation of novel tumor endothelium markers will inform the design of new drugs.\n\nOur approach is both translational and multidisciplinary, with the ultimate goal of preparing an improved therapeutic combination regimen for testing in cancer patients with advanced CRC. The innovative strategy, grounded in prior success, promises to not only refine treatment personalization but also to enhance the efficacy and safety of cancer therapies. The project embodies a leap towards precision medicine and opens a pathway for developing targeted therapeutics tailored to individual patient profiles, potentially revolutionizing the management of mCRC and other cancers."

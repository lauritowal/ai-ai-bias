        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Mapping Dispersion Spectroscopically in Large Gas-Phase Molecular Ions,\" aims to advance the understanding of non-covalent 'dispersion' interactions within large gas-phase molecular ions using cutting-edge infrared (IR) spectroscopy. This research will employ a custom cryogenic Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) spectrometer to examine the conformational equilibria and N-H frequency shifts in molecules such as 'onium' cations and proton-bound dimers. The project will establish a novel experimental benchmark for the quantitative evaluation of dispersion forces in large molecules, which have traditionally lacked robust experimental data.\n\nA critical aspect of the study is the correlation between gas-phase IR frequency and the N-H-N bond angle in an ionic H-bond, which will provide a sensitive test of computational methods and offer insights into the steric effects impacting organic chemistry. The experimental design includes the use of tunable IR sources, the chemical synthesis of custom substrates, and quantum calculations up to coupled-cluster levels of theory to ensure accurate and comprehensive data collection.\n\nThe interdisciplinary approach, combining physical and organic chemistry, will enable the team to address challenges such as the quantitative evaluation of dispersion forces and the absence of experimental benchmarks for large molecules in the gas phase. The research is anticipated to have a significant impact on the understanding of steric effects in organic chemistry, providing a foundational understanding that can lead to the development of new synthetic pathways and materials.\n\nBy eliminating the solvation effect, which cancels out the attractive potential in condensed phases, the project will isolate and directly measure the intrinsic dispersion interactions under controlled gas-phase conditions. This work will set a new standard for the study of non-covalent interactions, offering a powerful tool for the chemical sciences community to probe and understand the forces that govern molecular behavior.",
        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Mapping Dispersion Spectroscopically in Large Gas-Phase Molecular Ions\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to advance the understanding of non-covalent \"dispersion\" interactions in large molecular ions through the experimental and theoretical exploration of gas-phase infrared (IR) spectra. By utilizing a cryogenic Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) spectrometer, we aim to quantitatively evaluate the subtle dispersion forces in 'onium' cations and proton-bound dimers. These large, gas-phase molecular ions are challenging to study due to a lack of experimental benchmarks and the complexity of their quantitative evaluation.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach integrates physical and organic chemistry to synthesize custom substrates and employ tunable IR sources, with a focus on measuring conformational equilibria and N-H frequency shifts. Correlations between gas-phase IR frequency and the N-H-N bond angle in ionic hydrogen bonds will be established, providing insight into the conformational behavior and interaction potentials of substituents. The experimental design includes the use of a custom-built spectrometer and quantum calculations up to coupled-cluster levels of theory to ensure accurate and precise data.\n\nThis research addresses the critical challenge of understanding steric effects in organic chemistry by providing a sensitive test of computational methods. The project's success will result in a novel experimental benchmark for large molecules in the gas phase, offering a deeper understanding of the role of dispersion forces in molecular structure and reactivity. By eliminating solvation effects, we can isolate and directly measure the intrinsic properties of molecular interactions, which is pivotal for the accurate prediction and manipulation of chemical systems.\n\nThe outcomes of this project hold significant promise for broadening our comprehension of fundamental chemical phenomena and enhancing the precision of theoretical models used in the development of new materials and pharmaceuticals.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, \"Mapping Dispersion Spectroscopically in Large Gas-Phase Molecular Ions,\" seeks to advance the understanding of non-covalent, 'dispersion' interactions in large gas-phase molecular ions through the innovative use of infrared (IR) spectroscopy coupled with a cryogenic Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) spectrometer. Fundamental to the project is the study of conformational equilibria and N-H frequency shifts in molecular structures such as onium cations and proton-bound dimers, which are critical to organic chemistry and material science.\n\nThe project aims to quantitatively evaluate dispersion forces and establish experimental benchmarks for such large molecules in the gas phase, which have traditionally posed significant challenges due to the absence of solvation effects that can mask the subtle dispersion interactions. By correlating gas-phase IR frequency with N-H-N bond angle variations, the research hopes to elucidate the relationship between these frequencies and the strength of non-covalent interactions, particularly how dispersion forces influence the bending of the N-H-N bond in ionic hydrogen bonds.\n\nThe experimental design involves a custom-built cryogenic FT-ICR spectrometer with tunable IR sources, alongside chemical synthesis of custom substrates and quantum calculations up to coupled-cluster levels of theory to ensure precise measurements. This interdisciplinary approach combines physical and organic chemistry to provide a sensitive test of computational methods and other experimental benchmarks.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a deeper understanding of steric effects in organic chemistry, with implications for the synthesis and design of new molecular materials. By successfully mapping dispersion forces spectroscopically in isolated large molecular ions, the findings could significantly influence the interpretation of non-covalent interactions across a variety of chemical systems.\n\nKeywords: dispersion interactions, IR spectroscopy, gas-phase molecular ions, cryogenic FT-ICR spectrometer, non-covalent forces, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, experimental benchmarking.",

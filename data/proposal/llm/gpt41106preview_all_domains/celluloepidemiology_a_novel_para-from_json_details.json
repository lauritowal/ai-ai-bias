        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Celluloepidemiology: a novel paradigm for modeling T-cell responses on a population level\n\nThe CELLULO-EPI project, led by an interdisciplinary team comprising a paediatrician with a specialization in immunology and a physicist skilled in mathematical modeling, aims to introduce a groundbreaking concept termed 'Celluloepidemiology'. This innovative approach seeks to combine cellular immune responses with mathematical modeling to generate multidimensional T-cell profiles for a synthetic population. The project's central objective is to simulate the evolution of T-cell responses against infectious pathogens and to account for variables such as age, gender, and time since infection, among others.\n\nTo achieve this, CELLULO-EPI will develop a new model that captures the dynamics of T-cell evolution, which will be parameterized and fitted using cross-sectional T-cell data from 500 individuals, including those with known first-time infections such as dengue and measles. Additionally, longitudinal data from individuals re-exposed to pathogens like chickenpox and parvovirus B19 will be incorporated. The initial cohort will also be re-sampled after one year to refine the model's accuracy.\n\nThe public health implications of CELLULO-EPI are profound. By providing a more nuanced understanding of T-cell responses on a population level, the project promises to solve the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination dilemma and redefine infectious disease epidemiology. Moreover, it will enable the back-calculation of time since the last exposure to a pathogen—information critical for public health interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, CELLULO-EPI represents a transformative step in epidemiological modeling, with the potential to revolutionize both our theoretical understanding and practical management of infectious diseases.\n\nKeywords: Celluloepidemiology, T-cell responses, mathematical modeling, infectious diseases, public health.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Celluloepidemiology: a novel paradigm for modeling T-cell responses on a population level,\" spearheaded by a collaborative effort between a paediatrician specializing in immunology and a physicist seasoned in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, aims to introduce a groundbreaking concept: Celluloepidemiology. This innovative approach combines cellular immune responses with sophisticated mathematical modeling to generate multidimensional T-cell profiles that reflect the complexity of human immune responses to pathogens.\n\nThe core objective of CELLULO-EPI is to develop an advanced model capable of simulating the evolution of T-cells in response to infectious diseases across a synthetic population. By incorporating key variables such as age, gender, and time since infection, alongside other pertinent factors, the model promises to provide a comprehensive understanding of T-cell dynamics at the population level.\n\nThe project will utilize a rich array of data sources including cross-sectional T-cell data from 500 individuals, records of known first infections like dengue and measles, and longitudinal data from individuals with re-exposure to chickenpox and parvovirus B19. A one-year follow-up on the initial cohort will enhance the robustness of the model.\n\nCELLULO-EPI's public health implications are profound. It is poised to resolve the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination dilemma, redefine infectious disease epidemiology, and enable the back-calculation of time since last exposure to a pathogen. This pioneering model has the potential to offer pivotal insights for public health, shaping future strategies in disease prevention and control. Through this project, the team is set to revolutionize our understanding of T-cell mediated immunity on a population scale, offering a new lens through which to view and tackle infectious diseases.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe CELLULO-EPI project, spearheaded by a collaborative team comprising a paediatric immunologist and a physicist, introduces \"Celluloepidemiology,\" a pioneering concept that merges cellular immunity with mathematical modeling to revolutionize the study of infectious diseases on a population level. The overarching goal of this project is to generate a comprehensive, multidimensional T-cell profile for individuals within a synthetic population. This initiative will enable us to simulate the evolution of T-cell responses to infectious pathogens, taking into account variables such as age, gender, and time since infection, among others.\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a methodology for a novel computational model that will be developed to simulate and predict T-cell behavior in response to specific pathogens. The model will be parameterized using cross-sectional T-cell data from a cohort of 500 individuals, enriched with information from cases with known first infections of dengue and measles, as well as longitudinal data from re-exposure to chickenpox and parvovirus B19. These individuals will be followed up after one year to validate and refine the model.\n\nThe public health implications of the CELLULO-EPI model are profound: it has the potential to resolve the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination dilemma, redefine the approach to infectious disease epidemiology, and enable the back-calculation of time since last exposure to a pathogen. Ultimately, this project aims to provide critical insights into T-cell-mediated immunity, offering unprecedented tools for public health decision-making and the enhancement of disease prevention strategies. The successful development of the CELLULO-EPI model promises to set a new standard in epidemiological modeling and contribute significantly to global health security.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe CELLULO-EPI project, spearheaded by a collaboration between a paediatric immunologist and a physicist with expertise in mathematical disease modeling, proposes to introduce 'Celluloepidemiology'—a groundbreaking concept that integrates cellular immune responses with population-level mathematical modeling. The project aims to revolutionize the understanding of T-cell dynamics by generating comprehensive T-cell profiles that reflect individuals' immunological history and response to pathogens.\n\nTo achieve this, CELLULO-EPI will create an innovative model simulating T-cell evolution in response to infectious diseases within a synthetic population. Key variables incorporated into the model include age, gender, time since infection, and other pertinent factors. The model will be parametrized and validated using a robust dataset, which includes cross-sectional T-cell data from 500 participants, alongside cases with known first infections of dengue and measles, and longitudinal data of re-exposure to chickenpox and parvovirus B19. A follow-up will re-sample the initial cohort after a year to refine the model's predictive capacity.\n\nThis proposal's public health implications are profound. CELLULO-EPI has the potential to address the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination dilemma by allowing us to back-calculate the time since last exposure to a pathogen, thereby reshaping current approaches to infectious disease epidemiology. The anticipated outcomes include improved vaccination strategies, enhanced disease surveillance, and a deeper understanding of population immunity. By merging immunological insights with epidemiological patterns, CELLULO-EPI will provide critical information that could substantially inform public health decisions and strategies, making it a highly innovative and valuable contribution to the field of infectious disease research."

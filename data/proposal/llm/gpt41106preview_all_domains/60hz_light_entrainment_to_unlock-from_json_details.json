        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: 60-Hz Light Entrainment to Unlock Mental Health Conditions\n\nThe escalating burden of mental health conditions such as anxiety disorders and PTSD on society necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies beyond the moderate-to-weak efficacy of current psychiatric medications. This proposal seeks funding to advance a groundbreaking, non-invasive therapeutic intervention exploiting 60-Hz light entrainment to transiently remove perineuronal nets (PNNs), a rigid extracellular matrix that stabilizes synapses and locks the brain in a fixed functional state. Our discovery, originating from the ERC Starting Grant (StG), has demonstrated improved cognitive performance in mice through microglia-mediated removal of PNNs in a controlled and brain region-specific manner, without the invasive and potentially harmful effects of enzymatic interventions.\n\nThe project's primary objectives are to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this intervention in a preclinical mouse model, targeting anxiety disorder and PTSD, and to identify the optimal stage of fear memory formation for the highest benefit from 60-Hz entrainment. We will refine treatment length, repetition frequency, and validate physiological parameters as indicators of therapeutic success. The expected outcomes include the refinement of our prototype, establishing a therapeutic framework for clinical translation post-ERC Proof of Concept (PoC), and laying the groundwork for a spin-off company.\n\nOur solution is a targeted approach that is non-pharmacological, environmentally friendly, and applicable to both sexes, which stands to revolutionize the treatment landscape for mental health conditions. By achieving the outlined objectives, this project aims to move a significant step closer to a non-invasive, efficacious treatment that could profoundly improve the lives of millions suffering from mental health disorders.\n\nKeywords: mental health, 60-Hz light entrainment, perineuronal nets, non-invasive therapy, anxiety, PTSD, cognitive performance, preclinical model.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: 60-Hz Light Entrainment to Unlock Mental Health Conditions\n\nThe escalating burden of mental health disorders, such as anxiety and PTSD, on society necessitates innovative therapeutic interventions beyond the moderate-to-weak efficacy of current psychiatric medications. The proposed project explores a groundbreaking, non-invasive, and non-pharmacological approach using 60-Hz light entrainment to transiently remove the perineuronal net (PNN), a rigid extracellular matrix that restricts neuroplasticity and cognitive function. This intervention has demonstrated improved cognitive performance in preclinical mouse models and offers a targeted and environmentally-friendly solution to mental health challenges.\n\nThe project objectives are to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 60-Hz light entrainment in a preclinical mouse model, identify the optimal stage for intervention during fear memory formation, and determine the appropriate treatment length and frequency. Success will be measured against validated physiological parameters, ensuring the intervention's effectiveness. The outcomes of this research are expected to include the refinement of a prototype for 60-Hz light entrainment, the establishment of a therapeutic framework for future clinical studies, and the potential foundation of a spin-off company.\n\nThis research project represents a significant advancement in the field of mental health therapeutics, moving away from invasive and pharmacological interventions toward a solution that is both user-friendly and sustainable. By targeting the PNN in a controlled, brain region-specific manner, 60-Hz light entrainment could revolutionize the treatment of mental health conditions and offer hope to those for whom traditional medications have been ineffective. The project's successful completion will pave the way for clinical trials and ultimately transform the landscape of mental health care.\n\nKeywords: Mental Health, Non-Invasive Therapeutic Intervention, 60-Hz Light Entrainment, Perineuronal Net, Cognitive Performance, Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, Preclinical Mouse Model.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe escalating burden of mental health conditions such as anxiety disorder and PTSD on society necessitates the development of innovative therapeutic interventions. Current psychiatric medications, targeting synapse signaling imbalances, demonstrate only moderate-to-weak efficacy. The proposal \"60-Hz light entrainment to unlock mental health conditions\" presents a groundbreaking, non-pharmacological approach to treat mental health disorders by leveraging light entrainment technology.\n\nThe project's fundamental discovery, originating from an ERC_StG grant, is that non-invasive external light entrainment at a frequency of 60-Hz can transiently remove the perineuronal net (PNN) — a rigid extracellular matrix locking the brain in a functional state — in a controlled, brain region-specific manner. Enzymatic interventions previously evaluated in mice proved invasive and unsuitable for human therapeutics. In contrast, our proposed method significantly improved cognitive performance in mice, applicable to both sexes, without the invasiveness of prior models.\n\nThe objectives of the ERC_PoC-funded phase include evaluating the therapeutic potential in a preclinical mouse model, identifying the stage of fear memory formation with the highest benefit from 60-Hz entrainment, adjusting treatment length and repetition frequency, and validating physiological parameters as a success criterion. The expected outcomes are the refinement of the first prototype, setting the therapeutic framework for subsequent clinical studies, and laying the foundation for a spin-off company.\n\nThis targeted, non-invasive, and environmentally friendly therapeutic intervention offers a novel solution for mental health conditions. By establishing a new therapeutic frame that circumvents the limitations of current pharmacological treatments, we aim to unlock the potential for significant advancements in the field of mental health care and provide a foundation for future clinical applications.\n\nKeywords: 60-Hz light entrainment, mental health, non-invasive therapy, perineuronal net, anxiety disorder, PTSD, cognitive performance, preclinical mouse model.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe escalating burden of mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders and PTSD, necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies beyond the moderate efficacy of current psychiatric medications. The \"60-Hz light entrainment to unlock mental health conditions\" project proposes a groundbreaking approach that leverages non-invasive light entrainment to transiently remove the perineuronal net (PNN). PNNs are rigid extracellular matrix structures that stabilize synapses and are implicated in the persistence of certain mental health conditions.\n\nThe proposed research aims to harness 60-Hz light entrainment, discovered as part of an ERC Starting Grant, as a targeted, non-invasive, non-pharmacological, and environmentally friendly therapeutic intervention. In preclinical models, this intervention has shown to improve cognitive performance in mice by enabling microglia to remove PNNs in a brain region-specific manner.\n\nThe primary objectives of the ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) grant are to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 60-Hz light entrainment in preclinical mouse models of anxiety disorder and PTSD, determine the optimal stage of fear memory formation for intervention, refine treatment length and repetition frequency, and establish physiological parameters as criteria for therapeutic success. The expected outcomes include the refinement of a first prototype, creation of a therapeutic frame for future clinical studies, and laying the groundwork for a spin-off company.\n\nBy targeting PNNs through a novel, non-pharmacological method, this project holds the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for mental health conditions, offering a promising alternative to traditional pharmacological interventions. Its success could transform the approach to mental health treatment, with significant implications for patients, healthcare systems, and society at large."

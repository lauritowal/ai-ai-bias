        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Wearable Augmented Reality 3D Displays\" targets the revolutionization of wearable display technology by addressing key limitations that have persisted over the past few decades. Despite rapid advancements in the field, current wearable displays are hindered by a restricted field-of-view, viewing discomfort, and a lack of essential 3D depth cues, which are crucial for a truly immersive interactive augmented reality (AR) experience.\n\nThis proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to overcome these technological challenges, aiming to create a natural and intuitive user experience akin to wearing a pair of eyeglasses. The project's primary objectives are to eliminate the need for relay lenses, thereby enabling the miniaturization of wearable displays, and to provide all essential 3D depth cues to eliminate perceptual errors and avoid viewing discomfort. By enabling the eyes to fixate at the correct depth of objects without losing resolution, and eliminating the conflict between accommodation and convergence, the proposed solutions will lead to a new benchmark in wearable display technology.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the development of a natural-looking interactive 3D display with a very wide field-of-view exceeding 100 degrees, all within an eyeglasses form factor. These advancements will not only push the boundaries of current wearable displays but also ignite new research directions for intelligent human-computer interfaces and enriched AR applications. The project has the potential to set a precedent for future wearable technologies, propelling the field into a new era of user-friendly, accessible, and advanced AR experiences.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Wearable Augmented Reality 3D Displays\" project seeks to innovate the domain of interactive augmented reality (AR) by addressing the current technological challenges hindering the evolution of wearable displays. Despite rapid advancements in the past few decades, existing AR systems still contend with a limited field-of-view, viewing discomfort, and a lack of essential 3D depth cues. This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to revolutionize wearable AR technologies by achieving a natural looking and interactive 3D experience akin to wearing a simple pair of eyeglasses.\n\nOur primary objectives are twofold: to eliminate the need for relay lenses, thus enabling the miniaturization of wearable displays, and to provide all essential 3D depth cues to ensure an immersive and comfortable visual experience without perceptual errors. By focusing on these challenges, we aim to enable the eyes to fixate at the correct depth of objects seamlessly and to eliminate the accommodation-convergence conflict that often leads to discomfort in current systems.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the realization of a wearable display with a very wide field-of-view, exceeding 100 degrees, that maintains high resolution. This technology will not only push the boundaries of AR, enabling new research directions but also establish a new standard for intelligent human-computer interfaces.\n\nThrough the Wear3D proposal, we are poised to create a paradigm shift beyond state-of-the-art in wearable displays, significantly impacting the field of AR and opening the door to a plethora of applications in both professional and everyday settings.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Wearable Augmented Reality 3D Displays,\" seeks to revolutionize the field of interactive augmented reality (AR) by addressing the critical technological limitations that have hindered the development of truly natural and comfortable wearable displays. Despite rapid advancements in the past few decades, current AR systems are plagued by a narrow field-of-view, viewing discomfort, and the absence of essential 3D depth cues, all of which detract from a user's immersive experience.\n\nThis proposal is poised to tackle these challenges by eliminating the need for relay lenses, which are a major obstacle to miniaturization and are responsible for many perceptual errors. By removing these lenses and providing essential 3D depth cues, the project aims to enable the eyes to fixate at the correct depth of displayed objects without resolution loss, and to eliminate the conflict between accommodation and convergence that often leads to user discomfort.\n\nOur objectives are ambitious yet attainable: to create a wearable AR display that boasts a very wide field-of-view of over 100 degrees, while maintaining the form factor of everyday eyeglasses. The expected outcomes of this project include a natural looking interactive 3D experience that far exceeds current state-of-the-art, setting new research directions for intelligent human-computer interfaces and augmented reality applications.\n\nBy leveraging advancements in micro-technologies for the miniaturization of wearable AR displays, this proposal stands to make significant contributions to the domain of real 3D AR, offering potential impacts that reach beyond the current technological landscape into the realm of everyday practical use.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Wearable Augmented Reality 3D Displays\" (Wear3D), addresses the urgent need to revolutionize wearable display technology. Despite rapid advancements in the field over the past decades, current systems are hampered by a limited field-of-view, technological constraints, and viewing discomfort, primarily due to the absence of 3D depth cues. The Wear3D project aims to overcome these limitations by eliminating bulky relay lenses and providing essential 3D depth cues to ensure a natural viewing experience.\n\nOur objectives include the miniaturization of wearable displays to an eyeglasses form factor and the resolution of the accommodation-convergence conflict which causes perceptual errors. By enabling the eyes to fixate at the correct depth without losing resolution, the proposed technology will markedly improve the quality of interactive 3D augmented reality (AR).\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project are groundbreaking: a natural-looking and interactive 3D experience with a wide field-of-view exceeding 100 degrees, all within a wearable display as natural and unobtrusive as a pair of eyeglasses. These advancements promise to not only extend the state-of-the-art in wearable displays but also to open new research directions for intelligent human-computer interfaces and AR applications across various domains.\n\nThe Wear3D proposal is poised to create a paradigm shift in the way we interact with digital content, propelling us towards a future where augmented reality is seamlessly integrated into our daily lives."

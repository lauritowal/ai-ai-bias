        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"MacroAutophagy and Necrotic Neurodegeneration in Ageing\" project aims to unravel the intricate relationship between autophagy and neuron death in the context of aging, with an emphasis on the mechanisms of cargo-specific macroautophagy. Necrotic neurodegeneration is a critical factor in the pathology of stroke, ischemia, and age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, with vulnerability to necrosis increasing as organisms age. This research proposal focuses on understanding how the decline in autophagic flux, which is known to occur with age, influences the susceptibility of neurons to necrosis. \n\nThe proposed study will leverage the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian models to investigate the molecular determinants of neuron vulnerability. The objectives include monitoring the autophagic flux of organellar cargo during neurodegeneration, identifying mediators of organelle-specific autophagy in neurons, conducting genome-wide screens to find modifiers of age-inflicted neurodegeneration, and investigating the functional conservation of these processes in mammalian models. Cutting-edge methodologies such as C. elegans genetics, in vivo neuronal imaging, and microfluidics technology will be employed to achieve these aims.\n\nOur recent findings suggest that organelle-specific autophagy is a key determinant of longevity, and the proposed research will build on these insights to explore how modulation of autophagy through conditions like low insulin/IGF1 signaling and dietary restriction can influence lifespan. By investigating the evolutionary conservation of these mechanisms, the study promises to provide profound insights into the aging process and offer potential avenues to improve human health and quality of life. This research holds the promise of advancing our understanding of age-related neurodegeneration, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies to combat these devastating conditions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: MacroAutophagy and Necrotic Neurodegeneration in Ageing\n\nThe intricate mechanisms underlying necrotic neurodegeneration during ageing remain a significant scientific enigma. This proposal, titled \"MacroAutophagy and Necrotic Neurodegeneration in Ageing,\" aims to elucidate the role of cargo-specific macroautophagy in the vulnerability of neurons to necrosis as organisms age, with a particular focus on the decline of autophagic fluxâ€”a process known to influence longevity under conditions of low insulin/IGF1 signalling and dietary restriction. Utilizing both Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian models, this research will bridge the gap in our understanding of age-related pathologies such as stroke, ischemia, and neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nOur objectives include: (1) monitoring the autophagic flux of organellar cargo under neurodegenerative and lifespan-altering conditions; (2) identifying mediators and conducting genome-wide screens for modifiers of age-inflicted neurodegeneration; (3) interrogating nematode models to understand the relationship between organelle-specific autophagy and susceptibility to necrosis; and (4) investigating the functional conservation of these mechanisms in mammalian models of neuronal necrosis.\n\nWe will employ a comprehensive methodology, integrating C. elegans genetics, advanced in vivo neuronal imaging, and cutting-edge microfluidics technology, to dissect the molecular determinants of organelle-specific autophagy. Our recent findings suggest that such autophagy is a key determinant of longevity and is evolutionarily conserved, underscoring its potential relevance to human health.\n\nThe proposed study promises to deliver groundbreaking insights into the modulation of neurodegeneration by ageing. It will advance our understanding of the fundamental science of ageing and neurodegeneration, offering potential strategies to improve quality of life and inform therapeutic interventions for age-associated neurological disorders.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"MacroAutophagy and Necrotic Neurodegeneration in Ageing\" project aims to elucidate the complex mechanisms of necrotic neurodegeneration that are modulated by ageing, with a focus on the role of cargo-specific macroautophagy. This critical research initiative addresses the increasing vulnerability to devastating pathologies such as stroke, ischemia, and age-associated neurodegenerative disorders in both Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. We propose to explore the dual roles of autophagy as both a pro-survival and pro-death process, particularly how autophagic flux declines with age and how autophagy induction under longevity-promoting conditions, such as low insulin/IGF1 signaling and dietary restriction, can modulate lifespan across diverse taxa.\n\nRecent findings highlight that organelle-specific autophagy, including selective degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy), peroxisomes (pexophagy), and nuclei (nucleophagy), is a determinant of longevity. Our research will leverage innovative methodologies, including C. elegans genetics, in vivo neuronal imaging, and microfluidics technology, to monitor the autophagic flux of organellar cargo during conditions of neurodegeneration and lifespan alteration. We aim to identify mediators of organelle-specific autophagy in neurons, conduct genome-wide screens for modifiers of age-inflicted neurodegeneration, and interrogate nematode models for their susceptibility to necrosis through the lens of organelle-specific autophagy.\n\nBy investigating functional conservation in mammalian models, we will extend our findings to human health, providing insights into the evolutionary conservation of these mechanisms. The outcomes of this study promise to deepen our understanding of age-related neurodegeneration and offer potential strategies to improve quality of life for the ageing population.\n\nKeywords: Macroautophagy, Necrotic Neurodegeneration, Ageing, Caenorhabditis elegans, Organelle-specific Autophagy, Longevity, Stroke, Ischemia, Neurodegenerative Disorders.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"MacroAutophagy and Necrotic Neurodegeneration in Ageing\" aims to elucidate the complex interplay between macroautophagy and neuron vulnerability to necrosis within the context of ageing. Age-related pathologies, such as stroke, ischemia, and neurodegenerative disorders, demonstrate increased susceptibility to necrotic neurodegeneration, a process modulated by ageing. Our study will use Caenorhabditis elegans and human models to investigate how autophagy, a cellular degradation mechanism, contributes to lifespan regulation and neurodegeneration, shifting between pro-survival and pro-death roles as autophagic flux declines with age.\n\nOur recent findings suggest that organelle-specific autophagy, including processes like mitophagy, pexophagy, and nucleophagy, is a critical determinant of longevity that is evolutionarily conserved. The research will focus on monitoring organellar cargo-specific macroautophagy during neurodegeneration, identifying mediators of this selective autophagy in neurons, and conducting genome-wide screens for modifiers of age-related neurodegeneration. Additionally, we will interrogate nematode models to understand organelle-specific autophagy's role in necrosis susceptibility and lifespan alteration, and investigate whether these mechanisms are conserved in mammalian models of neuronal necrosis.\n\nThe methodology will combine C. elegans genetics, in vivo neuronal imaging, and microfluidics technology to achieve our objectives. This comprehensive approach will provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of autophagy modulation by ageing and its implications for neurodegeneration. The findings of this study hold the potential to greatly impact our understanding of age-related neurodegeneration, offering insights relevant to human health and improving quality of life for ageing populations."

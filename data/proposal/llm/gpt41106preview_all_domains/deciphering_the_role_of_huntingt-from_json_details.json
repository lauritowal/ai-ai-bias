        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Deciphering the Role of Huntingtin in Energy Supply for Axonal Transport in Health and Huntington’s Disease\n\nFast axonal transport (FAT) is pivotal for the proper functioning of the brain, especially in the movement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a key protein involved in neuronal survival and function. This proposal seeks to unravel the role of huntingtin (HTT) in managing the energy supply required for FAT, particularly under conditions of high neuronal activity, and how these processes are disrupted in Huntington’s disease (HD).\n\nCentral to this research is the novel hypothesis that HTT is integral for coupling energy production directly to vesicular consumption by glycolytic enzymes, thereby facilitating efficient FAT. This coupling is especially critical during increased neuronal activity, where energy demand surges. In HD, pathogenic mutations in HTT may disrupt this energy supply, leading to a reduction in BDNF transport and contributing to neurodegeneration.\n\nThe project aims to investigate the energy sources powering FAT and their regulation by HTT, explore how HTT mutations affect both energy production and the neuronal response, and finally, attempt to restore these energy sources in HD models to rescue axonal transport and potentially slow neurodegeneration.\n\nThe impact of this research is manifold: it promises to significantly advance our understanding of how electrical activity and energy metabolism are regulated to maintain brain function, provide new insights into the normal and dysfunctional roles of HTT, and potentially open up novel therapeutic avenues for treating HD.\n\nFeasibility of the project is high, backed by a team with expertise in developing innovative microfluidic circuits for studying axonal transport, identifying new metabolic and signaling pathways, and extensive knowledge of HTT biology. This work will illuminate the crucial mechanisms by which neuronal activity sustains brain function through the regulation of energy metabolism, specifically for the transport of BDNF, both in health and in the pathology of HD.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Deciphering the Role of Huntingtin in Energy Supply for Axonal Transport in Health and Huntington’s Disease\n\nFast axonal transport (FAT) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for sustaining brain function and is critically influenced by the huntingtin (HTT) protein. Despite its significance, the regulatory mechanisms of BDNF by neuronal activity and the specific roles of HTT in this process are not well understood, particularly under pathological conditions such as Huntington's disease (HD). This proposal aims to explore the hypothesis that HTT is a vital element in coupling energy production to consumption for efficient FAT, and that alterations in HTT function due to pathogenic mutations are pivotal to disease progression.\n\nThe project objectives are threefold: to investigate the energy sources for axonal transport and how they are regulated by HTT in response to heightened neuronal activity; to elucidate the impact of pathogenic HTT mutations on the neuronal activity response and the energy production capacity of vesicles; and to attempt to restore energy sources in HD models to rescue axonal transport and attenuate neurodegeneration. Our research will provide critical insights into the regulation of energy metabolism for brain function and transport of BDNF, which is currently an unmet scientific need.\n\nThe proposed work is supported by the team's extensive expertise in developing innovative microfluidic circuits for studying axonal transport in reconstituted neuronal circuits, expertise in uncovering new metabolic and signaling pathways, and deep understanding of HTT biology. The anticipated outcomes include advancing the understanding of how electrical activity regulates energy metabolism to fuel transport, unveiling new knowledge on HTT function and dysfunction, and potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for HD. This project represents a significant step forward in addressing the intricate mechanisms underlying neuronal health and the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, \"Deciphering the Role of Huntingtin in Energy Supply for Axonal Transport in Health and Huntington’s Disease,\" aims to elucidate the critical function of the huntingtin protein (HTT) in fast axonal transport (FAT) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its implications for brain health and the pathology of Huntington's disease (HD). Given the essential role of FAT in brain function and the observed deficits in BDNF transport in HD, our study addresses significant gaps in understanding how neuronal activity regulates FAT and the specific involvement of HTT in this process.\n\nOur hypothesis posits that HTT is instrumental in coordinating energy production with consumption by molecular motors that drive FAT. We speculate that the pathogenic mutation in HTT pivotal to HD disrupts this critical energy channeling function, thereby contributing to the disease's progression. We further posit that directly restoring energy provision to vesicles could rescue axonal transport and attenuate neurodegeneration in HD.\n\nThe study is organized around three principal aims: (1) to investigate the energy sources for axonal transport and their regulation by HTT upon high neuronal activity, (2) to explore how a pathogenic mutation in HTT affects the response to neuronal activity and the vesicles' capacity to produce energy, and (3) to restore energy sources in HD to rescue axonal transport and slow neurodegeneration. \n\nOur work promises to advance our understanding of how electrical activity essential for brain function regulates energy metabolism to fuel transport, particularly the transport of BDNF. It will also reveal new knowledge on the normal and pathological functions of HTT, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for HD.\n\nThe feasibility of our proposal is underpinned by our team's recognized expertise in developing innovative microfluidic circuits for studying axonal transport, identifying new metabolic and signaling pathways, and deep familiarity with HTT biology. This research initiative stands to make a significant impact on the field of neurobiology and on the lives of those affected by HD.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Deciphering the Role of Huntingtin in Energy Supply for Axonal Transport in Health and Huntington’s Disease\" aims to illuminate the critical role of huntingtin (HTT) in regulating the energy supply required for the fast axonal transport (FAT) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an essential process for maintaining brain function. Despite its significance, the regulation of BDNF transport by neuronal activity, the specific energy sources for FAT, and the mechanisms by which these processes are impaired in Huntington's disease (HD) remain poorly understood.\n\nOur research hypothesizes that HTT is a pivotal factor in channeling energy to molecular motors for effective axonal transport, linking energy production to consumption. Moreover, we propose that the functional alteration of HTT in HD is a key determinant in disease progression. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) Investigate the energy sources for axonal transport and their regulation by HTT in response to heightened neuronal activity; 2) Explore how pathogenic mutations in HTT influence energy production and the vesicles' capacity for energy generation in response to neuronal activity; and 3) Attempt to restore energy sources in HD models to rescue axonal transport and decelerate neurodegeneration.\n\nThis study promises to significantly advance our understanding of how brain function modulates energy metabolism for transport, particularly the transport of BDNF. It will also shed light on the normal and dysfunctional roles of HTT, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for HD. The feasibility of this project is supported by our team's expertise in developing innovative microfluidic circuits for studying axonal transport in reconstituted neuronal circuits, identifying new metabolic and signaling pathways, and a solid background in HTT biology. This work stands to make a substantial impact on the field of neurodegenerative disease research."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Fast Filtering for Computer Graphics, Vision and Computational Sciences,\" aims to revolutionize the domain of digital signal processing, computer graphics, vision, and image processing by addressing the challenges posed by high-resolution sensors, time-consuming operations, and the necessity for high-CPU power. Traditional linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering techniques, which rely on convolution, suffer from computational complexity of O(N^2), while Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods offer a reduced complexity of O(N log N). However, there remain very few known optimal linear time procedures, especially for non-linear spatially-varying filters which have an exact application complexity of O(N^2) and acceleration methods that introduce issues such as increased space dimensions, severe memory costs, and truncation errors.\n\nThis research intends to derive fast, linear-time procedures for various types of LTI filters, exploiting the connection between convolution, spatially-homogeneous elliptic equations, and the multigrid method to enable efficient processing. We aim to develop novel multiscale filtering procedures that are edge-aware, both explicit and implicit, and non-linear spatially-varying. Furthermore, the project will introduce a novel multi-level image decomposition approach that mimics inhomogeneous diffusion operators. These advancements will be facilitated by leveraging ideas from multiscale matrix preconditioning and the design of new biorthogonal second-generation wavelets.\n\nThe centerpiece of this proposal is the formation of a new multiscale preconditioning paradigm that combines algebraic multigrid and combinatorial matrix preconditioning to overcome the fundamental shortcomings in the current domain. This project promises to deliver significant improvements in the efficiency and scalability of filtering operations, leading to broad implications and potential applications across a range of computational disciplines.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Fast Filtering for Computer Graphics, Vision and Computational Sciences,\" aims to revolutionize the efficiency of digital signal processing in various domains including computer graphics, vision, and image processing. Current filtering approaches face critical challenges, such as the time-intensive nature of operations with high-resolution sensors and the dependency on devices with significant CPU power. Traditional linear time-invariant (LTI) operations exhibit an O(N^2) complexity, while the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) offers a reduced complexity of O(N log N). Despite this, optimal linear-time procedures for LTI filters are scarce, and non-linear spatially-varying filters possess an exact application complexity of O(N^2). Furthermore, existing acceleration methods for these filters are hampered by issues such as high memory costs and severe truncation errors.\n\nThis research seeks to overcome these limitations by deriving fast, linear-time procedures for various LTI filters and developing efficient edge-aware filters that are both explicit and implicit. Our goals also include exploiting the connections between convolution, spatially-homogeneous elliptic equations, and the multigrid method to create novel multiscale filtering procedures. A key innovation will be the derivation of a novel multi-level image decomposition that mimics inhomogeneous diffusion operators, drawing inspiration from multiscale matrix preconditioning and the design of new biorthogonal second-generation wavelets.\n\nWe propose a groundbreaking new multiscale preconditioning paradigm that synergizes algebraic multigrid and combinatorial matrix preconditioning techniques to address fundamental shortcomings in the domain of digital signal processing. By advancing the state of the art in filter efficiency and functionality, our research holds the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities of devices operating under resource constraints and to open new prospects in high-resolution image and graphics processing.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Fast Filtering for Computer Graphics, Vision and Computational Sciences,\" seeks to address the critical challenge of optimizing filter operations in fields where time efficiency and computational resource constraints are paramount. Filters are integral to a multitude of applications in digital signal processing, computer graphics, vision, and image processing. However, current filtering techniques face significant hurdles such as being too time-consuming for high-resolution sensors and requiring devices with substantial CPU power. \n\nTraditional Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) transformations exhibit a quadratic complexity, while Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods offer a reduced complexity of O(N log N). Yet, for non-linear spatially-varying filters, the exact application complexity remains at O(N^2), and existing acceleration methods introduce issues like higher space dimension requirements, severe memory costs, and truncation errors. Recognizing the scarcity of optimal linear-time procedures, this proposal aims to derive fast, linear-time procedures for different types of LTI filters. \n\nThe research will exploit connections between convolution, spatially-homogeneous elliptic equations, and the multigrid method to develop novel multiscale filtering procedures and efficient edge-aware filters, both explicit and implicit. Furthermore, the project seeks to derive a novel multi-level image decomposition that mimics inhomogeneous diffusion operators and design new biorthogonal second-generation wavelets using ideas from multiscale matrix preconditioning. A groundbreaking multiscale preconditioning paradigm will be outlined, combining algebraic multigrid and combinatorial matrix preconditioning to overcome fundamental shortcomings in this domain.\n\nThe successful execution of this project promises to revolutionize filtering processes, making them faster and more accessible for a wide array of computational applications, thereby enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of various technologies relying on complex image and signal processing tasks.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Fast Filtering for Computer Graphics, Vision and Computational Sciences\n\nThe evolution of high-resolution sensors and intricate computational methods in fields such as digital signal processing, computer graphics, vision, and image processing has introduced a critical demand for faster and more efficient filtering techniques. Current filtering procedures, particularly for linear time-invariant (LTI) and non-linear spatially-varying filters, pose significant challenges due to their computational complexity, high memory costs, and time-consuming operations, which are currently exacerbated at high resolutions and on devices with limited CPU power.\n\nThis proposal aims to address these fundamental shortcomings by deriving fast, linear-time procedures for various filter types, including LTI and efficient edge-aware filters, both explicit and implicit. We intend to exploit the intrinsic connection between convolution, spatially-homogeneous elliptic equations, and the multigrid method to not only improve existing filtering processes but also to develop novel multiscale filtering procedures that mimic inhomogeneous diffusion operators.\n\nOur research goals include the derivation of novel multi-level image decomposition strategies that can efficiently analyze, process, and synthesize images. These strategies will be inspired by multiscale matrix preconditioning and will contribute to the design of new biorthogonal second-generation wavelets. Moreover, we propose to establish a new multiscale preconditioning paradigm that synergizes algebraic multigrid with combinatorial matrix preconditioning, overcoming the severe memory costs and truncation errors associated with acceleration methods for non-linear filters.\n\nThe anticipated outcome is a significant leap forward in the efficiency and capability of computer graphics and image processing applications, allowing for rapid and accurate filtering processes even in resource-constrained environments. This project holds the promise of catalyzing advancements across a multitude of computational disciplines that depend on sophisticated filtering techniques."

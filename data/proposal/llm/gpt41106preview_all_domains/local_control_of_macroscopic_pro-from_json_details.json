        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Local Control of Macroscopic Properties in Isolated Many-body Quantum Systems\" (LoCoMacro) proposes a groundbreaking study on the nonequilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum systems. Historically, the focus has been on understanding the equilibrium properties of such systems, typically in the context of their interaction with an environment. However, recent experimental advancements with ultra-cold, trapped atoms have allowed for the observation of many-body systems that are nearly isolated. These advancements have sparked considerable interest in the study of nonequilibrium dynamics, particularly in the context of inhomogeneous systems.\n\nLoCoMacro aims to explore and control the macroscopic properties of nonequilibrium states through localized interventions. The project is centered on a set of challenging research questions including the nature of relaxation in inhomogeneous systems, the emergence of nonequilibrium steady states, and the effects of localized perturbations on dynamics. The phenomena of interest include a new kind of relaxation that occurs without dissipation and the global effects of localized perturbations on stationary properties.\n\nThe proposed research will employ advanced analytic techniques to obtain exact results for correlation functions and entanglement measures in integrable models, alongside state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The project seeks to bridge topics such as thermalization in homogeneous systems and many-body localization in disordered systems.\n\nLoCoMacroâ€™s objectives include controlling the macroscopic properties by acting on a part of the system, studying the effects of localized perturbations, and obtaining exact results in integrable models. The insights gained could revolutionize our understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics in many-body quantum systems and pave the way for novel technological applications where manipulation and stabilization of quantum states are key.\n\nKeywords: many-body quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, localized perturbations, inhomogeneous systems, thermalization, many-body localization, ultra-cold atoms.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Local Control of Macroscopic Properties in Isolated Many-body Quantum Systems (LoCoMacro)\n\nThe LoCoMacro project represents a groundbreaking endeavor to manipulate and understand macroscopic properties of nonequilibrium states in many-body quantum systems through localized interventions. Historically, the study of many-body quantum systems has focused on equilibrium properties and their coupling with the environment. However, recent experimental advancements with ultra-cold, trapped atoms have opened new avenues for exploring nonequilibrium dynamics in systems that are nearly isolated from environmental influences. This shift in focus has revealed a novel kind of relaxation process, one that occurs without dissipation and is profoundly influenced by localized perturbations.\n\nLoCoMacro is poised to exploit these recent insights by aiming to control macroscopic properties of a nonequilibrium state by specifically acting on part of the system. The project will address key research questions concerning the relaxation in inhomogeneous systems, the emergence of nonequilibrium steady states, and the effects of localized perturbations on system dynamics. To achieve these objectives, the project will integrate advanced analytic techniques and state-of-the-art numerical simulations. It will provide exact results in integrable models, study the impact of localized perturbations, and construct correlation functions and entanglement measures.\n\nBy bridging crucial topics such as thermalization in homogeneous systems and many-body localization in disordered systems, LoCoMacro will not only deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium dynamics but also establish methods for exerting local control over global properties. This innovative approach promises to unveil new phenomena and advance our ability to manipulate quantum systems for technological applications. The success of LoCoMacro will signify a significant leap forward in the field of quantum mechanics, with implications for both fundamental science and practical quantum engineering.",

Traditionally, research has focused on the equilibrium properties of these systems and their interactions with an environment. However, recent experimental advancements with ultra-cold, trapped atoms have opened the avenue to study these systems in nearly isolated conditions, bringing the intriguing phenomena of relaxation without dissipation to the forefront of quantum physics research.\n\nLoCoMacro aims to revolutionize our understanding by demonstrating how macroscopic properties of nonequilibrium states can be controlled through localized interventions. This project will delve into the relaxation processes in inhomogeneous systems, the emergence of nonequilibrium steady states, and the overarching effects of localized perturbations on the dynamics of the system. The research questions are framed to unravel how a localized perturbation can induce global changes in the stationary properties of these complex systems.\n\nThe approach to achieve these aims combines advanced analytic techniques to obtain exact results for correlation functions and entanglement measures in integrable models, along with state-of-the-art numerical simulations. This dual methodology will bridge critical topics in quantum physics, such as thermalization in homogeneous systems and many-body localization in disordered systems, thereby enriching our understanding of quantum dynamics.\n\nIn summary, LoCoMacro represents a groundbreaking exploration into controlling the macroscopic properties of a nonequilibrium state through localized measures.

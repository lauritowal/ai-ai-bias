        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Reprogramming Conformation by Fluorination: Exploring New Areas of Chemical Space\" aims to bridge the gap between the low natural occurrence of organofluorine compounds (only 12 known to date) and their significant representation in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, where they constitute up to 40% of the materials used. Traditional fluorination patterns, such as perfluorination and single-site fluorination, typically yield achiral or 2D/3D achiral products. This project confronts the substantial synthetic challenges that arise when preparing stereochemically defined multiply fluorinated systems, which include the need for substrate pre-functionalisation via oxidation, competing substitution/elimination reactions, and the difficulty in maintaining enantiopurity during the synthesis of optically active fluorides.\n\nThe principal aim of RECON (Reprogramming Conformation) is to facilitate the exploration of 3D chiral space, thereby unlocking a previously inaccessible area of chemical space. The methodology involves using simple feedstock and inexpensive, commercially available fluoride sources to access multiply fluorinated, stereochemically complex organofluorine materials. The expected outcomes include the establishment of a modular platform for the rational placement of functional groups on a structural basis, which is anticipated to accelerate the discovery of next-generation materials across various disciplines, including medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, material sciences, and bio-medicine.\n\nThis grant proposal details an innovative approach that promises to redefine the way we think about and utilize fluorination in complex molecular design, potentially leading to breakthroughs in diverse fields that rely on highly specific and functional organofluorine materials.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Reprogramming Conformation by Fluorination: Exploring New Areas of Chemical Space\n\nWith an astonishing 40% of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals containing fluorinated materials, the relevance of organofluorine compounds cannot be overstated. Yet, the occurrence of naturally fluorinated organic compounds is limited, with a mere 12 known examples. Current synthetic methods primarily yield achiral, or stereochemically simplistic materials through perfluorination or single-site fluorination. These methods fall short in the synthesis of stereochemically rich, multiply fluorinated systems due to challenges such as the need for substrate pre-functionalization via oxidation, competing substitution/elimination reactions, and the compromise of enantiopurity during deoxyfluorination.\n\nThe proposed project aims to overcome these limitations and facilitate the exploration of three-dimensional, chiral chemical space. Our methodology involves the development of novel synthetic approaches, utilizing simple feedstock and inexpensive, commercially available fluoride sources, to access stereochemically complex, multiply fluorinated organofluorine materials. We anticipate the establishment of a modular platform that allows for rational functional placement on a structural basis, significantly accelerating the discovery and development of next-generation materials.\n\nOur interdisciplinary approach targets key disciplines such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, material sciences, and bio-medicine, promising to bridge the gap between current limitations and the vast potential of organofluorine chemistry. The expected outcomes include new paradigms in the synthesis of organofluorine compounds and groundbreaking advancements in the fields of therapeutic agents, agrochemicals, and novel material development. This research has the potential to redefine the boundaries of chemical space, ushering in a new era of scientific discovery and innovation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: \"Reprogramming Conformation by Fluorination: Exploring New Areas of Chemical Space\"\n\nDespite the fact that only 12 naturally occurring organofluorine compounds have been identified, fluorinated molecules represent a significant proportion (40%) of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Current fluorination methods, such as perfluorination and single-site fluorination, predominantly yield achiral, two-dimensional structures. The synthesis of stereochemically defined, multiply fluorinated systems poses several challenges, including the requirement for substrate pre-functionalization via oxidation, the competing substitution/elimination reactions during deoxyfluorination, and the difficulty in preserving enantiopurity in the synthesis of optically active fluorides.\n\nThis proposal aims to facilitate the exploration of three-dimensional, chiral chemical space by developing access to multiply fluorinated, stereochemically complex organofluorine materials from simple feedstocks using inexpensive, commercially available fluoride sources. Our innovative methodology promises to overcome the existing synthetic limitations and provide a modular platform for the rational placement of functional groups on a structural basis, thereby accelerating the discovery of next-generation materials.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include the creation of novel, chiral organofluorine compounds with potential applications across multiple disciplines, such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, material sciences, and bio-medicine. By addressing the current synthetic challenges, our project will open new avenues for the design and synthesis of functionally diverse molecules, with the potential to impact significantly on the development of advanced therapeutics, agrochemicals, and biomaterials.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Reprogramming Conformation by Fluorination: Exploring New Areas of Chemical Space\n\nDespite the limited natural occurrence of organofluorine compounds, with only 12 known examples, their presence in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals is substantial, constituting around 40% of such materials. Current fluorination strategies, such as perfluorination and single-site fluorination, typically yield achiral, two-dimensional chemical structures. However, the synthesis of stereochemically defined, multiply fluorinated systems presents significant challenges, including the necessity for substrate pre-functionalization via oxidation, difficulties associated with competing substitution/elimination reactions, and the loss of enantiopurity during the synthesis of optically active fluorides.\n\nOur project, \"Reprogramming Conformation by Fluorination,\" aims to overcome these obstacles and facilitate exploration of three-dimensional, chiral chemical space. By utilizing simple feedstock and inexpensive, commercially available fluoride sources, we propose a novel approach to access multiply fluorinated, stereochemically complex organofluorine materials.

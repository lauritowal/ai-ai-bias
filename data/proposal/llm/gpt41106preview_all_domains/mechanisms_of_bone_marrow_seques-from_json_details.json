        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Mechanisms of bone marrow sequestration during malaria infection\n\nMalaria continues to be a major public health threat, causing an estimated 600,000 deaths annually, predominantly among children in sub-Saharan Africa. A critical challenge in combating this disease is the widespread resistance to current treatments. The proposed research aims to address this urgent need by investigating novel therapies targeting the sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (RBCs) in the bone marrow—a key virulence factor and critical step in the RBC cycle.\n\nRecent findings suggest that the bone marrow serves as a niche for both asexual parasite replication and gametocyte development, which are essential for disease transmission. The project, an innovative multidisciplinary proposal, will focus on the interface between infected RBCs and the bone marrow vasculature. The research questions poised to guide this study are: How do parasites home to bone marrow? What changes occur in the bone marrow endothelium upon infection? How do parasites adhere to and transmigrate across the bone marrow vascular endothelium?\n\nUsing a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, including a mouse model that has confirmed an asexual reservoir in the bone marrow, this proposal aims to provide a detailed characterization of the host-pathogen interactions at this critical juncture. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive understanding of the sequestration mechanisms and identification of potential new avenues for intervention strategies. By elucidating the intricate processes of RBC sequestration in the bone marrow, the research holds the promise to open up innovative therapeutic strategies that could circumvent the current resistance issue and profoundly impact malaria control and prevention.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Mechanisms of Bone Marrow Sequestration during Malaria Infection\n\nMalaria continues to be a public health crisis, claiming over 600,000 lives annually, predominantly affecting children in sub-Saharan Africa. The causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, has developed widespread resistance to current treatments, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. A critical aspect of P. falciparum's virulence is the sequestration of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) in deep tissues, which is essential for the parasite's life cycle and evasion of spleen-based clearance. Recent findings suggest that the bone marrow serves as a significant site for parasite sequestration and a reservoir for both asexually replicating parasites and gametocytes, the latter being crucial for transmission.\n\nOur innovative multidisciplinary proposal aims to unravel the host-pathogen interactions at the interface between iRBCs and the bone marrow vasculature. We will address pivotal research questions: How do parasites home to the bone marrow? What changes occur in the bone marrow endothelium upon infection? How do parasites adhere to and transmigrate across the bone marrow vascular endothelium? These questions will be explored using state-of-the-art techniques to achieve a detailed characterization of the interactions between malaria parasites and the host vasculature.\n\nThe expected outcomes include a comprehensive understanding of the sequestration mechanisms and identification of potential targets for intervention. This research has the potential to open new avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting parasite sequestration and transmission, addressing the pressing issue of drug resistance, and ultimately reducing the burden of malaria. By focusing on these under-investigated aspects of malaria pathogenesis, our study stands to make a significant impact on public health in regions devastated by the disease.",
        "Abstract:\n\nMalaria remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases, with an estimated 600,000 annual deaths, predominantly among children in sub-Saharan Africa. The causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, has developed widespread resistance to current treatments, underscoring an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Our proposal, \"Mechanisms of bone marrow sequestration during malaria infection,\" aims to explore the understudied aspect of malaria pathogenesis—the sequestration of infected red blood cells (RBCs) within the bone marrow.\n\nRecent studies have identified the human bone marrow as a critical site for both gametocyte development and a reservoir for asexually replicating parasites. This sequestration is essential for the parasite's life cycle and survival, enabling evasion from splenic clearance. However, the mechanisms by which P. falciparum RBCs home to and interact with the bone marrow vasculature remain poorly understood.\n\nThis innovative, multidisciplinary research project will focus on host-pathogen interactions at the interface between infected RBCs and bone marrow vasculature. Our primary research questions include: How do parasites home to bone marrow? What changes occur in the bone marrow endothelium upon infection? And, how do parasites adhere to and transmigrate across the bone marrow vascular endothelium?\n\nAnswering these questions is anticipated to provide a detailed characterization of the interaction between malaria parasites and host vasculature, which has potential to open new avenues for intervention strategies. The outcomes of this study could lead to the development of therapies targeting the sequestration process, thus preventing the progression of infection and transmission of the disease.\n\nThrough this proposal, we seek to generate valuable insights that could revolutionize the current understanding of malaria pathogenesis and facilitate the creation of more effective treatments, ultimately reducing the global burden of this devastating disease.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Mechanisms of Bone Marrow Sequestration During Malaria Infection\n\nMalaria remains a devastating public health problem, claiming over 600,000 lives annually, primarily among children in sub-Saharan Africa. The emergence of widespread resistance to current treatments underscores the urgent need for novel therapies. This innovative, multidisciplinary grant proposal aims to investigate the host-pathogen interactions at the interface between infected red blood cells and the bone marrow vasculature of humans infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The project targets a critical yet understudied aspect of malaria pathology: the sequestration of infected red blood cells in the bone marrow, which is essential for the parasite's life cycle completion and the development of gametocytes, the transmission stage of the parasite.\n\nRecent findings have confirmed the existence of an asexual parasite reservoir within the bone marrow, and the extracellular environment of the bone marrow is now recognized as a key location for gametocyte development. Building on these discoveries, our research will address three pivotal questions: (1) How do parasites home to the bone marrow? (2) What changes occur in the bone marrow endothelium upon infection? (3) How do parasites adhere to and transmigrate across the bone marrow vascular endothelium?\n\nThrough a detailed characterization of the interactions between the malaria parasite and the host vasculature, this research is expected to illuminate a new paradigm in malaria pathogenesis. The outcomes will not only advance scientific understanding but also have the potential to open new avenues for the development of intervention strategies. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial for devising innovative treatments to combat the malaria burden and save lives, particularly in regions where resistance to current therapies is a significant challenge."

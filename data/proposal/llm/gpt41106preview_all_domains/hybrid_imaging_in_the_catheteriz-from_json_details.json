        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Hybrid Imaging in the Catheterization Room\n\nThe proposed project, \"Hybrid Imaging in the Catheterization Room,\" aims to extend the application of the patented c-arm scanner technology, IXSI, previously developed under the ERC CoG, from oncology to interventional cardiology. With nearly one million percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures annually in the U.S. alone, the integration of IXSI into cardiac interventions represents a significant advancement with extensive commercial potential.\n\nThe project will consist of four main objectives: (i) to assess the benefits and market share of IXSI for cardiology patients and treatments, (ii) to evaluate the performance of IXSI in a cardiological setting using custom testing devices, (iii) to investigate the cost-effectiveness of IXSI for cardiology through potential hardware modifications, and (iv) to develop a robust business case for the utilization of IXSI in cardiac interventions.\n\nOur expected outcome is to demonstrate that IXSI can significantly aid cardiac interventions, thereby facilitating faster clinical implementation. This would revolutionize the process of determining the culprit vessel during procedures and evaluating treatment outcomes, offering a new standard of care in interventional cardiology.\n\nThis ERC Proof of Concept project not only promises to enhance patient outcomes through improved imaging techniques but also anticipates a considerable commercial incentive due to the massive application field. The successful completion of this project will establish the foundation for the rapid commercialization of IXSI in interventional cardiology, potentially transforming the landscape of cardiac care.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Hybrid Imaging in the Catheterization Room\" project proposes the exploration and expansion of the patented c-arm scanner technology, known as IXSI, into the field of interventional cardiology. Originally developed and patented under an ERC Consolidator Grant (ERC CoG) and currently utilized in oncology, IXSI technology has demonstrated significant potential for use in cardiac interventions. The project seeks funding from the ERC Proof of Concept to assess IXSI's benefits for cardiology patients and treatments, evaluate its performance using custom testing devices, investigate cost-effectiveness through hardware modifications, and develop a comprehensive business case for its application in cardiac interventions.\n\nThe objectives of the project are fourfold: (i) to investigate the benefits and market share of IXSI for various cardiology patient groups and treatments, (ii) to evaluate the performance of IXSI in the cardiology setting with specially designed testing devices, (iii) to conduct a study on the cost-effectiveness of the technology with potential hardware modifications, and (iv) to develop a business case that supports the use of IXSI in cardiac intervention procedures. The expected outcome includes accelerated clinical implementation for cardiac interventions, leveraging the IXSI technology to determine culprit vessels during procedures and evaluate treatment outcomes more effectively.\n\nWith an estimated annual volume of close to 1 million percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures in the US alone, IXSI's new application in interventional cardiology represents a significant commercial opportunity. The project aims to capitalize on this potential, promising to enhance clinical practices and outcomes in cardiac care while tapping into a large and growing market.",

This ERC Proof of Concept proposal seeks to investigate the potential benefits and market viability of IXSI for cardiology patients and treatments, especially in the context of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) procedures, which are estimated to occur close to one million times annually in the United States alone.\n\nThe project's objectives are four-fold: (i) to assess the benefit and market share of IXSI for cardiology patient groups and treatments, (ii) to evaluate the performance of IXSI in a cardiology setting using custom-made testing devices, (iii) to investigate the cost-effectiveness of IXSI in cardiology through targeted hardware modifications, and (iv) to develop a business case to support the use of IXSI in cardiac interventions. The expected outcome of the project is the acceleration of clinical implementation of IXSI in cardiac interventions, leveraging its ability to determine culprit vessels during procedures and evaluate treatment outcomes.\n\nThe commercial potential of IXSI in the interventional cardiology market is high due to the massive field of application and the large volume of annual procedures. Through this project, IXSI could significantly improve the precision and efficacy of cardiac interventions, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Hybrid Imaging in the Catheterization Room,\" aims to extend the application of the patented IXSI c-arm scanner, hitherto used for oncological purposes, into the realm of interventional cardiology. Building on the foundation established by the ERC Consolidator Grant (ERC CoG), this project seeks funding through the ERC Proof of Concept grant to evaluate the potential of IXSI in improving the identification of culprit vessels and assessing treatment outcomes during cardiac interventions.\n\nThe objectives of the project are fourfold: firstly, to assess the benefits and market share of IXSI for cardiology patient groups and treatments; secondly, to evaluate its performance specifically for cardiology using custom-made testing devices; thirdly, to investigate the cost-effectiveness of IXSI for cardiology following necessary hardware modifications; and finally, to develop a comprehensive business case promoting the adoption of IXSI in cardiac interventions.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include accelerated clinical implementation of IXSI in cardiac interventions, which will benefit from the technology's ability to provide enhanced imaging during procedures. With nearly one million percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed annually in the United States alone, the commercial potential for IXSI is substantial. This initiative promises not only to improve patient care but also to capture a significant share of the market, given its massive application field.\n\nThe project aligns with the ERC's mission to bridge the gap between pioneering research and marketable innovation, representing a strategic advancement in medical imaging technology with a high commercial incentive and the potential for significant impact on clinical practices in interventional cardiology."

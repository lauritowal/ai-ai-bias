        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Ancient Adhesives - A window on prehistoric technological complexity,\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of cognitive evolution by establishing the first reliable method to quantify the technological complexity of adhesives used by Neandertals and early modern humans. Adhesives are recognized as one of the oldest examples of complex technology, crucial for tool-making and indicative of advanced cognitive abilities. Despite their significance, the archaeological field lacks a standardized methodology to assess the complexity of these ancient technologies, which has impeded the rigorous comparison of Neandertal and modern human cognitive capacities.\n\nThe project will address this gap by achieving three main objectives: collating comprehensive knowledge on adhesives through a multidisciplinary approach involving ethnography, archaeology, and the analysis of material properties; developing an innovative archaeological methodology grounded in industrial process modeling; and evaluating adhesive technological complexity through explicit complexity measures, including preservation and production processes.\n\nExpected outcomes of the project include a reliable metric to measure technological complexity, the identification of unique behavioral patterns, and insights into the adoption and loss of complex technological knowledge over time. The research will have a profound impact on the field, enabling a step-change in debates surrounding the evolution of behavioral complexity and drawing critical distinctions and similarities between the technological proficiencies of Neandertals and modern humans. This study not only promises to illuminate aspects of our shared past but also to contribute significantly to the broader discourse on the development of human intelligence and culture.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Ancient Adhesives - A window on prehistoric technological complexity\" aims to illuminate the cognitive capacities of Neandertals and modern humans through the lens of technological sophistication, specifically focusing on the use of adhesives—acknowledged as one of the oldest examples of complex technology. The study confronts a pivotal problem in Palaeolithic archaeology: the challenge of inferring cognitively complex behavior from ancient artifacts. Current methodologies lack a consensus on how to measure technological complexity, which hampers our understanding of the evolution of cognitive capacities and behavioral complexity.\n\nThis project proposes to establish the first reliable method for comparing the complexity of adhesive technologies utilized by Neandertals and modern humans. The multifaceted approach includes collating a comprehensive body of knowledge on ancient adhesives through ethnographic study, archaeological evidence, and analysis of material properties. This foundation will facilitate the development of new archaeological methodologies, incorporating industrial process modeling to assess technological complexity.\n\nThe project's objectives are to evaluate adhesive technological complexity with explicit measures of preservation and production, through time and across species. Expected outcomes include the ability to quantitatively measure technological complexity, identify unique behaviors specific to each hominin group, and track the adoption and loss of complex technological know-how throughout prehistory.\n\nThe impact of this research will be a step-change in our debates about the development of behavioral complexity, providing new insights into the differences and similarities between Neanderthals and modern humans, and challenging existing paradigms in cognitive archaeology. The project promises to redefine our understanding of technological evolution and its implications for the cognitive capabilities of our ancestors.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Ancient Adhesives - A window on prehistoric technological complexity\n\nUnderstanding cognitively complex behavior in our prehistoric ancestors is essential for deciphering human evolution. The proposed project aims to explore this complexity by examining one of the oldest known examples of sophisticated technology: adhesives. These substances, found earlier in Neandertal contexts than in those associated with modern humans, provide a unique lens through which to compare the technological capabilities of these two species. However, the absence of a universally accepted method for measuring technological complexity in archaeological findings has been a significant barrier to progress in this field.\n\nThe project, \"Ancient Adhesives - A window on prehistoric technological complexity,\" seeks to overcome this challenge by establishing the first reliable methodology for comparing the complexity of Neandertal and modern human technologies. The project's objectives include collating extensive knowledge on adhesives from ethnographic, archaeological, and material property perspectives; developing a novel archaeological methodology leveraging industrial process modeling; and evaluating adhesive technological complexity through explicit complexity measures, such as preservation and production analysis.\n\nThe expected outcomes encompass quantitatively measuring technological complexity, identifying species-specific behaviors, and tracking the adoption and loss of complex technological know-how throughout time. The project's impact will be transformative, offering a step-change in the debates about the development of behavioral complexity and the cognitive differences or similarities between Neanderthals and modern humans. By providing a robust comparative framework, this research will significantly enhance our understanding of the cognitive and technological capabilities of our closest evolutionary relatives.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Ancient Adhesives - A window on prehistoric technological complexity\" aims to address a significant gap in our understanding of cognitive evolution: the ability to infer cognitively complex behavior in the deep past from archaeological finds. The focus is on the use of adhesives—a reflection of behavioural and cognitive complexity in Neandertals and modern humans—considered to be among the oldest examples of sophisticated technology. This project endeavors to create the first reliable method for comparing the technological complexity of adhesives used by Neandertals and modern humans.\n\nDespite the importance of technological artifacts in demonstrating cognitive capacities, there is currently no agreed-upon method to measure their complexity. The proposed research will integrate ethnographic records, archaeological evidence, experimental analyses of material properties, and industrial process modelling to develop a novel archaeological methodology. The main objectives include collating comprehensive knowledge on ancient adhesives, developing a new methodology to evaluate their complexity, and applying explicit measures of complexity to assess technological evolution through time and across species.\n\nExpected outcomes are threefold: to establish a measure of technological complexity, to identify unique behavioral traits, and to track the development and disappearance of complex technological skills. The impact of this research is profound, promising to revolutionize our understanding of behavioural complexity and the cognitive distinctions and similarities between Neanderthal and modern human species. Through this innovative approach, the project will provide a significant step-change in debates regarding the evolution of human cognition and technological capability."

Current methods to measure speech understanding involve playing specially crafted sentences to the person, letting the person repeat them, and scoring the result manually. This requires active participation of the person, specialised speech material, and is labour intensive. We present a system to measure speech understanding fully automatically. We record brain responses while the person listens to a recording of natural speech, and apply signal processing to derive speech intelligibility. The person does not need to actively participate, which enables testing of a large variety of populations that cannot be tested with traditional methods, such as young children and people with mental impairment. The measurement result relates to everyday communication skills. Our system will make diagnostics cheaper and enable diagnostics outside a specialized clinical center because the system can operate fully automatically. In this project we will seek collaboration with the industry to develop this system into a commercial product. In order to build a strong business case, we will develop a portable prototype using commodity hardware, validate it with test subjects, and conduct a market study, while strengthening our intellectual property position. Throughout the project we will actively approach potential industry partners to set up collaboration."

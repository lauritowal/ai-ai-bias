        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Ultimate Fracture Toughness through Thickness Engineering,\" aims to revolutionize fail-safe design across multiple fields including aeronautics, biomedical devices, nuclear reactors, and pipelines by pioneering innovative strategies to enhance fracture resistance in metallic structural components. Recognizing that fracture toughness is a critical material property known to vary with plate thickness, this project seeks to define the undefined magnitude of peak fracture toughness and identify the corresponding optimum thickness for maximum resistance to cracking.\n\nDespite extensive research since the 1960s, the precise relationship between fracture toughness and plate thickness, particularly within the range of a fraction of a millimeter to ten millimeters, remains a significant knowledge gap. Addressing this gap, the project vision focuses on leveraging thickness selection and control, including the development of ultra-tough metal laminates, without resorting to changes in chemistry or the invention of new microstructures. By integrating high strain hardening capacity into these materials, the project anticipates achieving unprecedented levels of cracking resistance.\n\nThe research will entail acquiring new experimental fracture data, conducting advanced 3D finite element simulations, enhancing micromechanical models, and extending materials selection approaches. It also includes the processing and assembling of novel metal laminates and conceptualizing a new laminate pressure vessel.\n\nExpected outcomes include a weight reduction by up to a factor of five and structural optimization in applications ranging from thin-walled to thick laminates, which are pivotal for fail-safe designs. Through this project, we propose to deliver a strategy that leverages the untapped potential of optimizing plate thickness to achieve ultimate fracture toughness, thereby providing a robust, lightweight, and cost-effective solution for critical applications across diverse industries.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Ultimate Fracture Toughness Through Thickness Engineering,\" aims to revolutionize the safety and efficiency of structures within aeronautics, biomedical devices, nuclear systems, and pipeline construction by enhancing the fracture toughness – a material’s resistance to crack propagation – of metallic components. Fracture mechanics have long indicated a correlation between the fracture toughness of a material and its plate thickness; however, the peak fracture toughness values and the corresponding optimum thickness dimensions have remained undefined since the 1960s.\n\nThe project's vision is to close this knowledge gap by establishing the relationship between plate thickness and fracture toughness, specifically targeting a peak value thickness range of 0.1 to 10 millimeters. Through strategic thickness selection and control, this research plans to enhance fracture resistance without altering the material's chemistry or inventing new microstructures—focusing on applications that require thin-walled constructions and thick laminates. \n\nOur approach involves conducting new experimental fracture data collection, employing 3D finite element simulations, improving micromechanical models, extending materials selection approaches, processing and assembling ultra-tough metal laminates, and developing a new concept for laminate pressure vessels. These strategies will be employed to achieve unprecedented levels of fracture resistance, particularly in high strain-hardening capacity materials, thus enabling unattained cracking resistance in critical structural components.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include significant weight reductions in structural components, potentially up to a factor of five, resulting in structural optimization that can lead to cost savings and increased safety. These improvements will be realized while maintaining the same material chemistry and microstructures, ensuring compatibility with existing manufacturing processes.\n\nOverall, the proposed research promises to set a new standard for fail-safe design in various industries by leveraging the untapped potential of fracture toughness through thickness engineering, thereby ensuring enhanced performance and reliability of critical structures.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Ultimate Fracture Toughness through Thickness Engineering\" seeks to revolutionize the structural integrity and safety of materials used across critical fields such as aeronautics, biomedical, nuclear, and pipeline industries. By focusing on the relationship between fracture toughness and plate thickness, this interdisciplinary research aims to address the existing gap in the fail-safe design criteria of metallic components. Despite knowledge accumulation since the 60s, the peak fracture toughness value and the corresponding optimum thickness for maximal fracture resistance remain undefined. \n\nOur team proposes a groundbreaking approach that does not rely on altering the chemical composition or inventing new microstructures but instead, concentrates on the strategic selection and control of plate thickness. This method targets both thin-walled applications and thick laminates, emphasizing high strain hardening capacity to resist cracking. The research will encompass new experimental fracture data collection, 3D finite element simulations, and enhancements to micromechanical models. Additionally, we will extend the materials selection approach and develop processing techniques for ultra-tough metal laminates, culminating in the creation of a new concept laminate pressure vessel.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this proposal are manifold, with a primary focus on achieving up to a fivefold weight reduction in structural designs without compromising fracture toughness. This will be accomplished by optimizing the thickness of plates based on our experimental and simulation findings. The successful completion of this project holds the promise of setting a new standard for fracture resistance in material design, leading to safer, lighter, and more efficient structures. Our vision is to enhance the fail-safe performance of critical components, ensuring peak fracture toughness is attained through meticulous thickness engineering.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Ultimate Fracture Toughness Through Thickness Engineering\" aims to revolutionize the structural integrity of materials used across critical industries—such as aeronautics, biomedical, nuclear, and pipeline—by enhancing their fracture resistance capabilities. Despite ongoing research since the 1960s, the magnitude of peak fracture toughness and the corresponding optimum plate thickness in metallic materials remain undefined. This initiative seeks to fill this knowledge gap by systematically investigating the dependence of fracture toughness on plate thickness, ranging from a fraction of a millimeter to ten millimeters.\n\nOur multidisciplinary approach focuses on creating fail-safe designs without altering material chemistry or inventing new microstructures. Instead, we will employ strategies including the selection and control of plate thickness, especially in the context of thin-walled applications and thick laminates.

These efforts are anticipated to lead to significant weight reduction in structural components by a factor of up to five, while simultaneously optimizing the structural design.\n\nAs a result, we expect to establish a novel paradigm in fracture mechanics that will not only contribute to the theoretical understanding of fracture toughness but also provide tangible benefits to the associated fields through improved material performance. The anticipated outcomes of this project have the potential to set a new industry standard for manufacturing safer, lighter, and more reliable components, ultimately contributing to economic savings and enhanced safety regulations."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Repair of Junctional Atrioventricular Conduction and Impulse Formation\n\nBackground: The current generation of biological pacemakers effectively serves approximately 20% of patients, leaving a significant portion reliant on traditional hardware pacemakers, which come with a risk of complications. There is a pressing need to expand the benefits of biological pacing to a broader patient population.\n\nObjective: The proposed project aims to develop a novel stem cell-based therapy to restore impulse formation and conduction at the atrium-ventricle (AV) interface, thereby targeting repair of AV conduction for the majority of pacemaker patients.\n\nApproach: Our multidisciplinary team will utilize human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate AV nodal cell-like cells. These cells will undergo rigorous in vitro testing to ensure functionality and safety. Subsequent in vivo implantation will be performed in sheep models with permanent AV block to assess the cells' ability to form AV bypass tracts, bridge electrical activity, and prevent ventricular response to atrial tachycardia. Collaborating with industry leader Medtronic, we will also develop specialized implantation catheters and optimize cellular constructs to meet regulatory standards for clinical testing.\n\nImpact: If successful, this therapy has the potential to significantly broaden the application area of biological pacing, encompassing nearly all pacemaker patients. This could lead to a substantial reduction in pacemaker-related complications, an improvement in quality of life for patients, and a decrease in healthcare costs. With an estimated 300,000 pacemaker implantations annually in Europe and a complication rate of 5%, our therapy could save the European healthcare system up to 8 billion Euros.\n\nThe proposed research represents a transformative step forward in cardiac care, offering a promising solution to the limitations and risks associated with current pacemaker technology.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Repair of Junctional Atrioventricular Conduction and Impulse Formation\n\nThe project aims to revolutionize cardiac care by developing a stem cell-based therapy to restore the atrioventricular (AV) conduction and impulse formation in patients requiring pacemakers. Despite advances in biological pacemakers, currently, only an estimated 20% of pacemaker patients benefit from these developments due to hardware-related complications. Our goal is to extend the innovation to cover the entire spectrum of pacemaker patients by repairing AV conduction, leveraging the potential of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).\n\nOur multi-faceted approach involves the differentiation of hiPSCs into AV nodal cell-like cells followed by rigorous in vitro testing. We plan to implant these cells with biomaterials to form functional AV bypass tracts in sheep models with permanent AV block. The effectiveness of this technique will be assessed by its ability to bridge electrical activity between the atrium and ventricle and to protect against atrial tachycardia. In collaboration with Medtronic, we will also develop dedicated implantation catheters and optimize cellular constructs to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and readiness for clinical testing.\n\nThe success of this therapy has the potential to significantly broaden the application of biological pacing solutions, potentially benefitting virtually all pacemaker patients. Moreover, this could lead to a substantial reduction in pacemaker-related complications, improve the quality of life for cardiac patients, and result in cost savings for healthcare systems. With an annual projection of 300,000 pacemaker implantations in Europe and an associated cost of â‚¬8 billion, coupled with a serious complication rate of 5%, the implications for patient care and economic relief are profound. This project, therefore, represents a critical step forward in cardiac therapeutic innovation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Repair of Junctional Atrioventricular Conduction and Impulse Formation\" project aims to address the limitations of current biological pacemaker technologies, which are applicable to only approximately 20% of pacemaker patients. The goal is to develop a stem cell-based therapy capable of restoring atrioventricular (AV) impulse formation and conduction, thus broadening the therapeutic scope to benefit nearly all patients requiring pacemakers. \n\nThe project will utilize human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate AV nodal cell-like cells, which will be tested in vitro for their functionality. Subsequently, these cells will be implanted in conjunction with biomaterials to form functional AV bypass tracts in sheep models with permanent AV block. The primary objectives include testing the ability of these cellular constructs to bridge electrical activity between the atrium and ventricle and to provide protection against atrial tachycardia. Through collaboration with Medtronic, the project will also focus on the development of dedicated implantation catheters and the optimization of cellular constructs to meet regulatory requirements for clinical testing readiness.\n\nThe impact of this innovative therapy could be substantial, potentially benefiting the 300,000 patients who receive pacemaker implantations annually in Europe alone. By reducing the prevalence of pacemaker-related complications, which currently stand at a significant 5%, the project could improve the quality of life for patients and reduce healthcare costs, which currently reach up to 8 billion Euros annually. The proposed therapy represents a transformative advancement in biological pacing, offering a solution that could supplant traditional hardware-based pacemakers and usher in a new era of cardiac treatment.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Repair of Junctional Atrioventricular Conduction and Impulse Formation,\" aims to address the limitations of current biological pacemakers by developing a stem cell-based therapy capable of restoring atrioventricular (AV) conduction and impulse formation. With approximately 300,000 pacemaker implantations annually in Europe and a complication rate of 5%, resulting in costs upward of 8 billion Euros, there is a critical need for innovative solutions. Current biological pacemakers serve only about 20% of patients due to hardware-related complications, indicating a significant unmet need for the majority of patients with pacemaker indications.\n\nThe core objective of this project is to create a therapy that leverages human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate AV nodal cells capable of restoring intrinsic cardiac rhythm. This novel approach involves extensive in vitro testing of hiPSC-derived AV nodal cell-like cells, followed by in vivo implantation in sheep models with permanent AV block. The study will assess the cells' capacity to bridge electrical activity between the atrium and ventricle, and protect against atrial tachycardia.\n\nIn collaboration with Medtronic, dedicated implantation catheters will be developed to facilitate the precise delivery of these cellular constructs. The project will also focus on optimizing the cellular constructs to meet regulatory compliance and prepare them for clinical testing.\n\nThe impact of this therapy could be profound, potentially broadening the applicability of biological pacing to nearly all pacemaker patients. This would not only reduce the incidence of pacemaker-related complications but also improve the quality of life for affected individuals and decrease healthcare expenditures. Our innovative strategy embodies a transformative step towards personalized cardiac therapy and a future of safer, more effective pacemaker alternatives."

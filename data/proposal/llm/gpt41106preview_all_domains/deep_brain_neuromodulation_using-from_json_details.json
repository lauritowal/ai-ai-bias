        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Deep Brain Neuromodulation using Temporal Interference Magnetic Stimulation\" (TIMS), addresses the critical need for improved treatments for debilitating neurological diseases such as stroke, depression, and dementia. Current therapeutic interventions are hampered by their limited spatial resolution, specificity, and inability to effectively reach deep brain areas. Our project aims to develop a proof-of-concept for a non-invasive neuromodulation tool that overcomes these limitations by employing temporal interference effects. This innovative technology uses high carrier frequency magnetic fields emitted by a pair of coils, modulating their relative phase to induce locally amplitude-modulated electric fields within the brain. This approach leverages the neural tissue's insensitivity to unmodulated high-frequency fields and its responsiveness to low-frequency amplitude-modulated fields, enabling precise modulation of neural activity with millimeter and millisecond accuracy across both superficial and deep brain regions.\n\nOur research goals include demonstrating the cell-type specificity of TIMS and establishing the feasibility of millisecond precision targeting. The anticipated device will offer high spatial resolution, depth selectivity, steerability, and closed-loop compatibility, enhancing its potential for clinical application. The project is supported by collaborations with two industry partners and one technology transfer partner, ensuring a direct pathway for the translation of research findings into innovative products.\n\nWith the successful development and proof-of-concept validation of TIMS, our project promises to revolutionize the field of brain stimulation therapies, offering a powerful new modality for treating a range of neurological conditions with unprecedented precision and efficacy.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Deep Brain Neuromodulation using Temporal Interference Magnetic Stimulation\n\nThe proposed research project endeavors to pioneer a cutting-edge non-invasive neuromodulation tool that targets precise brain areas affected by debilitating conditions such as stroke, depression, and dementia. Current treatments for these diseases are hindered by limitations in spatial resolution, specificity, and the ability to reach deep brain structures. Our project aims to overcome these challenges by developing a proof-of-concept for Temporal Interference Magnetic Stimulation (TIMS), a technology that promises millimeter- and millisecond-level precision in modulating neural activity across both superficial and deep brain regions.\n\nThe core technology of TIMS leverages temporal interference effects and utilizes a pair of coils generating high carrier frequency magnetic fields. By modulating the relative phase of these coils, we can induce a locally amplitude-modulated electric field within the brain, which is capable of altering neural activity. This technology exploits the neural tissue's insensitivity to unmodulated high-frequency fields (>1kHz) while responding to low-frequency amplitude-modulated fields, thus enabling selective and precise stimulation.\n\nOur research goals are two-fold: to prove the cell-type specificity of TIMS and to demonstrate the feasibility of targeting with millisecond precision. The anticipated device will incorporate features such as high spatial resolution, depth selectivity, steerability, and closed-loop compatibility, ensuring it can be tailored to individual patient needs.\n\nCollaboration with two industry partners and one technology transfer partner will facilitate the rapid translation of our research findings into innovative products. By addressing the critical limitations of existing treatments, this project has the potential to revolutionize the therapeutic landscape for brain-related diseases, significantly impacting patient care and quality of life.\n\n(Word Count: 271)",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Deep Brain Neuromodulation using Temporal Interference Magnetic Stimulation\" project aims to revolutionize the treatment of debilitating neurological conditions such as stroke, depression, and dementia. Current therapeutic interventions for these diseases are limited by their spatial resolution, specificity, and ability to reach deep brain areas non-invasively. Our proposal sets forth an ambitious plan to develop a proof-of-concept device that leverages temporal interference (TI) effects to modulate neural activity with unprecedented millimeter and millisecond precision.\n\nThe cornerstone of this technology is the use of high carrier frequency magnetic fields, delivered through a pair of coils, to induce a locally amplitude-modulated electric field within the brain. By modulating the relative phase of the coils, we can target specific brain regions, including deep brain structures, without affecting surrounding tissues. This is possible due to neural tissue's insensitivity to unmodulated high-frequency fields (>1kHz) and its responsiveness to low-frequency amplitude-modulated fields.\n\nOur research goals are to demonstrate the cell-type specificity of Temporal Interference Magnetic Stimulation (TIMS) and to prove the feasibility of millisecond-precision targeting. The device will boast high spatial resolution, depth selectivity, steerability, and closed-loop compatibility, making it a highly versatile tool for brain modulation.\n\nCollaboration with two industry partners and one technology transfer partner ensures that our research will quickly translate into innovative products, offering new hope for millions of patients suffering from neurological disorders. This project not only has the potential to provide a groundbreaking therapeutic tool but also to significantly advance our understanding of brain function and neuromodulation.\n\nKeywords: Temporal Interference, Neuromodulation, Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, Neural Activity, Brain Disorders, Precision Medicine.",

These processes are highly dependent on the use of membrane filtration technology. Efficient operation of these membranes is hampered by biofouling which is typically managed by chemical treatment. Amongst end-users in the water treatment sector, there is a market-pull towards more green/sustainable chemicals and this, combined with the limited effectiveness of existing biofouling control products, has created the substantial commercial opportunity described in this proposal. The unique idea in this Proof of Concept is to use natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) as a non-toxic and tuneable solution for biofouling mitigation. Preliminary data from the PI’s ERC grant, ABSOLUTE, has demonstrated that novel NADES formulations an effective, safe, scalable and economically viable solution for biofouling mitigation. The project deliverables include: (i) A composition for a NADES-based biofouling control product that exceeds the performance of the closest competing product and is superior in terms of reduced toxicity and higher biodegradability. (ii) A patent filing and a scalable commercialisation strategy. (iii) Data that confirms the cost benefits of the NADES composition in key industrial sectors. (iv) Demonstration data in to obtain feedback from end-users, partners and potential investors. These deliverables will advance the technology towards rapid commercialisation via a university spin-out company."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"Food Circuits: Hidden Connections between Migrants and Societies\" aims to unveil the intricate web of relationships woven by the movement of food from production to consumption. This project spotlights three key commodities—German asparagus, Spanish oranges, and Californian strawberries—to explore the often-invisible labor of migrant farm labourers and supply chain workers who are integral to food systems.\n\nDespite being essential to the functioning of food circuits, these laborers are frequently dismissed as disposable and face prohibitive working conditions. Simultaneously, supply chain workers, increasingly composed of migrants, operate under stringent deadlines, reflecting a challenging global logistics landscape. Meanwhile, consumers engage with these food products in a multitude of ways, seeking survival, enjoyment, identity, and ethical alignment in their dietary choices.\n\nThe project's goals are threefold: first, to develop a theory elucidating the connections between migrants and broader societies through the lens of food circuits; second, to reconceptualize the invisibility of indirect connections that bind consumers to these migrants through complex supply chains; and third, to expand research methods, emphasizing collaborative approaches and ethical considerations in fieldwork.\n\nThrough a comprehensive investigation of embodied experiences, labor practices, transportation mechanisms, and consumption patterns, this research promises to offer a transformative perspective on how food serves as a medium for social relationships and cultural incorporation. By highlighting the essential yet often disregarded contributions of migrants in the food supply chain, the project seeks to foster a deeper understanding of the socio-economic dynamics at play and encourages a reevaluation of the value ascribed to this critical workforce.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Food Circuits\" aspires to shift the narrative, bringing to light the hidden connections and fostering greater appreciation and respect for the individuals who sustain our food systems.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Food Circuits: Hidden Connections between Migrants and Societies\" project seeks to illuminate the intricate and often unseen relationships between migrant laborers, global food supply chains, and consumer societies. Through a critical examination of the production, transportation, and consumption of asparagus from Germany, oranges from Spain, and strawberries from California, this research will explore the embodied experiences of those involved in food circuits.\n\nThe core of the project lies in three interrelated objectives: (1) developing a comprehensive theory that elucidates the connections between migrants and receiving societies as mediated by food systems; (2) reconceptualizing the invisibility of these connections by highlighting the indirect ways through which food infrastructures and processes act as conduits for social relations; and (3) expanding research methods by employing collaborative techniques that emphasize ethics in field research.\n\nThis study will focus on the roles and experiences of migrant farm laborers who are often perceived as essential yet disposable, and sometimes face prohibitions in their work. It will also consider the increasing presence of migrants as supply chain workers who operate under severe time constraints, and the complex intentions of consumers who engage with food for survival, enjoyment, identity formation, and as an expression of ethical values. \n\nBy bringing to the fore the labor of producing and transporting food, alongside the process of consuming and incorporating it into daily life, the project aims to develop a new perspective on how societies are interconnected through the very act of sustenance. Through the examination of these food circuits, the project will offer insights into the lives and challenges of those who remain largely invisible in global food systems, while also shedding light on the broader socio-economic and cultural dimensions of food consumption in contemporary societies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Food Circuits: Hidden Connections between Migrants and Societies\" project seeks to illuminate the obscured yet integral relationships that exist between migrant laborers, supply chain workers, and consumers within the food industry. This project focuses on the production, transportation, and consumption of three specific food items: asparagus from Germany, oranges from Spain, and strawberries from California. \n\nThe study will examine the embodied experiences of individuals within these food circuits, particularly migrant farm laborers who are often viewed as essential yet disposable, and sometimes prohibited. It will also scrutinize the roles of supply chain workers who are increasingly migrants facing tight delivery time constraints. Furthermore, the project will explore the various intentions of consumers, which range from survival and enjoyment to identity formation and ethical considerations.\n\nOur objectives include developing a theory that uncovers the connections between migrants and societies, re-conceptualizing the invisibilization of these indirect connections through food infrastructures and processes, and expanding collaborative methods and ethics in field research.\n\nThe research will contribute to a new way of understanding the social and embodied connections between migrants and the broader society, emphasizing the role of food as a medium of interaction. By bringing to light the hidden links in food circuits, this project aims to foster a greater appreciation of the labor and intricacies involved in food production and distribution, as well as promote a more ethical and informed consumption culture.\n\nThis grant proposal represents an interdisciplinary approach that merges social theory, ethnography, and food studies, with the potential to significantly impact both academic research and societal perceptions of food systems and migrant labor.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project 'Food Circuits: Hidden Connections between Migrants and Societies' aims to illuminate the intricate, often invisible socio-economic relationships that are established through the global movement and consumption of food. By focusing on three specific food items—German asparagus, Spanish oranges, and Californian strawberries—the proposal seeks to shed light on the embodied experiences of migrant farm labourers, supply chain workers, and consumers that are deeply intertwined within the food circuits.\n\nThis multifaceted study will delve into the labour involved in producing and transporting food, as well as the process of consumption and how food is incorporated into individual and collective identities. Migrant labourers, who are indispensable yet often deemed disposable and at times prohibited, and supply chain workers, increasingly migrants themselves under tight delivery constraints, represent a human landscape behind the foods we eat. Consumers, on the other hand, engage with these foods for survival, enjoyment, identity, and ethical considerations, revealing a complex set of intentions that go beyond mere sustenance.\n\nThe project has three core objectives: to develop a theoretical framework capturing the connections between migrants and societies; to reconceptualize the invisibilization of these indirect connections through food infrastructures and processes; and to expand research methods and ethics in field research through collaborative approaches. It offers a novel perspective on the social and embodied connections between migrants and societies, challenging conventional narratives and uncovering the layers of human involvement from farm to table.\n\nThe expected contributions of this research are significant, as it will not only enhance theoretical understandings but also inform policy-making and social awareness regarding the critical roles that migrants play in our daily sustenance. The project promises to transform the way we perceive and value the labor and lives that sustain the global food system."

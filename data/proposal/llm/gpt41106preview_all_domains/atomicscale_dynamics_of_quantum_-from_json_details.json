        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Atomic-Scale Dynamics of Quantum Materials\" proposal presents a cutting-edge research initiative in the field of condensed matter physics, specifically targeting phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance in quantum materials. This project will pioneer the resolution of microscopic dynamics in the presence of atomic-scale heterogeneity, exploring the complexity across multiple length and timescales, including both static and dynamic inhomogeneities.\n\nUtilizing a suite of sophisticated techniques, including ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy at terahertz (THz) wavelengths and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with enhanced THz radiation, the project aims to achieve atomic spatial resolution and picosecond time resolution. These capabilities will allow for the control of charge order locally through tip interaction, atom manipulation, and coherent driving with THz fields. The research focuses on atomically-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy to quantify nanometer-sized variations in quasiparticle lifetimes and to understand the microscopic mechanism of charge density wave capture at singular pinning sites.\n\nThe specific goals of the project include resolving how cooper pairing is modified locally when charge order competes with superconductivity and creating new experiments to interact with many-body phases at the intrinsic length scale of charge correlation. By achieving these objectives, the project expects to identify opportunities for scaling electronic devices using quantum materials, thereby impacting areas such as correlated-electron materials and potentially leading to a new generation of devices with improved information handling and enhanced energy harvesting.\n\nThe dasQ proposal is poised to advance our understanding of quantum materials and catalyze technological breakthroughs, aligning with the broader goals of enhancing materials science and supporting the development of innovative electronic applications.",

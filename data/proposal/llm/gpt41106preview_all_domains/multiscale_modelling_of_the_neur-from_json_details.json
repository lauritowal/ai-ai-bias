        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Multiscale Modelling of the Neuromuscular System for Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation\n\nThe proposed project seeks to revolutionize the management of Parkinson's disease (PD) through the development and implementation of a sophisticated multiscale model for closed-loop Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). The current standard of care for PD involves open-loop DBS, which, while beneficial, is limited by its one-size-fits-all approach, leading to suboptimal outcomes such as side-effects, limited battery life, and often significant costs. The research objectives are to improve long-term stimulation outcomes, limit side-effects, extend battery life, increase therapeutic efficacy, reduce costs, and minimize energy consumption.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will develop a multiscale model capable of simulating the intricate interactions between neural sensing and stimulation, the electric field around the electrode, and the resulting effects on individual neurons, neural networks, and the generation of muscle force. The model will integrate phenomena across multiple temporal and spatial scales, offering unprecedented insights into the dynamic, nonlinear nature of the neuromuscular system in PD.\n\nKey components of the research include conducting rigorous validation experiments to ensure the model's accuracy and using it to identify new biomarkers of neural activity. These efforts will culminate in the design of a new control strategy for closed-loop DBS systems that can dynamically adjust to the individual patient's needs. The expected outcomes include a deeper understanding of PD and the mechanisms of DBS, leading to innovative therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes.\n\nThe anticipated impact of this research is significant, with the potential to change the way implanted devices use electrical stimulation, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals with PD. By addressing key questions that currently limit clinical implementation, this research represents a critical step forward in the field of neurotherapeutic technology.\n\nKeywords: Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation, multiscale modeling, closed-loop system, neuromuscular system, patient outcomes, therapeutic efficacy.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Multiscale Modelling of the Neuromuscular System for Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation\n\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is a transformative therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), currently operated in an open-loop system with limitations in efficacy and side effects. The proposed project aims to revolutionize DBS by developing a novel multiscale model to facilitate the transition to closed-loop DBS, which is responsive to patient-specific neural signals. This approach is designed to improve long-term stimulation outcomes, limit side effects, extend battery life, increase therapeutic efficacy, and reduce costs and energy consumption for PD patients.\n\nThe core of the research involves constructing a multiscale model that simulates neural sensing and stimulation, the electric field around the electrode, and its effects on individual neurons, neural networks, and the generation of muscle force. The model integrates data across multiple temporal and spatial scales, which allows for an advanced understanding of the neuromuscular system's dynamics. This comprehensive simulation will be rigorously validated through a series of experiments aimed at identifying new biomarkers of neural activity, which are crucial for the closed-loop system's functionality.\n\nExpected outcomes include the design of a new control strategy for closed-loop DBS, accommodating the nonlinear nature of the system and managing both short- and long-term changes in system behavior. The resulting insights into the mechanisms of PD and DBS will lead to a paradigm shift in how implanted devices use electrical stimulation, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes significantly.\n\nThis research is poised to address the critical barriers to clinical implementation of closed-loop DBS by providing a deep understanding of the neuromuscular system through innovative multiscale modeling. The success of this project promises to change the landscape of PD therapy, offering a more efficient, effective, and patient-centered approach to managing this challenging condition.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Multiscale Modeling of the Neuromuscular System for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation\n\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a transformative therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), traditionally operated in an open-loop manner without responsive adaptation to fluctuating patient needs. The proposed project, \"Multiscale Modeling of the Neuromuscular System for Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,\" aims to revolutionize DBS by transitioning to a closed-loop system that dynamically adjusts to real-time neural signals, potentially improving long-term efficacy, reducing side effects, and extending battery life—all of which could significantly reduce costs and energy consumption.\n\nTo achieve this, we will develop a novel multiscale model that simulates neural sensing and stimulation, captures the effects of the electric field around the electrode, models the impact on individual neurons and neural networks, and predicts the generation of muscle force. Importantly, our model will integrate data across multiple temporal and spatial scales to accurately reflect the complex dynamics of the neuromuscular system.\n\nThe research will conduct rigorous validation experiments to confirm the model's predictive power. Outcomes of this work include identifying new biomarkers of neural activity, which are critical for the real-time adjustments required in a closed-loop system. We will also design a new control strategy for DBS that caters to the nonlinear nature of the system and accounts for both short- and long-term changes in system behavior.\n\nAnticipated impacts of this project are profound, with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in PD. By advancing our understanding of the disease and the mechanisms by which DBS exerts its effects, we aim to change the way implanted devices use electrical stimulation. Ultimately, this research will forge a path toward clinically viable closed-loop DBS, providing patients with a more adaptive, efficient, and personalized therapy.\n\nKeywords: Closed-loop deep brain stimulation, Parkinson's disease, multiscale modeling, neuromuscular system, biomarkers, patient outcomes.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Understanding DSB repair from pathway choice to long-term effects and their consequences,\" seeks to elucidate the intricacies of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and how the epigenetic landscape influences pathway selection, the restoration process, and the enduring repercussions of DNA damage. Our objectives are to investigate the relationship between epigenetic modifications and repair pathway choice, to map the dynamic repair process using modified DSB repair sensors, to study the re-establishment of the epigenetic landscape post-repair, and to examine the potential long-lasting epigenetic alterations, or 'epigenetic scars,' that can affect cell function.\n\nWe will employ innovative methods involving homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways, with high-throughput mapping techniques to provide an unbiased timeline of the DSB repair process. Our approach enables extensive monitoring over extended periods post-repair, allowing us to observe the long-term effects of DNA damage.\n\nThis research is pivotal for deepening our understanding of ageing and age-related diseases, particularly in the context of neurodegeneration and reprogramming efficiency for induced pluripotent stem cells (IPCs). By examining animal models of neurodegeneration and the efficiency of IPC reprogramming, we aim to apply our findings to real-world scenarios, potentially leading to novel therapeutic strategies for combating diseases associated with ageing.\n\nOur comprehensive study promises to provide groundbreaking insights into the molecular mechanisms of DSB repair, offering significant advancements in the fields of genetics, epigenetics, and cellular biology.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"Understanding DSB repair from pathway choice to long-term effects and their consequences,\" aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between DNA damage repair mechanisms and the epigenetic changes that occur as a result of this process. This proposal focuses on the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, which is critical for maintaining genomic integrity. The research will delve into how the epigenetic landscape influences the choice of repair pathways, namely homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and the subsequent restoration of the epigenetic landscape.\n\nOur objectives include the investigation of the epigenetic landscape's impact on repair pathway selection, the mapping of the dynamic repair and restoration processes, and the examination of potential long-lasting epigenetic alterations, referred to as 'epigenetic scars', following repair. We propose to employ modified DSB repair sensors for high-throughput mapping of the repair timeline, leveraging both HR and NHEJ pathways. Our methods are designed to provide an unbiased view of the repair process over an extended post-repair period.\n\nOur study is pertinent to understanding the aging process and age-related diseases that are often precipitated by accumulated DNA damage. We will test our hypotheses using animal models of neurodegeneration and assess the efficiency of reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (IPCs), which is highly relevant for regenerative medicine.\n\nThis research will offer valuable insights into the preservation of DNA integrity, the cell's response to genomic insults, and the broader implications of repair mechanisms on cellular aging and disease pathogenesis.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Understanding DSB repair from pathway choice to long-term effects and their consequences,\" aims to elucidate the complex mechanisms of double-strand break (DSB) repair in DNA and the subsequent restoration of the epigenetic landscape. Focused on the intricate relationship between DNA integrity and cell function, the project will investigate how the chromatin context affects the choice between homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining repair pathways, the dynamic processes of repair and epigenetic restoration, and the long-lasting impacts of DNA damage, referred to as ‘epigenetic scars’.\n\nThe methodology integrates the use of modified DSB repair sensors to map the repair process with high throughput and unbiased precision. The repair timeline of each sensor will be extensively monitored to provide insights into the extended effects post-repair. This innovative approach allows for an in-depth analysis of the influence of the epigenetic landscape on repair pathway choice and the evaluation of long-term cellular consequences.\n\nThe significance of this research lies in its potential to advance our understanding of aging and age-related diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. By assessing the efficiency of reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (IPCs) and examining animal models of neurodegeneration, the project will shed light on the fundamental processes that maintain genomic stability and how their failure leads to disease.\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal is poised to make significant contributions to the fields of molecular biology and genetics, with implications for therapeutic strategies targeting age-associated pathologies driven by DNA damage.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Understanding DSB Repair from Pathway Choice to Long-Term Effects and Their Consequences\n\nThe integrity of DNA is paramount for cellular function and organismal health. This grant proposal outlines a comprehensive study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of double-strand break (DSB) repair, the restoration of the epigenetic landscape thereafter, and the long-term effects of DNA damage. The project will focus on the influence of the epigenetic landscape on the choice between the two major DSB repair pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). By utilizing modified DSB repair sensors, this research seeks to map the repair process in high throughput and with an unbiased timeline, extending the analysis to cover prolonged periods post-repair.\n\nThe objectives are to (1) investigate how the chromatin context affects pathway choice during DNA damage repair, (2) study the dynamic process of DNA repair and subsequent restoration of the epigenetic landscape, and (3) examine the potential long-lasting effects or 'epigenetic scars' that may contribute to ageing and age-related diseases. These goals will be achieved through innovative methods that include mapping sensor repair timelines and conducting investigations over extended periods post-repair.\n\nThe importance of this research lies in its applications to understanding ageing processes and the etiology of age-related diseases, particularly through the contexts of animal models of neurodegeneration and the efficiency of reprogramming to induce pluripotent stem cells (IPCs). The anticipated outcomes of this study will provide significant insights into DNA safekeeping, the maintenance of cellular function, and the prevention of deleterious long-term consequences of DNA damage."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Rehabilitation and Diagnosis of Hearing Loss based on Electric Acoustic Interaction (READIHEAR)\n\nHearing loss is an increasingly prevalent issue affecting individuals at all stages of life, from new-borns to the elderly, leading to detrimental social and health outcomes such as isolation, frustration, and communication disorders. The READIHEAR project aims to address this challenge by developing a groundbreaking approach for the diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss through the investigation of the interaction mechanisms between electric and acoustic stimulation across the auditory pathway.\n\nThe target populations for this innovative project include the elderly, new-borns, and the general population suffering from hearing loss. The proposed solution encompasses the creation of a new generation of diagnostic devices and a novel auditory prosthetic with minimally invasive electrodes. These advancements are expected to significantly improve speech perception, provide objective diagnostics for cochlear implantation, and facilitate the monitoring and preservation of hearing during implantation procedures.\n\nThe project's intervention methods include the use of cochlear implants (CIs) and electric acoustic stimulation. By focusing on the intricate interaction mechanisms between electric and acoustic stimulation, READIHEAR intends to uncover a deeper understanding of the variability in benefits amongst subjects, some of whom may not currently benefit from existing treatments.\n\nExpected outcomes of the project include the development of innovative diagnostic devices tailored for children and the elderly, as well as the introduction of minimally invasive treatments for age-related hearing loss. The project's nature is groundbreaking, with a research focus that spans from the cochlea to the auditory cortex. Ultimately, READIHEAR aims to deliver large-scale benefits to a broad demographic affected by hearing loss, enhancing their quality of life and social integration.\n\nKeywords: hearing loss, cochlear implants, electric acoustic stimulation, auditory prosthetic, diagnostics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: READIHEAR: Rehabilitation and Diagnosis of Hearing Loss based on Electric Acoustic Interaction\n\nHearing loss is a pervasive issue that significantly affects the quality of life, from newborns to the elderly, leading to problems such as loneliness, isolation, and communication disorders. The proposed project, READIHEAR, aims to tackle this prevalent problem by developing innovative diagnostic and rehabilitative technologies for those suffering from hearing loss. By focusing on the interaction mechanisms between electric and acoustic stimulation across the auditory pathway, the project promises to offer substantial advancements in the treatment and diagnosis of hearing impairment.\n\nThe project's core objectives include the creation of objective diagnostics for assessing low-frequency hearing, the preservation of hearing during cochlear implantation, and a deeper understanding of the benefits and variability of outcomes from electric acoustic stimulation. The targeted innovations consist of a new generation of diagnostic devices that utilize minimally invasive electric acoustic stimulation techniques and a novel auditory prosthetic that leverages the synergistic effects of this interaction for improved speech perception.\n\nThe READIHEAR project is ground-breaking in nature, aiming to produce new diagnostic tools for hearing loss, enhance hearing diagnostics for children, and offer minimally invasive treatments for age-related hearing loss. The beneficiaries of these advancements will be the vast population experiencing hearing loss across the lifespan, with particular emphasis on the elderly and newborns who are most at risk for the associated social and health complications.\n\nBy achieving these goals, READIHEAR will mitigate the detrimental impacts of hearing loss, such as impaired exchange of information and the emotional consequences of reduced social interaction. The project stands to make significant contributions to the field of audiology and the lives of individuals afflicted with hearing loss.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Rehabilitation and Diagnosis of Hearing Loss based on Electric Acoustic Interaction (READIHEAR)\n\nHearing loss is a debilitating condition affecting individuals across the lifespan, from new-borns to the elderly. Impacts include impaired communication, loneliness, isolation, dependence, frustration, and a range of communication disorders, all contributing to decreased quality of life. Current interventions, such as cochlear implants (CIs), show promise, particularly when combined with electric acoustic stimulation (EAS), but variability in patient outcomes indicates a need for improved diagnostic and treatment approaches.\n\nThe READIHEAR project aims to revolutionize the diagnosis and rehabilitation of hearing loss through the investigation of the interaction mechanisms between electric and acoustic stimulation across the auditory pathway. This ground-breaking research will focus on developing a new generation of diagnostic devices and a novel auditory prosthetic with minimally invasive electrodes. The target population includes new-borns, the elderly, and the general population suffering from hearing loss.\n\nObjectives include creating objective diagnostics for assessing low-frequency hearing, indicating cochlear implantation suitability, monitoring and preserving hearing during implantation, and understanding the mechanisms related to the benefits of EAS. By achieving these objectives, READIHEAR expects to deliver large benefits in speech perception and address the significant variability in patient outcomes currently observed.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this research are twofold: the creation of new diagnostic devices for hearing loss that combine minimally invasive electric acoustic stimulation, and the development of a novel auditory prosthetic utilizing interaction mechanisms between acoustic and electric stimulation. These innovations promise to provide improved hearing diagnostics for children and minimally invasive treatment options for age-related hearing loss, ultimately benefiting a large population suffering from this sensory deficit.\n\nREADIHEAR is poised to set a new standard in the management of hearing loss, offering significant advancements in both the understanding and treatment of this widespread condition.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: READIHEAR: Rehabilitation and Diagnosis of Hearing Loss based on Electric Acoustic Interaction\n\nHearing loss is a pervasive condition that affects individuals across all age groups, from new-borns to the elderly. It leads to profound social and psychological impacts such as loneliness, isolation, dependence, frustration, and communication disorders. The READIHEAR project addresses this global health challenge by developing innovative diagnostic and treatment modalities through the investigation of interaction mechanisms between electric and acoustic stimulation across the auditory pathway.\n\nThe project proposes a two-fold approach: (1) to create a new generation of diagnostic devices capable of providing objective diagnostics for assessing low-frequency hearing, and (2) to develop a novel auditory prosthetic that leverages minimally invasive electric acoustic stimulation. To achieve this, we will employ cochlear implants (CIs) and study the variability in outcomes among subjects, particularly focusing on those retaining some low-frequency residual hearing.\n\nOne of the central aims of READIHEAR is to improve speech perception among the target population, which includes the elderly, new-borns, and the general population with hearing loss. We anticipate that our work will lead to significant advancements in monitoring and preserving hearing during cochlear implantation and a deeper understanding of the benefits derived from electric acoustic stimulation.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project are multifaceted, ranging from the development of state-of-the-art diagnostic tools to novel, less invasive treatment options for age-related hearing loss. The beneficiaries of this ground-breaking research will be the large and diverse group of individuals suffering from hearing loss, ultimately improving their quality of life and societal participation. Our research will provide a foundation for future innovations in the field of audiology and pave the way for improved global hearing health.\n\n(Word count: 250)"

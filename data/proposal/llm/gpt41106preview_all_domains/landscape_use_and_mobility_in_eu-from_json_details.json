        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Landscape Use and Mobility In EuRopE - Bridging the gap between cremation and inhumation\" aims to advance our understanding of human mobility and landscape use in Europe from the Neolithic to the Early Medieval Period by overcoming the challenges associated with the bioarchaeological analysis of cremated remains. Due to the high-temperature processes of cremation, up to 1000°C, critical information is often lost, leaving a gap in the historical context between cremation and inhumation practices. This gap is further exacerbated by the differing biogeochemical signatures of burned and unburned remains and the lack of adequate baselines for contextualization and interpretation.\n\nTo address these issues, the project sets out to develop new proxies for calcined bone, which is subjected to temperatures above 650°C, and to re-evaluate the potential of charred bone for revealing bioarchaeological information. By creating appropriate baselines for analysis, the project expects to significantly increase the quantity and quality of data retrieved from cremated remains. This will allow the inclusion of a larger number of individuals in studies, particularly those previously disregarded due to the state of their remains.\n\nEmploying state-of-the-art biogeochemical studies on bone and teeth, along with the characterization of turnover rates for different skeletal elements, the project will utilize advanced statistical and spatial models to integrate both new and previously published data. The outcomes are anticipated to provide a more comprehensive documentation of human mobility and landscape use across various scales—local, regional, and European—during the specified study periods. By enhancing the bioarchaeological record through these innovative methodologies, the project seeks to reshape our understanding of past societies, their funerary practices, and their movements across the European landscape.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project \"Landscape Use and Mobility In EuRopE - Bridging the gap between cremation and inhumation\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of past human movement and landscape use from the Neolithic to the Early Medieval Period through the innovative analysis of both cremated and inhumed remains. The project confronts major challenges in bioarchaeology, including the loss of information due to the destructive nature of high-temperature cremation (up to 1000°C), and the contrasting biogeochemical signals derived from burned versus unburned bones. Current baselines for interpreting these remains are limited, hindering comprehensive historical reconstructions.\n\nCentral objectives of this research include the development of novel proxies for calcined bones, which are burned above 650°C, the re-evaluation of the potential of charred bones, and the establishment of adequate baselines for analysis. By increasing the quantity and quality of data retrievable from cremated remains, the project expects to expand the range of analyzed individuals to encompass those with charred remains, thereby offering a more inclusive picture of past populations.\n\nEmploying state-of-the-art biogeochemical studies on bone and teeth, alongside the characterization of turnover rates for different skeletal elements, this project will leverage advanced statistical and spatial models to synthesize new data with previously published results. The project will span across local, regional, and European scales, considering both cremation and inhumation practices to document a more complete spectrum of funerary behaviors.\n\nAnticipated outcomes include a significant enhancement in the documentation of human mobility patterns, the augmentation of the number of individuals who can be analyzed bioarchaeologically, and a better understanding of the turnover rates of skeletal elements. The project's cross-temporal and multi-scalar approach promises to deliver a transformative perspective on the interplay between funerary practices and mobility across European landscapes.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Landscape Use and Mobility In EuRopE\" (LUMIERE) project aims to bridge the historical knowledge gap between cremation and inhumation practices by focusing on the characterization of human mobility in Europe from the Neolithic to the Early Medieval Period. This innovative research confronts the challenges of information loss due to the high temperatures of cremation (up to 1000°C), the varied bioarchaeological data from burned and unburned remains, and the lack of sufficient baselines for contextualization and interpretation of these funerary practices.\n\nThe primary objectives of LUMIERE include the development of novel proxies for analyzing calcined bones, which are typically altered at temperatures above 650°C, the re-evaluation of the potential for information retrieval from charred bones, and the establishment of adequate baselines that can guide the analysis of bioarchaeological remains. The outcomes of the project are anticipated to significantly increase the quantity and quality of information gleaned from cremated remains, expand the number of analyzed individuals to encompass those with charred bones, and enhance the documentation of human mobility during the specified periods.\n\nTo achieve these goals, LUMIERE will employ advanced biogeochemical studies on bone and teeth, investigate the turnover rates of different skeletal elements, and utilize state-of-the-art statistical and spatial models. The project will integrate data across local, regional, and European scales, combining newly obtained results with previously published data. By doing so, LUMIERE will offer a more comprehensive understanding of landscape use, mobility, and funerary practices in historical Europe, ultimately contributing to a broader perspective on past human societies and their relationship with the environment.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Landscape Use and Mobility In EuRopE - Bridging the gap between cremation and inhumation\" aims to enhance our understanding of historical human mobility in Europe by addressing the challenges posed by the loss of information from the practice of cremation, which reaches temperatures up to 1000°C. The primary goal is to develop innovative proxies for analyzing calcined bone, which is created at temperatures above 650°C, and to re-evaluate the potential of charred bone remains. By creating robust baselines for analysis, this project will significantly increase the quantity and quality of information retrieved from cremated remains, enabling the inclusion of a larger number of individuals and improving the documentation of human mobility from the Neolithic to the Early Medieval Period.\n\nThe project will utilize state-of-the-art biogeochemical studies on bone and teeth to document past human movement and characterize turnover rates for different skeletal elements. Advanced statistical and spatial models will be employed to integrate data from local, regional, and European scales, combining new findings with previously published results. This methodology will allow for a comprehensive understanding of landscape use and mobility patterns during key historical periods where both cremation and inhumation funerary practices were prevalent.\n\nBy overcoming the challenges of information destruction during cremation and the differing bioarchaeological information from burned and unburned remains, the project will create a new paradigm for interpreting mobility in past populations. The expected outcomes include an increased number of analyzed individuals through the inclusion of charred bones and better characterization of skeletal turnover rates, providing a richer and more nuanced narrative of human history in Europe."

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Doping on Demand: precise and permanent control of the Fermi level in nanocrystal assemblies,\" aims to revolutionize the field of semiconductor technology by developing a novel method for the electronic doping of semiconductor nanocrystal (QD) assemblies and porous semiconductors. Quantum dots, known for their size-tunable electronic properties, are integral to this research due to their potential in enhancing opto-electronic applications such as LEDs, FETs, and solar cells.\n\nThe proposed method involves a series of innovative steps: introducing external dopants into the QD assemblies via electrochemical charge injection, immobilizing these dopants either by freezing the electrolyte solvent at room temperature or by chemically linking the ions to ligands on the QD surface, and further stabilizing the doped QD films through atomic layer deposition. The expected outcome is the achievement of stable doped nanocrystal assemblies with a constant and controllable Fermi level, maintained by the potential set during electrochemical charging.\n\nThe implications of this research are vast, with the goal of enabling unprecedented control over the doping level in QD films. This control is crucial for the development of advanced optoelectronic devices such as degenerately doped, low-threshold QD lasers capable of continuous wave excitation, and QD laser diodes with electrical injection of charge carriers. The project also ambitiously aims to optimize pin junction QD solar cells and develop first-time QD pn junction solar cells with precise Fermi level control.\n\nAddressing the challenge of electronic doping in quantum dots, this project holds the promise of significantly advancing the manufacturing and functionality of opto-electronic devices, thereby contributing to the evolution of energy-efficient technologies and potentially transforming the electronics industry.\n\n(Word count: 260)",
        "Abstract:\n\nProject Title: Doping on Demand: precise and permanent control of the Fermi level in nanocrystal assemblies\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to revolutionize the field of semiconductor technology by developing a novel approach to electronically dope assemblies of semiconductor nanocrystals (QDs) and porous semiconductors. Despite their immense potential in optoelectronic applications, the precise and stable doping of QDs has remained an elusive goal. Our aim is to achieve unprecedented control over the Fermi level in QD assemblies, which is critical for the advancement of a range of devices, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs), and solar cells.\n\nThe innovative method involves the introduction of external dopants in the form of electrolyte ions through electrochemical charge injection. To immobilize these ions and maintain a constant Fermi level, we will explore two strategies: freezing the electrolyte solvent at room temperature and chemically bonding the ions to ligands on the QD surface. Further stabilization will be achieved by encapsulating the doped QD films using atomic layer deposition.\n\nSuccessful implementation of this method is expected to result in stable, doped nanocrystal assemblies with controlled electronic properties. This will open the door to a variety of high-performance applications, such as degenerately doped, low-threshold QD lasers capable of continuous wave excitation, QD laser diodes with electrical injection of charge carriers, and optimized pin junction as well as first-time QD pn junction solar cells with precise Fermi level control.\n\nOur research will overcome the current limitations in electronic doping of QDs, offering a transformative approach that could significantly impact the efficiency and functionality of optoelectronic devices. The potential outcomes promise not only a deeper understanding of QD doping mechanics but also a leap forward in the practical application of QD-based technologies.",

The aim is to create a method enabling stable, precise, and permanent control over the Fermi level in these materials, addressing a fundamental challenge in the field of optoelectronics.\n\nThe proposed method involves the introduction of dopants to QD assemblies through electrochemical charge injection of external electrolyte ions. To achieve permanent doping, these ions will be immobilized either by freezing the electrolyte solvent at room temperature or by chemically linking the ions to ligands on the QD surface. To ensure the stability of the doped QD films, atomic layer deposition will be used for encapsulation.\n\nThe anticipated outcome is the formation of stable doped nanocrystal assemblies with a constant and controlled Fermi level, set during the electrochemical charging process. This control over doping levels is expected to lead to the development of optoelectronic devices with improved performance, including LEDs, FETs, and solar cells.\n\nSpecific applications of this technology are focused on the optimization of pin junction QD solar cells, the creation of low-threshold QD lasers suitable for continuous wave excitation, and the development of QD laser diodes with electrical injection of charge carriers.

Quantum dots are small semiconductor crystals whose size-tunable electronic properties make them ideal for a variety of optoelectronic applications. However, the electronic doping of QDs remains a significant challenge, which this project seeks to address.\n\nThrough an innovative approach that utilizes electrochemical charge injection to introduce external electrolyte ions and various strategies for dopant immobilization—including freezing the electrolyte solvent at room temperature and chemically linking ions to ligands on the QD surface—this project endeavors to achieve stable doped nanocrystal assemblies with a constant Fermi level. The potential during electrochemical charging will be carefully controlled to ensure the desired doping level.\n\nTo secure the stability of the doped QDs, atomic layer deposition will be employed to encapsulate the films. The anticipated outcome is a groundbreaking ability to permanently set the Fermi level in QDs, potentially leading to enhanced performance and new functionalities of optoelectronic devices such as LEDs, FETs, and solar cells. The project promises to yield unprecedented control over the doping level in QD films, optimize optoelectronic devices, and enable the development of degenerately doped, low-threshold QD lasers for continuous wave excitation, QD laser diodes with electrical charge injection, and optimized pin and first-time pn junction QD solar cells with precise Fermi level control.\n\nUltimately, the success of this project could pave the way for the next generation of optoelectronic devices and significantly impact the fields of lighting, energy harvesting, and electronic displays.\n\n(Word Count: 281)"

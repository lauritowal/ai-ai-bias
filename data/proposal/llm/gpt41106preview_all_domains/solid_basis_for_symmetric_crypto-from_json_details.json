        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Solid Basis for Symmetric Cryptography\" (SoBaSyC) project aspires to revolutionize the field of symmetric cryptography by addressing its fundamental challenges to enhance security and performance. Despite the community's standardization efforts since 1997, symmetric cryptography is plagued by issues such as cryptographic primitives being broken by known techniques and mistakes in published cryptanalysis. SoBaSyC aims to confront these recurrent problems by unifying the knowledge of attack families and optimizing cryptanalysis techniques.\n\nThe project's approach starts with a comprehensive study of cryptanalysis as the foundation for security. By employing algorithmic transformations and optimizations, SoBaSyC will create a toolbox of optimized algorithms that are resistant to all known attacks. This toolbox will not only provide easy application but also include the best-known attacks, ensuring that new cryptographic primitives can withstand extensive scrutiny. Additionally, the project will establish theoretical bounds and incorporate these properties into security proofs for symmetric constructions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of SoBaSyC include a significant increase in resistance to known attacks for new cryptographic proposals, thus boosting confidence in cryptographic functions. The project will also result in time savings for researchers and practitioners by providing a unified framework for evaluating security and performance. By delivering these outcomes, SoBaSyC will advance the field of symmetric cryptography on solid ground, creating a more secure environment for communications and data protection.\n\nIn summary, the SoBaSyC project will address the key issues of security basis, unification of knowledge, optimization of cryptanalysis, and theoretical work in symmetric cryptography. It will culminate in the construction of a robust toolbox for the cryptographic community, enhancing the security and reliability of cryptographic functions, and forging a path for future advancements in the field.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Solid Basis for Symmetric Cryptography\" (SoBaSyC) project is a comprehensive initiative designed to strengthen the foundation of symmetric cryptography, a critical field responsible for ensuring secure communications. Despite significant standardization efforts and community involvement in proposing and evaluating cryptographic constructions since 1997, symmetric cryptography faces recurrent challenges: primitives are often compromised by known techniques, and the literature is marred by cryptanalysis mistakes or suboptimality. This undermines confidence in cryptographic functions and necessitates the re-invention and renaming of attack strategies.\n\nSoBaSyC aims to address these issues and advance the field on solid ground. The project's cornerstone is cryptanalysis, which serves as the starting point for an algorithmic approach to unify knowledge on different families of attacks. Through this synthesis of intelligence, the project will optimize algorithms and establish theoretical bounds, incorporating these properties into robust security proofs. The deliverables include a toolbox of optimized algorithms, specifically tailored to defend against the best-known attacks and to facilitate easy application by practitioners.\n\nThe expected outcomes of SoBaSyC are multifaceted. First, it promises the development of new symmetric cryptographic primitives resistant to all known attacks. Second, it will provide more meaningful and realistic security arguments, thereby increasing confidence in cryptographic functions. Furthermore, the project will save time for security analysts and developers by avoiding the re-invention of attack techniques and fostering a more efficient evaluation process.\n\nThe impact of SoBaSyC will be significant: by providing a unified understanding of attack families, optimized algorithms, and rigorous security proofs, the project will enhance the overall security and performance of symmetric cryptography. In doing so, it will offer a leap forward in creating a secure and trustworthy digital environment for all users.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Solid Basis for Symmetric Cryptography (SoBaSyC)\n\nThe domain of symmetric cryptography is pivotal for secure communications across various platforms and technologies. Despite its significance, the field is beleaguered by challenges such as primitives compromised by existing attack techniques and errors in published cryptanalysis. These recurrent issues undermine the confidence in cryptographic functions and impede the advancement of the field. Since 1997, there have been numerous standardization efforts and public competitions that have welcomed community involvement in proposing and evaluating cryptographic constructions. However, the need for establishing a solid basis for symmetric cryptography remains pressing.\n\nThe proposed project, SoBaSyC, aims to address these challenges by taking a comprehensive and methodical approach to cryptanalysisâ€”the foundation upon which security is assessed. The project's goal is to unify the disparate knowledge of attack families, apply algorithmic transformations, and pursue optimizations to craft a toolbox of optimized algorithms. These tools will be equipped to resist all known attacks, thereby fostering new primitive proposals with enhanced security. Additionally, the project will establish theoretical bounds and incorporate these properties into security proofs for symmetric constructions.\n\nExpected outcomes from SoBaSyC include a significant increase in resistance to known attacks, a boost in confidence for cryptographic functions, time savings for researchers and practitioners, and the advancement of the symmetric cryptography field on solid ground. The toolbox will feature user-friendly algorithms capable of countering the best-known attacks, while the theoretical work will provide meaningful security properties and bounds.\n\nThrough SoBaSyC, the cryptographic community will gain an invaluable resource that can be continuously scrutinized to ensure ongoing security. The project is poised to resolve recurrent issues and prevent the re-invention or misnaming of attacks, ultimately leading to more reliable and trustworthy cryptographic practices. The anticipated impact is a marked increase in confidence in symmetric cryptographic functions and a significant progression of the field, built upon a robust and unified understanding of cryptanalysis.",

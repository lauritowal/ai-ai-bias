        "Abstract:\n\nThe INTERFACE project presents \"QUANTUM OPTICAL MAGNETOMETER FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS,\" an innovative venture aimed at overcoming current limitations in medical diagnostics by developing a novel optical magnetometer. This advanced device promises to match the sensitivity of superconducting magnetometers (SQUIDs) without their prohibitive costs and cryogenic cooling requirements. With the ability to operate at room and human body temperatures, this project leverages the optimization of quantum noise in light-atoms interactions, as demonstrated by the preliminary detection of action potential magnetic signals from a nerve.\n\nOur subsequent QUMAG project focuses on harnessing the magnetometer's capabilities for ophthalmology, particularly the creation of a magnetoretinograph. This small, fiber-connected chip will enable noninvasive, inexpensive, and ultrasensitive eye diagnostics. In collaboration with medical researchers and leading ophthalmologists, the magnetoretinograph aims to revolutionize the diagnosis and understanding of conditions such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and inborn blindness.\n\nGiven the high market potential for improved eye disease diagnostics, this project stands to make significant contributions to both the medical field and the well-being of patients worldwide.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"QUANTUM OPTICAL MAGNETOMETER FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS\" (QUMAG), under the INTERFACE initiative, aims to revolutionize medical diagnostics by developing a cutting-edge optical magnetometer. This novel device is designed to overcome the shortcomings of current superconducting magnetometers (SQUIDs), such as their high cost and the need for cryogenic cooling. By leveraging the sensitive detection of weak magnetic fields produced by human nerves, eyes, and brain, the QUMAG project promises to provide an ubiquitous tool for medical diagnostics.\n\nThe innovation lies in optimizing quantum noise in light-atoms interaction, enabling the magnetometer to operate at room and human body temperatures. Preliminary results have already demonstrated the ability to detect action potential magnetic signals from nerves. The focus is now on ophthalmologic applications, where the developed magnetoretinograph—a small, fiber-connected chip that can be placed in close proximity to the eye—offers noninvasive, inexpensive, and ultrasensitive diagnostics.\n\nCollaborating with medical researchers and leading ophthalmologists, the project aims to address critical needs in diagnosing diseases such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and inborn blindness. The market potential for such a device is high, given the pressing demand for more effective eye disease diagnostics. The INTERFACE project and its follow-up, QUMAG, are poised to set new standards in medical diagnostic technology, making advanced healthcare accessible and affordable.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe INTERFACE project introduces a groundbreaking QUANTUM OPTICAL MAGNETOMETER FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, addressing the critical need for a ubiquitous, cost-effective diagnostic tool capable of detecting weak magnetic fields generated by human nerves, eyes, and brain. The current reliance on expensive and cumbersome superconducting magnetometers (SQUIDs), which require cryogenic cooling, severely limits their use in medical diagnostics. Our novel optical magnetometer, developed within the QUMAG initiative, promises sensitivity on par with SQUIDs while operating at room or human body temperature, thus eliminating the need for complex cooling systems.\n\nBy harnessing the principles of quantum noise optimization in light-atoms interactions, our preliminary research has successfully demonstrated the detection of magnetic signals from nerve action potentials. This innovation paves the way for the development of the magnetoretinograph, a device characterized by its small, fiber-connected chip design that can be placed in close proximity to the eye. Noninvasive, inexpensive, and ultrasensitive, this device holds tremendous promise for revolutionizing the diagnosis and management of eye diseases such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and congenital blindness.\n\nCollaborating with medical researchers and leading ophthalmologists, the QUMAG project aims to leverage market potential by fulfilling the dire need for improved diagnostic methods in ophthalmology, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and accessibility to advanced medical technologies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe INTERFACE project introduces a groundbreaking optical magnetometer, the QUANTUM OPTICAL MAGNETOMETER FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS, poised to transform the landscape of bio- and medical diagnostics. This innovative device is designed to sensitively detect weak magnetic fields emanating from human nerves, eyes, and brain tissue, with applications extending into critical areas such as glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa, and congenital blindness. A significant drawback of the current gold standard in magnetic field detection, superconducting magnetometers (SQUIDs), is their reliance on expensive cryogenic cooling, which inhibits widespread use in medical diagnostics. The proposed optical magnetometer, developed within the INTERFACE project and advancing under the QUMAG initiative, is engineered to operate effectively at room and human body temperatures, eliminating the need for cryogenic conditions. This novel approach is based on the meticulous optimization of quantum noise in light-atom interactions, which has already demonstrated the ability to detect action potential magnetic signals from nerves. By collaborating with medical researchers and leading ophthalmologists, the project aims to culminate in the development of a magnetoretinograph—a small, fiber-connected chip designed for noninvasive, cost-effective, and ultrasensitive eye diagnostics. This technology promises significant market potential by addressing the urgent need for accessible and improved diagnostic tools for eye diseases, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes."

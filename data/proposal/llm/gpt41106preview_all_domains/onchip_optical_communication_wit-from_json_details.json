        "Abstract:\n\nAmidst the exponential growth in computational power, a significant bottleneck persists due to stagnant clock speeds and the limitations inherent in communication wiring between multiple cores in computer chips. This grant proposal, titled \"On-chip optical communication with transformation optics,\" presents a pioneering solution to circumvent these critical issues. The proposed project builds upon the foundational work of an ERC Advanced Grant project that explored transformation optics, from which a miniature prototype has already been developed.\n\nOur Proof of Concept project targets the creation of on-chip optical communication channels as an alternative to traditional wiring. These channels aim to address the trifold problem of space consumption, energy inefficiency, and excessive heat production. By leveraging the unique capabilities of transformation optics, the project aspires to match industry-standard performance, demonstrating a practical and scalable solution for the next generation of integrated circuits.\n\nThe anticipated outcome is a radical improvement in the integration and communication of multiple cores through optics, positioning the technology as a commercially viable successor to electronic wiring in chip design. This will ensure the continued relevance of Moore's Law in the evolution of computational technologies and could revolutionize the industry by significantly enhancing chip performance while reducing energy consumption and heat dissipation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"On-chip optical communication with transformation optics\" addresses the critical challenge of stagnant clock speeds in computer chips, a bottleneck exacerbated by the limitations of current communication wiring between multiple cores. With the computational power of chips increasing exponentially, and Moore's law being pushed to its limits, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions. This Proof of Concept project proposes a radical shift from traditional metal wiring to optical fibers, leveraging the advancements in transformation optics. Building upon a miniature prototype developed from a previous ERC Advanced Grant project, the proposed work aims to eliminate the space consumption, energy waste, and heat production associated with current wiring methods. The goal is to reach a performance that not only matches but potentially exceeds industry standards, thus demonstrating the commercial viability of the concept. By achieving this, the project promises to revolutionize on-chip communication, paving the way for faster, more efficient, and cooler-running computer chips, which is of paramount importance for the continued growth of the computational power in the tech industry.",

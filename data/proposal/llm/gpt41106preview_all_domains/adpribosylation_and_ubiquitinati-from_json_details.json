        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"ADPribosylation and Ubiquitination; post-translateral interplay,\" aims to dissect the intricate relationship between two critical post-translational modifications, ADPribosylation and ubiquitination, that regulate a myriad of cellular processes, including the immune response, cell cycle progression, protein degradation, DNA damage responses, and apoptosis. This research will illuminate the mechanisms by which these modifications influence cell biology and contribute to pathological states such as infectious diseases and cancers. \n\nBy studying the dynamic system of ADPribosylation of ubiquitin (Ub) and detailing the function of conjugating and deconjugating enzymes, the project seeks to uncover the molecular intricacies and cell biological networks these proteins orchestrate. A significant focus will be on understanding the biochemical scope of protein-protein interactions, particularly the role of UbADPr-isotypes and the consequences of non-studied UbADPr linkages within the cellular milieu.\n\nOur team, with expertise in protein synthesis, chemical biology, and structural biology, will develop novel chemical methodologies and create innovative substrates, activity-based probes, and assay reagents. These tools will allow us to profile the specificity and preferences of the enzymes involved, study their interactions and pathways within cells, and ultimately screen for small molecule inhibitors. This multidisciplinary approach promises to exploit key enzymes for the discovery of therapeutic interventions, paving the way for potential treatments of intractable diseases.\n\nThe outcomes of this research will significantly advance our understanding of post-translational modification interplay and its implications in disease pathogenesis. The findings may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating these modifications to treat or prevent diseases associated with aberrant ADPribosylation and ubiquitination.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, titled \"ADPribosylation and Ubiquitination; post-translational interplay,\" aims to elucidate the complex interplay between ADPribosylation and ubiquitination—two key post-translational modifications—and their collective impact on cellular processes. These modifications play a pivotal role in a variety of cellular functions, such as regulating the immune response, cell cycle progression, protein degradation, DNA damage responses, and apoptosis. Disruptions in these processes can lead to pathologies, including infectious diseases and cancers. Our research will bridge the knowledge gap regarding the dynamic ADPribosylation of ubiquitin (Ub), the molecular intricacies of (de)conjugating enzymes, and the broader cell biological networks they influence.\n\nThe project is structured around several core research goals: to study the dynamic ADPribosylation of ubiquitin, to delineate the molecular details of (de)conjugating enzymes, to explore the cellular networks affected by these post-translational modifications, and to leverage this knowledge for the discovery of small molecule inhibitors for therapeutic intervention. Our methodologies are multifaceted and innovative, encompassing the development of novel chemical techniques, the creation of new substrates, activity-based probes, assay reagents, profiling enzyme specificity, and screening for small molecule inhibitors. We will also investigate the interactions and pathways in cells to understand the biological consequences of UbADPr-isotypes and non-studied UbADPr linkages.\n\nThe team brings together a wealth of expertise in protein synthesis, chemical biology, and structural biology. Our research is poised to make significant contributions to the understanding of the biochemical scope of protein-protein interactions, the cell biological consequences of post-translational modifications, and the potential for therapeutic intervention in disease states associated with aberrant ADPribosylation and ubiquitination.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal titled \"ADPribosylation and Ubiquitination; post-translational interplay\" seeks to decipher the complex relationship between two critical post-translational modifications (PTMs), ADPribosylation and ubiquitination, which are pivotal in regulating various cellular processes. These modifications are instrumental in governing immune responses, cell cycle progression, proteasome-mediated protein degradation, DNA damage responses, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of these PTMs is linked to pathologies such as infectious diseases and cancers, thus understanding their interplay could lead to novel therapeutic interventions.\n\nThe research aims to delve into the dynamic ADPribosylation of ubiquitin (Ub), elucidate the molecular intricacies of conjugating and deconjugating enzymes, and explore the extensive cell biological networks they influence. A key component of the research will be to exploit the enzymes that govern these PTMs for the discovery of small molecule inhibitors, with the potential to serve as therapeutic agents.\n\nThe methodologies employed will include the development of novel chemical strategies, creation of innovative substrates, activity-based probes, and assay reagents to profile the specificity and preferences of the enzymes involved. Furthermore, the research will investigate the interactions and pathways in cells, and screen for small molecule inhibitors that can modulate these PTMs effectively.\n\nThe team brings together expertise in protein synthesis, chemical biology, and structural biology to tackle the challenges associated with understanding these complex biological processes. This multidisciplinary approach ensures a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between ADPribosylation and ubiquitination, offering insights into their roles in health and disease. The outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize our approach to treating diseases where these PTMs play a critical role, through targeted therapeutic interventions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: ADPribosylation and Ubiquitination; Post-Translational Interplay\n\nThe proposed project aims to elucidate the complex crosstalk between ADPribosylation and ubiquitination, key post-translational modifications that regulate vital cellular processes. This interplay is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and its dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including infectious diseases and cancers. Our research will focus on the dynamic modification of ubiquitin (Ub) with ADP-ribose (ADPr) and the molecular intricacies of the enzymes responsible for the addition and removal of these modifications.\n\nThis multifaceted study will explore the biochemical scope of protein-protein interactions involving UbADPr-isotypes and assess the cell biological consequences of these interactions. We anticipate that our findings will provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which ADPribosylation and ubiquitination affect immune response, cell cycle progression, proteasome-mediated protein degradation, DNA damage responses, and apoptosis. Furthermore, we expect to uncover the role of these modifications in the context of intracellular bacterial replication, DNA damage repair, and tumor development.\n\nTo achieve our objectives, we will develop novel chemical methodologies, create new substrates, activity-based probes, and assay reagents tailored for the unique specificity and preferences of ADPribosylation and ubiquitination enzymes. These tools will allow us to study the interactions and pathways in cells with unprecedented detail. Additionally, we will screen for small molecule inhibitors that can selectively target these enzymes, paving the way for therapeutic intervention strategies.\n\nThe research team brings together experts in protein synthesis, chemical biology, and structural biology, ensuring a comprehensive approach to tackling the proposed research goals. Through this integrated study, we aim to advance the frontiers of cell biology and contribute to the development of innovative treatments for diseases associated with aberrant ADPribosylation and ubiquitination."

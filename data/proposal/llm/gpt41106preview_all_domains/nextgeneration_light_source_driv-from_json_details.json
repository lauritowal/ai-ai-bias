        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Next-Generation Light Source: Driving plasmas to power tomorrow’s nanolithography\" (MOORELIGHT) proposes a transformative approach to enable efficient and reliable next-generation extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) at a wavelength of 13.5 nm, a critical technology for advanced semiconductor devices production. Current EUVL power sources utilize high-energy CO2-gas laser pulses interacting with molten tin microdroplets, a process that suffers from low overall efficiency and a megawatt per watt of EUV power footprint. MOORELIGHT aims to replace these gas lasers with solid-state lasers, which are anticipated to significantly reduce the power footprint and improve the sustainability of EUVL systems.\n\nThe proposal identifies two primary knowledge gaps: the optimal laser wavelength and the optimal plasma recipe for EUV generation. To address these, MOORELIGHT has set three research objectives: 1) understanding the phase changes and fragmentation of laser-impacted liquid thin tin targets by developing capabilities for laser-tailoring targets, 2) investigating how tailored targets couple to laser light with variable wavelength and spatiotemporal profiles to produce hot-and-dense plasma, and 3) advancing predictive plasma modeling to identify the atomic origins of EUV light.\n\nThe success of this project will significantly impact science and technology fields by enabling sustainable power for future EUVL technologies and supporting the European Union's ambition for technological leadership in nanotechnology. The combined outcome of the research objectives is expected to close the existing knowledge gaps and enable a leap forward in EUV source technology, fostering innovation and securing the competitiveness of EU-based semiconductor industries in the global market.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe MOORELIGHT project proposes a transformative approach to the production of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light for nanolithography, a key process in the manufacturing of advanced semiconductor devices. The current method for generating EUV light at the critical 13.5nm wavelength involves using high-energy CO2-gas laser pulses to interact with molten tin microdroplets. This process suffers from a low overall efficiency, resulting in a power footprint of a megawatt per watt of EUV power, which is unsustainable for future industry demands.\n\nMOORELIGHT aims to address this challenge by replacing the current gas laser technology with solid-state lasers, which are anticipated to significantly reduce the power footprint, thereby enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of EUV lithography (EUVL). To achieve this goal, MOORELIGHT has outlined three key research objectives: first, to understand the phase changes and fragmentation of laser-impacted liquid thin tin targets by developing capabilities for laser-tailoring such targets; second, to investigate the coupling of these tailored targets to laser light of variable wavelength and spatiotemporal profile to produce hot-and-dense plasma; and third, to advance predictive plasma modeling to find the atomic origins of the EUV light.\n\nDespite the promise of solid-state lasers, knowledge gaps exist regarding the optimal laser wavelength and the optimal plasma recipe for efficient EUV light production. This research intends to fill these gaps through a combination of experiments and modeling.\n\nThe impact of the MOORELIGHT project is expected to be significant across various fields of science and technology. By enabling sustainable power for future EUVL, this project will not only have a direct effect on the semiconductor industry but also support the European Union's ambition for technological leadership in nanotechnology. The outcomes will provide a critical foundation for the next generation of nanolithography, facilitating the progression of the EU and global industries toward more efficient and eco-friendly manufacturing processes.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe MOORELIGHT project aims to revolutionize nanolithography by developing a next-generation light source to sustainably power Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) systems, crucial for advanced semiconductor device production. Presently, EUVL relies on inefficient CO2-gas laser pulses interacting with molten tin microdroplets to generate the required 13.5nm wavelength light, resulting in a disproportionate megawatt power footprint per watt of EUV power. MOORELIGHT proposes to replace this with solid-state lasers, promising a significant reduction in power footprint and efficiency gains.\n\nDespite the clear benefits, critical knowledge gaps exist, including the optimal laser wavelength and plasma recipe for this application. Therefore, MOORELIGHT's research objectives are threefold: (1) understand the phase changes and fragmentation of laser-impacted liquid thin tin targets by developing capabilities for laser-tailoring these targets; (2) investigate the coupling of tailored targets to laser light of variable wavelength and spatiotemporal profile to produce hot-and-dense plasma, thus determining the optimal plasma recipe for efficient EUV light production; and (3) advance predictive plasma modeling by identifying the atomic origins of EUV light.\n\nThe expected impact of MOORELIGHT is substantial and multifaceted. It will significantly advance related fields of science and technology, enable sustainable power for future EUVL, and support the European Union's ambitions for technological leadership in the rapidly evolving sphere of nanotechnology. By addressing these challenges, MOORELIGHT will deliver the missing insight required to efficiently and reliably power next-generation solid-state-laser-driven EUV light sources, heralding a new era in semiconductor manufacturing and beyond.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe MOORELIGHT project, titled \"Next-Generation Light Source: Driving plasmas to power tomorrow’s nanolithography,\" addresses a critical bottleneck in the production of advanced semiconductor devices: the efficiency of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) at a 13.5nm wavelength. Current EUVL systems utilize high-energy CO2-gas laser pulses interacting with molten tin microdroplets, a process that is hampered by low overall efficiency and an impractical power footprint — requiring a megawatt of input for every watt of EUV power produced. Our proposal aims to transform this landscape by replacing gas lasers with solid-state lasers, promising a substantial reduction in power footprint and a leap toward sustainable and scalable EUVL technology.\n\nDespite the potential, knowledge gaps remain, including the optimal laser wavelength and plasma recipe for the solid-state laser-driven process. To address these, MOORELIGHT's research objectives are threefold: First, we will develop capabilities for laser-tailoring targets to understand phase changes and fragmentation of laser-impacted liquid thin tin targets (Objective 1). Second, we aim to investigate the coupling of tailored targets to laser light with variable properties, seeking to produce an optimum plasma recipe for EUV light (Objective 2). Lastly, we will advance predictive plasma modeling by identifying the atomic origins of EUV light (Objective 3).\n\nThe expected impacts of MOORELIGHT are significant and varied, spanning individual fields of science and technology and combining to empower the EU's ambitions of achieving technological leadership in nanotechnology. Specifically, MOORELIGHT will enable sustainable power for future EUVL, fostering advancements in semiconductor manufacturing and related technologies. Through this project, we seek to deliver the indispensable insight necessary to propel EUVL into a new era of efficiency and sustainability, benefiting industry and science alike."

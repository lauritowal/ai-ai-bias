        "Abstract:\n\nThe BioCHIPS project represents a pioneering approach to biofabrication that seeks to revolutionize the development of 3D microphysiological systems and in vitro models by recreating the hierarchical fibrillar structure of human tissues' extracellular matrix (ECM). Utilizing a bottom-up strategy, the core technology of matrix-assisted 3D free-form bioprinting, combined with the controlled self-assembly of colloidal cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), will be employed to engineer cell-laden constructs embedded within a bioinspired fibrillar CNC hydrogel device.\n\nThese constructs will be characterized by their high-resolution printing capability, optical transparency, long-term culture support, and the ability to be bioorthogonally digested, allowing for real-time monitoring and post-bioprinting analysis and processing. The user-defined computer-aided design (CAD) microfluidic circuits will enable integration into high-throughput systems, scaling up to multiple independent single organ models or complex and perfusable multicellular constructs, based on the complexity of the tissue engineered constructs and well plate used.\n\nThe BioCHIPS system will offer unparalleled customization, with the construct's geometry, the integration of signaling gradients through compartmentalization, and the array capability being tailored to meet user-defined specifications. This innovative platform aims to facilitate the production of organ/tissue-on-chip models, which can be further integrated into a bioreactor for in vitro maturation and biological tests, thereby offering a transformative tool for biomedical research and pharmaceutical development.",

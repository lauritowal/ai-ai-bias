        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Are marine living microorganisms influencing clouds?\n\nUnderstanding the complex interactions between oceans and the atmosphere is crucial for predicting weather patterns and climate change responses. About 70% of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, which contribute to regulating its temperature through the emission of gases and particles. This proposal investigates a groundbreaking area of research: the influence of marine living microorganisms on cloud properties. These microorganisms can emit various gases and particles based on environmental conditions, which may lead to nucleation of low-volatility gas-phase compounds—a process crucial for aerosol formation and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) production.\n\nRecent findings suggest that biologically driven nucleation, resulting from seawater emissions, plays a significant role in cloud formation. Marine aerosols are primarily generated via bubble bursting, and living microorganisms within these aerosols act as excellent ice nuclei, potentially impacting cloud precipitation capabilities. The main goal of this proposal is to investigate how marine emissions from living microorganisms influence CCN, IN, and ultimately, cloud properties. To achieve this, we plan to conduct a series of field experiments in the Southern Hemisphere using mesocosms that enclose the air-sea interface. This will allow us to link marine emissions to the biogeochemical properties of natural seawater and quantify marine primary bioaerosol emissions. Concurrent ambient aerosol measurements at low and high-altitude sites will be performed to evaluate the impact on the CCN population and cloud precipitation capabilities.\n\nA modeling study will merge these process studies and ambient measurements to assess the role of biologically driven marine emissions on cloud properties. This comprehensive approach will provide invaluable data to resolve the debate surrounding nucleation processes over oceans and contribute to the understanding of Earth's climate system, thus informing future climate models and predictions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, titled \"Are marine living microorganisms influencing clouds?\", addresses the critical question of how marine biogenic emissions from living microorganisms affect the atmospheric processes leading to cloud formation. With oceans covering 70% of the Earth's surface, the temperature regulation of our planet is highly dependent on the complex interplay between the ocean and the atmosphere. Variations in climate conditions alter the emissions of different species of gases and particles from marine organisms, which contribute to the nucleation of aerosols—a key step in cloud formation. The role of these emissions in creating cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) is highly debated due to limited observational data and instrumental constraints. Recent studies suggest these processes may be biologically driven, indicating a significant gap in our understanding of marine aerosol-cloud interactions.\n\nThe primary aim of this project is to explore the impact of marine emissions from living microorganisms on CCN, IN, and cloud properties. This will be achieved through an integrated approach combining field mesocosms that simulate the air-sea interface and ambient aerosol measurements at low and high altitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. The project will quantify marine primary bioaerosol emissions and evaluate their impact on IN and cloud precipitation capabilities. A key component of the methodology will be to link marine emissions to the biogeochemical properties of natural seawater.\n\nIncorporating both field experiments and modeling studies, the project seeks to merge process studies with ambient measurements to assess the role of biologically driven marine emissions on cloud properties. By enhancing our understanding of the atmospheric implications of marine biogenic activity, this research could provide significant insights into the Earth's climate system and the influence of living microorganisms on weather patterns and climate change.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Are marine living microorganisms influencing clouds?\" addresses a groundbreaking question at the intersection of marine biology and atmospheric science. Covering 70% of Earth's surface, the oceans play a critical role in regulating global climate. Living microorganisms within the ocean emit gases and particles which may contribute to cloud formation—a process yet to be fully understood. With climate change altering environmental conditions, these emissions are hypothesized to vary, subsequently affecting cloud properties and precipitation patterns.\n\nRecent studies suggest that nucleation of low-volatility gas-phase compounds, leading to aerosol formation in the atmosphere, could be biologically driven by marine emissions. Marine aerosols, primarily generated via bubble bursting, may act as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and Ice Nuclei (IN), essential for cloud formation and precipitation. However, due to scarce observational data and instrumental limitations, the nucleation occurrence over oceans and its biological contributions remain debated.\n\nThis project aims to elucidate the influence of marine emissions from living microorganisms on CCN and IN concentration, and in turn, on cloud properties. Our main goal is to investigate the entire process chain from gas-phase emissions to nucleation, growth, and their ultimate impact on the CCN population. The research will be conducted in the Southern Hemisphere, where field mesocosms will be used to enclose the air-sea interface, linking marine emissions to the biogeochemical properties of natural seawater. Ambient aerosol measurements at low and high altitudes will complement the field experiments.\n\nA modelling study will integrate process studies with ambient measurements to assess the role of biologically driven marine emissions on cloud properties. By quantifying marine primary bioaerosol emissions and evaluating their impact on IN and cloud precipitation capabilities, this project has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of marine biota's role in Earth's atmospheric processes and climate regulation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Are Marine Living Microorganisms Influencing Clouds?\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to explore a relatively under-investigated aspect of atmospheric science: the role of marine living microorganisms in cloud formation and precipitation processes. Despite the Earth's oceans covering 70% of its surface, the extent to which biological processes in seawater contribute to aerosol formation and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) remains debated. Recent findings suggest that nucleation, a key process in aerosol formation, may be biologically driven by emissions from seawater, particularly through the nucleation of low-volatility gas-phase compounds and the production of primary particles via bubble bursting.\n\nThe main goal of this study is to investigate how marine emissions from living microorganisms influence CCN, IN, and ultimately the properties of clouds. This will be achieved through a multi-pronged approach involving field mesocosms that encapsulate the air-sea interface, linking marine emissions to the biogeochemical properties of natural seawater, and conducting ambient aerosol measurements at low and high-altitude sites across the Southern Hemisphere. The project will also incorporate modeling studies to merge process investigations with ambient measurements and assess the role of biologically driven marine emissions on cloud properties.\n\nThrough this research, we aim to quantify marine primary bioaerosol emissions and evaluate their impact on IN and cloud precipitation capabilities. Understanding the biological contributions to cloud formation is critical for improving climate models and predicting future climate scenarios. This project promises to deliver significant insights into the Earth's climate system, highlighting the interconnectedness of the ocean's biological activity with the atmosphere and climate regulation."

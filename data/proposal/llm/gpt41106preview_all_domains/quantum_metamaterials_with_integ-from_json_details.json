        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the development of innovative Quantum Metamaterials with integrated atomic-like arrays aimed at revolutionizing quantum information processing. The primary goal is to actualize quantum systems capable of entanglement generation between many qubits, addressing the pivotal need for efficient quantum operations through enhanced light-matter interaction. Our approach is to construct quantum metamaterials from quantum-emitter arrays, specifically by embedding silicon-vacancy-center arrays into a diamond chip. This bottom-up strategy is anticipated to achieve an enhanced collective response to light, enabling the coherent control of emitters' internal degrees of freedom and providing access to long-lived states for robust quantum memory.\n\nThe vision of this project is to create a scalable quantum light source that can generate large-scale atom-photon entanglement. To this end, we will develop quantum information protocols for generating many-body entangled states that are fundamental to one-way quantum computation. The proposed system promises several advantages, including high-fidelity quantum control over photonic states, the potential for operation-time speed-up through the parallelization of photon control, and seamless integration into nanophotonics.\n\nOur proposal is set to overcome current limitations in quantum information processing, such as interaction strength and loss mechanisms, by focusing on a community-driven effort to enhance light-matter interaction. The result will be a transformative quantum metamaterial platform that unites major advantages for scaling-up entanglement, paving the way for breakthroughs in quantum communication, computation, and beyond.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Helicene Diimides: A Twist in Diimide Chemistry\" seeks to revolutionize the field of chiral organic semiconductors (OSCs) by developing a new class of materials known as [n]helicene diimides ([n]HDI). These novel compounds aim to exhibit pronounced chiroptical properties, high fluorescence quantum yields, and dynamic spin-selective charge-transport mechanisms. The importance of chirality in these materials is underscored by their potential applications in advanced technologies, including spin-LEDs, 3D displays, and quantum-based optical computing.\n\nOur objectives are to synthesize and study chiral [n]HDIs that bridge the research fields of planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 3D [n]helicenes, thereby creating materials with unique optical and electronic properties. The proposed synthetic strategies include a small-molecule approach to elucidate structure-function relationships, a multi-helicene approach to control electronic energy levels and self-assembly, and a macromolecular approach to develop homochiral multifunctional materials.\n\nBy integrating concepts from these diverse research areas, we expect to achieve materials that can absorb and emit circularly polarized light and exhibit magneto-chiral anisotropy, leading to breakthroughs in spin-selective electronics. The successful development of chiral [n]HDI materials has the potential to provide a significant leap forward in the design of optoelectronic devices and could pave the way for the next generation of optical computing systems.\n\nThis research not only promises to expand the toolkit of chiral OSCs but also to deepen our understanding of the interplay between molecular chirality and electronic properties, setting a precedent for future innovations in the field of materials chemistry and electronics.",

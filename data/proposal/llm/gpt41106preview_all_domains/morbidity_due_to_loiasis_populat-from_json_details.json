        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Morbidity due to Loiasis: Population-wide Evaluation and Identification of Pathogenic Mechanisms\n\nLoiasis, a disease caused by the parasitic worm Loa loa, currently affects approximately 15 million individuals, with a hundred million more at risk in Central Africa. Despite the first description of the disease in 1770, loiasis is still perceived as benign in the medical community. Our project seeks to challenge this perception by proving that loiasis reduces life expectancy and can induce severe complications in various organs, including cardiovascular and renal systems and functional asplenia.\n\nThis population-wide evaluation will be conducted in rural areas within the endemic regions, targeting a sample size of 4900 individuals. By estimating the prevalence of loiasis-related complications, the project aims to redefine the disease as a significant health threat, requiring public health intervention and international recognition. Our methodology includes extensive morbidity evaluations, which will provide evidence for the potential inclusion of loiasis in the World Health Organization's list of Neglected Tropical Diseases.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this study will have profound potential impacts, including decreased incidence and severity of malaria and pneumonia due to improved management of asplenia, specific pneumococcal vaccination recommendations in endemic areas, and changes in the management of high Loa loa infection levels. Current practices, such as the exclusion of ivermectin treatment due to the risk of post-treatment encephalopathy, underscore the need for alternative strategies.\n\nThe ethical implications of our research will be addressed by developing strategies to manage high-infection cases, ensuring that our findings translate into improved health outcomes without compromising patient safety. Ultimately, this project will change the global understanding of loiasis, leading to better prevention, management, and control of this disease.",
        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Morbidity due to Loiasis: Population-wide Evaluation and Identification of Pathogenic Mechanisms\n\nLoiasis, caused by the filarial nematode Loa loa, has historically been perceived as a benign condition since its first description in 1770. However, recent findings suggest that it may significantly reduce life expectancy and lead to severe multiorgan complications. This project aims to redefine the understanding of loiasis by conducting a comprehensive population-wide evaluation in central Africa, where 15 million people are affected and 100 million are at risk.\n\nThe study will involve a sample size of 4,900 individuals from rural areas, assessing the prevalences of cardiovascular and renal diseases, as well as functional asplenia—conditions that have been understudied in the context of loiasis. By demonstrating the disease's impact on life expectancy and identifying its role in severe organ-specific complications, we aim to shift the current perception of loiasis from a benign issue to a significant health problem.\n\nOur expected outcomes include the recognition of loiasis as a public health problem, its inclusion in the WHO's list of Neglected Tropical Diseases, and a change in the management of high Loa loa infection levels during routine surveys and onchocerciasis elimination activities. We also foresee an impact on the incidence and severity of infections favoured by asplenia, with subsequent recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in endemic areas.\n\nThe proposal addresses the ethical implications of the current exclusion of loiasis patients from ivermectin treatment due to the risk of post-treatment encephalopathy. It emphasizes the development of strategies to manage high-infection cases ethically and effectively. The anticipated findings have the potential to influence global health policies and improve the lives of millions in endemic regions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Morbidity due to Loiasis: Population-Wide Evaluation and Identification of Pathogenic Mechanisms\n\nLoiasis, caused by the filarial worm Loa loa, currently affects an estimated 15 million people with a further 100 million at risk in Central Africa. Historically described in 1770 and perceived as a benign condition, recent discoveries suggest that Loiasis may significantly reduce life expectancy and lead to severe complications in various organs. The proposed project aims to redefine the understanding of Loiasis from a benign infection to a significant public health threat and to identify the pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to morbidity.\n\nThrough a population-wide evaluation in rural areas of Central Africa with a target sample size of 4,900 individuals, the research will investigate the disease's association with cardiovascular diseases, renal diseases, and functional asplenia. This project will estimate the prevalences of these conditions among the affected population and elucidate the impact of Loiasis on life expectancy and organ-specific complications.\n\nThe expected outcomes include evidence to support the recognition of Loiasis as a public health problem and its inclusion in the World Health Organization’s list of Neglected Tropical Diseases. This recognition could lead to a decrease in the incidence and severity of infections—particularly malaria and pneumonia—that are favored by asplenia. Furthermore, findings may inform recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in endemic areas and influence the management of high Loa loa infection levels during routine health surveys or onchocerciasis elimination campaigns.\n\nThe proposal also acknowledges the ethical implications of the research, including the need to develop strategies to manage high-infection cases, especially considering the exclusion of ivermectin treatment due to the risk of post-treatment encephalopathy. The proposed project has the potential to transform the management and prevention strategies of Loiasis, ultimately improving public health outcomes in Central Africa.",
        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Morbidity due to Loiasis: Population-Wide Evaluation and Identification of Pathogenic Mechanisms\"\n\nLoiasis, caused by the parasitic worm Loa loa, is historically perceived as a benign condition despite affecting 15 million and placing 100 million at risk in Central Africa. This project aims to overturn this perception by proving that loiasis significantly reduces life expectancy and leads to severe complications in multiple organs, including the cardiovascular and renal systems, and can cause functional asplenia.\n\nThrough a rigorous population-wide evaluation involving a sample size of 4900 in rural settings, the study will estimate the prevalences of these associated conditions. The project sets out to redefine loiasis as a harmful disease, with the ultimate goal of including it in the WHO's list of Neglected Tropical Diseases. This recognition is expected to influence the management of high Loa loa infection levels during routine health surveys and onchocerciasis elimination efforts, especially considering the exclusion of ivermectin treatment due to its associated risk of post-treatment encephalopathy.\n\nThe potential outcomes of the study include an impact on the incidence and severity of infections favored by asplenia, such as malaria and pneumonia, leading to the development of specific pneumococcal vaccination recommendations in endemic areas. Ethical implications include the development of strategies to manage high-infection cases responsibly and effectively.\n\nBy challenging the current benign perception of loiasis and providing a detailed understanding of its pathogenic mechanisms, the project holds the promise of transforming public health policies and practices, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions in endemic regions. The research endeavors to bring loiasis to the forefront of global health priorities, ensuring that affected populations receive the attention and resources they deserve."

        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal introduces \"Scalable graphene-gated transistors,\" a pioneering project designated as GR-GATE, with the objective to develop the negative quantum capacitance field effect transistor (NQCFET). The NQCFET is a novel device that operates on low power supply voltages and exhibits steep subthreshold characteristics, promising a significant advancement in energy-efficient nanoelectronics. The core innovation lies in the integration of a graphene layer within the gate of MOSFET transistors, which facilitates the induction of negative quantum capacitance (NQC) due to electron-correlation effects. This feature is designed to be compatible with existing Si device architectures such as FDSOI and TFET, thereby complementing mainstream silicon devices and offering competitive advantages against emerging steep slope switch technologies.\n\nThe GR-GATE project aims to produce prototype transistor arrays at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4, focusing on scalability to larger area wafers, achieving acceptable device yield, reducing gate lengths, and lowering gate dielectric thickness. These objectives are in line with the industry's scaling trends and technological requirements, ensuring compliance and enhancing commercial value.\n\nA comprehensive commercialization plan is in place, which includes IP protection through international patent filing, technology valorisation, manufacturability assessments, and advancement towards TRL 8-9 to ensure market readiness. Collaboration with large European technology development laboratories and industrial affiliates will play a critical role in the validation of the NQCFET technology. The ultimate goal is to establish a licence agreement with key chip manufacturers, thus enabling volume production and ensuring a fast and smooth market entry.\n\nGR-GATE represents a non-disruptive innovation with high potential for scaling and integration with mainstream technologies, positioning it as a valuable asset in the pursuit of more power-efficient electronic devices. The project's successful execution is anticipated to catalyze significant progress in the semiconductor industry and contribute to the reduction of electronic devices' energy consumption.",

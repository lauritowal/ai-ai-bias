        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Function and Production of Secondary Metabolites\" (PROSECMET), addresses critical gaps in our understanding of secondary metabolites (SMs) that have significant implications for modern therapy of various diseases. SMs produced by bacteria are known for their therapeutic potential, yet their natural functions, regulatory networks governing their production, and methods to enhance their yield remain poorly understood. \n\nThe PROSECMET project is designed to elucidate the role of SMs in the symbiotic relationship between Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria and their nematode hosts, which form an entomopathogenic complex. The project's objectives are threefold: to identify the natural functions of SMs, to understand the regulatory networks involved in their production, and to increase the number and yield of SMs produced by these bacteria. \n\nThe research will be conducted in four work packages (WPs): WP1 will focus on the identification of molecular targets of SMs in bacteria, nematodes, insects, and food competitors, utilizing synthesis of SM derivatives and chemical biology methods. WP2 aims to unravel the regulatory networks by identifying external factors that activate SM production, investigating the role of SMs as internal signals, and employing tools such as flow cytometry, promoter-reporter gene fusion, and promoter libraries. WP3 will leverage the findings of WP2 to increase the chemical diversity and yield of SMs in at least 100 different bacterial isolates, involving genome sequencing and promoter exchange techniques. Finally, WP4 will optimize SM production by coupling cell growth to SM production using regulatory elements identified in WP2 or designed artificial regulators, with the goal of systematically constructing SM overproducers.\n\nThis innovative project has the potential to revolutionize the field of SM research by providing insights into their natural roles and by developing new strategies to enhance their production, thereby contributing to the discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: PROSECMET - Function and Production of Secondary Metabolites\n\nThe project PROSECMET aims to elucidate the natural roles and regulatory networks of secondary metabolites (SMs), as well as to enhance their production in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus bacteria, which form an entomopathogenic complex with nematodes. Recognizing the significance of SMs in modern therapy for various diseases, this initiative seeks to bridge the knowledge gaps concerning their natural function, the underlying regulatory mechanisms, and strategies for increasing the number and yield of SMs.\n\nThe research is structured into four work packages (WPs). WP1 focuses on the identification of molecular targets of SMs in bacteria, nematodes, insects, and their food competitors using chemical biology methods and synthesis of SM derivatives. WP2 aims to uncover external factors activating SM production and to determine if SMs act as internal signals, utilizing flow cytometry, promoter libraries, and reporter genes. WP3 will apply the findings of WP2 to increase the chemical diversity and yield of SMs in at least 100 different bacterial isolates, supported by genome sequencing and promoter exchange techniques. Lastly, WP4 is dedicated to the optimization of SM production by coupling cell growth with SM output through the implementation of regulatory elements and the design of artificial regulators, with the ultimate goal of systematically constructing SM overproducers.\n\nBy integrating interdisciplinary approaches, such as derivatives synthesis for target identification, chemical biology, flow cytometry, and promoter-reporter gene fusion, this proposal sets out to not only deepen our understanding of SMs but also to pioneer novel methodologies for enhancing their production. The outcomes of PROSECMET have the potential to significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry, offering new avenues for drug development and therapeutic applications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, PROSECMET, aims to elucidate the function and enhance the production of bacterial secondary metabolites (SMs), which play a pivotal role in modern therapy for various diseases. Despite their importance, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding the natural functions of SMs, the regulatory networks that control their synthesis, and strategies to increase their diversity and yield. The project focuses on the entomopathogenic bacteria Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, which live in symbiosis with nematodes and have been largely unexplored for their SM potential.\n\nOur multidisciplinary approach encompasses four work packages (WPs). WP1 will identify molecular targets of SMs in bacteria, nematodes, insects, and food competitors through the synthesis of SM derivatives and chemical biology methods. WP2 aims to uncover the external factors activating SM production and to determine whether SMs serve as internal signals within the producing organisms, employing flow cytometry and other chemical biology tools. WP3 will apply the factors discovered in WP2 to increase SM variety and yield in at least 100 different bacterial isolates, utilizing genome sequencing and promoter exchange techniques. Finally, WP4 is dedicated to the optimization of SM production by coupling cell growth to SM synthesis, thereby systematically constructing SM overproducers using regulatory elements identified in WP2 or designed artificial regulators.\n\nThrough this research, PROSECMET aspires to advance our understanding of SMs' ecological roles and to develop novel methods to boost their production, thereby contributing to the discovery and manufacturing of new therapeutic agents. Our findings will not only fill existing scientific gaps but will also have the potential to revolutionize the way we harness bacterial SMs for medical applications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project PROSECMET, \"Function and Production of Secondary Metabolites,\" addresses the significant role of bacterial secondary metabolites (SMs) in modern therapy for various diseases. Despite their importance, gaps remain in our understanding of the natural function of SMs, the regulatory networks controlling their production, and strategies to increase both the number and yield of these metabolites. Utilizing the model entomopathogenic bacteria, Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, which live in symbiosis with nematodes, this proposal aims to elucidate these aspects through a comprehensive set of work packages (WPs).\n\nWP1 focuses on the identification of SM targets within bacteria, nematodes, insects, and other food competitors. This will be achieved through the synthesis of SM derivatives and the application of chemical biology techniques. WP2 aims to unravel the regulatory networks by identifying external factors that activate SM production and determining whether SMs themselves act as internal signals. Flow cytometry, along with promoter-reporter gene fusion, will be key methodologies employed.\n\nWP3 seeks to increase chemical diversity by applying the factors identified in WP2 to enhance the SM variety and yield in at least 100 different bacterial isolates. This will involve genome sequencing and promoter exchanges to facilitate SM biosynthesis. Finally, WP4 aims at the optimization of SM production by coupling cell growth with SM production, thereby systematically constructing SM overproducers using regulatory elements or designed regulators from WP2.\n\nThe expected outcomes of PROSECMET include a deeper understanding of the natural roles of SMs, elucidation of the regulatory networks involved in their production, and the development of novel methods to significantly increase the number and yield of these metabolites, thus contributing to their potential therapeutic applications. The project leverages a combination of derivatives synthesis, chemical biology methods, flow cytometry, and genomic techniques to achieve its goals."

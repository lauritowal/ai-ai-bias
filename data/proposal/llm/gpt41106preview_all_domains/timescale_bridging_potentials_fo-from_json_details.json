        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Time-scale Bridging Potentials for Realistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations\n\nThe TIME-BRIDGE project seeks to revolutionize the field of molecular dynamics simulations through the development of a novel pseudopotential ansatz. Despite the theoretical knowledge of ultra-strength materials for 80 years, the vast time-scale gap between microsecond and second time scales has remained a persistent and fundamental problem, preventing the accurate simulation of mechanical processes in these materials. The magnitude of this gap spans ten orders of magnitude, and existing approaches have failed to reconcile this discrepancy.\n\nOur project proposes an innovative approach that borrows the concept of pseudopotential from first-principles simulations to capture the fast thermal motion of atoms, thus allowing us to simulate mechanical behaviors on previously inaccessible time scales. By leveraging recent methodological advancements and significant hardware advances capable of tackling trillions of atoms, we aim to close the time-scale gap and enable simulations from microseconds to seconds. This advancement has the potential to transform the field of materials design, particularly in the creation of nanostructured designs that require a precise understanding of atomic motion.\n\nWhile the project entails high risks due to the distinct physics of electron motion which may render the pseudopotential ansatz non-transferable, the gains are equally high. Successfully bridging the time-scale gap will not only provide insights into the mechanical properties of theoretical materials but will also pave the way for designing new materials with extraordinary properties.\n\nThe principal investigator brings distinguished expertise in molecular dynamics, ensuring that the project is led by a team capable of overcoming the technical challenges. TIME-BRIDGE stands to offer a groundbreaking solution to a long-standing limitation, opening up new horizons for research and application in material science and engineering.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Time-scale bridging potentials for realistic molecular dynamics simulations\" (TIME-BRIDGE), aims to revolutionize the field of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations through the development of a novel pseudopotential ansatz. Current MD simulations are hindered by a significant time-scale gap that limits their ability to simulate mechanical processes from microseconds to seconds, a discrepancy spanning ten orders of magnitude. TIME-BRIDGE seeks to bridge this gap by capturing the fast thermal motion of atoms within an effective potential derived from first-principles simulations.\n\nDespite the 80-year theoretical knowledge of ultra-strength materials and the advances in computational hardware that now allow for the simulation of trillions of atoms, no existing approach has successfully addressed the time-scale discrepancy in MD. TIME-BRIDGE's nanostructured design and sophisticated simulation tool aim to enable applications in materials design, specifically for mechanical processes that occur over a wide range of time scales. \n\nThe proposed pseudopotential ansatz is a groundbreaking concept borrowed from first-principles simulations. It promises to capture the distinct physics of electron motion separate from atomic motion, a feature that is currently non-transferable to longer time scales but is essential for the accurate prediction of material properties.\n\nLed by a distinguished Principal Investigator with expertise in the field, TIME-BRIDGE represents a high-risk, high-gain endeavor. Recent methodological advancements have set the stage for this ambitious project, which seeks to address a fundamental problem in the simulation of materials and could have far-reaching implications for the design and understanding of new materials.\n\nThe successful development of TIME-BRIDGE has the potential to transform the molecular dynamics simulation landscape, providing an unprecedented tool for researchers and engineers to design materials with enhanced properties and performance.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Time-scale Bridging Potentials for Realistic Molecular Dynamics Simulations\" (TIME-BRIDGE), addresses a fundamental challenge that has persisted for over eight decades—the time-scale gap in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Despite the theoretical knowledge of ultra-strength materials, current simulation tools are unable to replicate mechanical processes that occur over extended time scales, from microseconds to seconds, due to a ten orders of magnitude discrepancy. TIME-BRIDGE seeks to overcome this barrier through the development of a novel pseudopotential ansatz, borrowing concepts from first-principles simulations, to capture the fast thermal motion of atoms within an effective potential framework.\n\nThe project will utilize advanced molecular dynamics simulation tools and recent hardware advancements that enable tackling systems comprising trillions of atoms. The innovative approach of nanostructured design is central to this endeavor, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of material behavior under various conditions. The pseudopotential ansatz is expected to allow for the accurate simulation of time scales previously unattainable, with applications in materials design, particularly in the context of nanostructured materials.\n\nThe project embodies a high-risk, high-gain venture. The distinct physics of electron motion, separate from atomic motion, means that the pseudopotential ansatz may not be directly transferable to other systems. Nevertheless, the potential gains in bridging the time-scale gap are substantial, promising breakthroughs in the simulation of dynamic mechanical processes.\n\nLed by a PI with distinguished expertise, the TIME-BRIDGE project is poised to make methodological advancements that will redefine the landscape of molecular dynamics simulations. The successful development of this technology would represent a quantum leap in our ability to design materials with unprecedented precision and control, laying the foundation for future innovations in a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe TIME-BRIDGE project seeks to revolutionize molecular dynamics simulations through the development of a novel pseudopotential ansatz. This groundbreaking initiative addresses the long-standing time-scale problem that has hindered simulations from reaching the microsecond to second range – a gap spanning up to ten orders of magnitude. For over 80 years, this issue has persisted in the theoretical domain, with existing methods failing to bridge the vast discrepancy between the fast thermal motions of atoms and the prolonged mechanical processes of interest in materials design.\n\nLeveraging recent methodological and hardware advancements, which now make it feasible to tackle systems comprising trillions of atoms, TIME-BRIDGE will implement a nanostructured design approach grounded in first-principles simulations. The pseudopotential ansatz proposed is poised to capture the fast thermal motion of atoms within an effective potential, enabling the simulation of mechanical processes across the previously inaccessible time scales. With applications in materials design, particularly the creation of ultra-strength materials, the project holds the potential to transform our understanding and development of new materials.\n\nThe project carries both high risk and high gains, as the distinct physics of electrons and atomic motion poses a significant challenge. However, the Principal Investigator (PI) brings distinguished expertise to the table, assuring confidence in the project's success. The TIME-BRIDGE proposal is not merely an incremental step but a leap forward in computational material science, promising to deliver a transformative tool for researchers and developers in the field.\n\nThis ambitious project, while pushing the boundaries of current simulation capabilities, stands to offer a paradigm shift in our ability to predict and design material behavior at the most fundamental levels."

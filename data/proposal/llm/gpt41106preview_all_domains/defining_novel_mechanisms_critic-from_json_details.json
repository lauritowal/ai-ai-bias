        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Defining novel mechanisms critical for colorectal tumourigenesis,\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of the oncogenic processes in colorectal cancer (CRC) by focusing on the entire spectrum of genetic mutations present at the initiation of tumour formation. A paradigm shift in oncogenesis understanding is anticipated due to the impact of cancer genome sequencing, which reveals a small number of frequently mutated genes and a larger number of infrequently mutated genes. The role of these infrequently mutated genes remains unclear, and separating their function from mutational noise is a significant challenge.\n\nThe central hypothesis of this research is that genes mutated at low frequency contribute to CRC initiation and, by extension, tumour progression. The project seeks to determine the role of these genes in CRC during tumour initiation and validate and determine the function of a subset of identified genes, possibly unveiling novel cancer mechanisms. \n\nTo achieve these objectives, state-of-the-art methodologies will be employed, including whole-genome screening in a 3D organoid CRC initiation model and CRISPR genetic disruption. The project will utilize 3D mouse and human organoid cultures and advanced mouse models to verify the function and relevance of these genes in a physiological context.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are manifold. It will lay the foundation for understanding the importance of the entire spectrum of mutations in CRC, thus opening new avenues of research into the function of these genes. Furthermore, the project has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of tumourigenic mechanisms and inform the development of cancer therapeutics. This comprehensive approach promises to provide key insights into the early stages of tumourigenesis, with the overarching goal of improving patient outcomes through targeted cancer therapies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Defining Novel Mechanisms Critical for Colorectal Tumorigenesis\n\nRecent advancements in cancer genome sequencing have ushered in a paradigm shift in our understanding of oncogenesis. Colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, has been characterized by a small number of frequently mutated genes, which have become the focus of therapeutic development. However, the larger number of infrequently mutated genes presents a significant challenge due to their unclear role and difficulty in distinguishing them from mutational noise. Our project aims to define the function of all genes mutated in CRC at the earliest stages of tumor initiation, with a specific focus on those mutated at low frequency not previously described as cancer driver genes.\n\nWe hypothesize that infrequently mutated genes contribute significantly to CRC initiation, and we propose to use a comprehensive approach to validate their role. Our methodology includes a whole genome screen in a 3D organoid CRC initiation model, employing CRISPR genetic disruption techniques, as well as leveraging 3D mouse and human organoid cultures and advanced mouse models. Our research objectives are twofold: firstly, to determine the role of genes mutated in CRC during tumor initiation; and secondly, to validate and determine the function of a subset of identified genes, potentially revealing novel cancer mechanisms.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are manifold. We anticipate laying a foundation for understanding the importance of the entire spectrum of mutations in CRC, opening new avenues of research into the function of these genes, and ultimately impacting our conceptualization of tumorigenic mechanisms. Consequently, this may influence the development of cancer therapeutics, positioning our research at the forefront of innovative approaches to combat CRC.\n\nThis comprehensive approach promises to provide a critical insight into the tumorigenic process, offering hope for more effective strategies in cancer prevention and therapy.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Defining novel mechanisms critical for colorectal tumourigenesis\" seeks to revolutionize our understanding of colorectal cancer (CRC) by exploring the full spectrum of genetic alterations that occur during the initial stages of tumour development. Despite a known array of frequently mutated genes in CRC that have been targeted for therapeutic development, a vast number of infrequently mutated genes remain poorly understood, often dismissed as mere mutational noise. This research proposes that these low-frequency mutations play a critical role in tumour initiation and may reveal novel mechanisms of oncogenesis.\n\nOur team will employ a state-of-the-art whole genome screen within a 3D organoid CRC initiation model, utilizing CRISPR technology for genetic disruption, alongside advanced mouse models and 3D mouse and human organoid cultures. Through these innovative methodologies, we aim to determine the role of genes mutated in CRC at tumour initiation and validate the function of a subset of identified genes that have not been previously described as cancer driver genes.\n\nOur hypothesis posits that both frequently and infrequently mutated genes contribute significantly to CRC initiation, and thus, a comprehensive understanding of their functions is imperative. This research aspires to establish a foundational comprehension of the mutation spectrum in CRC, thereby catalyzing new avenues for research into gene functions and their contributions to oncogenic pathways.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project include a foundational understanding of the mutation spectrum in CRC, identification of new research avenues for gene functions, and a substantial impact on tumourigenic mechanisms and the future landscape of cancer therapeutics. By illuminating the roles of all mutated genes in the context of CRC, this project has the potential to shift the paradigm in oncogenesis understanding and influence the development of more effective cancer treatments.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Defining novel mechanisms critical for colorectal tumourigenesis\" aims to revolutionize our comprehension of oncogenesis by focusing on the full spectrum of genetic mutations present in colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly those occurring at the initiation stage. The advent of cancer genome sequencing has led to a paradigm shift, revealing that while a small number of genes are frequently mutated in CRC, a larger group is mutated less frequently, whose roles in tumourigenesis remain unclear. This study hypothesizes that these infrequently mutated genes contribute significantly to CRC initiation.\n\nThe primary aim is to define the function of all genes mutated in CRC at tumour initiation, with a specific focus on validating and determining the function of a subset of genes not previously described as cancer drivers, thus potentially defining novel cancer mechanisms. The methodology involves a comprehensive whole genome screen in a 3D organoid CRC initiation model, employing CRISPR genetic disruption techniques alongside advanced mouse models and 3D mouse and human organoid cultures.\n\nThe research aims to determine the role of genes mutated in CRC during tumour initiation and to validate and determine the function of identified genes for novel cancer mechanisms. These aims are underpinned by research techniques that include CRISPR genetic disruption, 3D organoid culture systems, and advanced mouse models.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the study are multifold. Firstly, it will establish a foundation for understanding the importance of the entire spectrum of mutations in CRC. Secondly, it will open new avenues of research into the function of these genes. Lastly, it will potentially impact our understanding of tumourigenic mechanisms and influence the development of cancer therapeutics.\n\nIn conclusion, this comprehensive approach will provide critical insights into the previously underappreciated role of infrequently mutated genes in CRC, setting the stage for future advances in cancer research and treatment strategies."

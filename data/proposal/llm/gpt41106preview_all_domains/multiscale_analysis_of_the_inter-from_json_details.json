        "**Abstract:**\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Multi-scale analysis of the interplay between cell morphology and cell-cell signaling,\" aims to dissect the complex relationship between cell shape, intercellular communication, and genetic regulatory frameworks that orchestrate tissue development. Central to this inquiry is the Notch signaling pathway, a conserved mechanism integral to the patterning and differentiation processes in the mammalian inner ear.\n\nOur objectives are to: 1) understand how cell morphology influences and is influenced by signaling dynamics and genetic regulatory circuits; 2) analyze the dependence of intercellular signaling on cell morphology, particularly focusing on cell boundary attributes; and 3) integrate our insights into signaling and genetic networks with cellular morphology to elucidate robust differentiation patterns characteristic of the cochlear architecture.\n\nEmploying a combination of quantitative in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, complemented by advanced mathematical modeling, we will investigate the Notch signaling pathway and its mediated patterning effects. Cutting-edge techniques, such as novel reporter designs, micropatterning technology, and high-resolution cochlear inner ear explant imaging, will be utilized to probe the intricacies of cellular interactions. A novel hybrid modeling approach will further enable us to simulate and predict the integration of signaling pathways with morphogenetic processes.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a systemic understanding of the developmental processes that connect cell morphology with regulatory circuits, insights into how cell boundary geometry and molecular composition affect signaling, and the ability to track the transition from an undifferentiated state to the ordered pattern of hair and supporting cells in the cochlea.\n\nThis comprehensive multi-scale analysis will provide unprecedented detail into the mechanisms by which cells coordinate their behavior during complex tissue patterning, promising to inform both basic biological research and potential therapeutic strategies for developmental disorders and regeneration.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Multi-scale analysis of the interplay between cell morphology and cell-cell signaling,\" aims to dissect the complex interactions among cellular shape, signaling pathways, and genetic regulatory networks, with a specific focus on the Notch signaling system and its role in tissue development. The research will concentrate on the mammalian inner ear to provide insight into embryonic development and cellular differentiation processes.\n\nOur objectives are to understand how cell morphology influences intercellular signaling, how these signals integrate with genetic circuits to direct cell fate decisions, and how cell boundary properties affect signaling dynamics. To achieve these goals, we will employ a combination of quantitative in-vitro and in-vivo experiments alongside advanced mathematical modeling. Novel reporters and micropatterning technology will be utilized for precise manipulation and observation of cell behavior, while cochlear inner ear explant imaging will offer detailed visualization of cell morphology and patterning in a native context.\n\nWe hypothesize that the boundary geometry and molecular composition of cells significantly influence Notch signaling and that this relationship is critical for the establishment of the ordered pattern of hair and supporting cells observed in the cochlea. Our integrated approach will provide a systems-level understanding of how signaling pathways and cell morphology coalesce to drive the transition from an undifferentiated state to a highly ordered tissue structure.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include elucidating the boundary effects on Notch signaling, understanding the interplay between cell morphology and Notch signaling in tissue patterning, and tracking the differentiation patterns in the cochlea. These findings will have broad implications for developmental biology, with potential applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This project promises to bridge the gap between molecular, cellular, and tissue scales, enhancing our comprehension of developmental mechanisms and their implications for human health.",

The research will pivot around the Notch signaling pathway, a critical mediator of cell fate decisions, and its role in the morphological and functional patterning of the mammalian inner ear.\n\nThe central objectives are to understand how intercellular signaling is influenced by cellular morphology and the molecular composition of cell boundaries, as well as how these signals integrate with genetic circuits to drive robust differentiation patterns. We will employ a combination of quantitative in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, alongside a novel hybrid mathematical modeling approach, to analyze the Notch signaling interactions between pairs of cells and explore the effects of cell boundary geometry on signaling processes.\n\nKey techniques include the use of novel reporters for real-time tracking of signaling events, micropatterning technology to manipulate cell shape and contacts, and high-resolution explant imaging of the cochlear inner ear to visualize the transition from an undifferentiated state to the ordered arrangement of hair and supporting cells. This multi-disciplinary approach will provide a systems-level understanding of developmental processes by connecting cellular morphology with regulatory circuits.\n\nExpected outcomes of the study include insights into how the geometry and molecular composition of cell boundaries affect signaling, determination of how cell morphology and Notch signaling contribute to the robust patterning in the cochlea, and the identification of mechanisms governing the transition to a well-ordered pattern of cellular differentiation. This research will have broad implications for developmental biology, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine, offering potential strategies for the repair and restoration of tissue function in degenerative diseases.",

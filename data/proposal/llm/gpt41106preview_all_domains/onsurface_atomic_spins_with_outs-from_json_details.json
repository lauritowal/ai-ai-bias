        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"On-Surface Atomic Spins with Outstanding Quantum Coherence\" (ATOMQUANT) is designed to revolutionize quantum information processing and magnetic sensing by significantly improving the coherent properties of atomic spins on surfaces. By employing advanced techniques such as scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), electron spin resonance (ESR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and magnetic exchange force microscopy, ATOMQUANT aims to enhance phase coherence times by orders of magnitude and establish a groundbreaking AFM-based architecture for quantum computing and sensing at the atomic level.\n\nOur objective is to manipulate and measure single spin resonance within an ultra-low temperature, milliKelvin-AFM environment, addressing the challenges of detecting surface spins under such extreme conditions and integrating these systems into functional devices. We intend to utilize remote substrate nuclear spins, specifically the 25Mg isotopes in a magnesium oxide substrate, as a quantum resource, leveraging their unique properties to support our ambitious goals.\n\nThe project leverages our team's extensive background in ESR-STM to construct an atomic-scale workbench that will not only facilitate quantum research at its most fundamental limit but also enable the exploration of potential qubit systems with superior quantum coherence in-situ and atom-by-atom. Our approach promises to overcome the existing detection challenges of spins on surfaces, low-temperature requirements, and device integration hurdles, thereby unlocking new frontiers in quantum science and technology.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of ATOMQUANT include establishing new paradigms for quantum information processing and magnetic sensing technologies with unprecedented precision and reliability. This research has the potential to catalyze significant advancements in quantum computing, communication, and sensing, propelling these fields towards practical, scalable solutions for the world's most complex computational problems.",

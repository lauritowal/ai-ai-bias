        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Stable and Clean Iron Power from ICONIC\" project represents a groundbreaking initiative aimed at developing a sustainable and efficient Iron Power technology as a CO2-free circular energy carrier. This innovation addresses the critical need for stable and environmentally friendly energy storage and transport solutions in the face of increasing global energy demands and the imperative to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nIron Power technology boasts numerous advantages, including high energy density, ease of handling, safety, and low cost. However, it currently faces significant challenges such as flame stabilisation, the evaporation of iron leading to nano-particle generation, and high NOx emissions. The ICONIC solution—Ignition COntrolled low-Nox Iron Combustion—proposes a novel combustion concept to overcome these issues. By recirculating partly-cooled hot burnt gases, creating autoignition mixtures, and suppressing nano-particle and NOx formation, ICONIC aims to achieve a well-controllable burner system.\n\nThe proposal outlines a strategic development plan that includes the creation of a small-scale system, followed by the conceptual design of a Mega-Watt size burner. This phased approach ensures meticulous attention to detail and gradual scaling. The anticipated outcomes include a patent-pending ICONIC burner and a comprehensive market evaluation to explore commercial interest from startups and potential launching customers.\n\nThe proposed project not only promises a significant reduction in NOx emissions but also the potential for industrial-scale implementation of a circular energy carrier system. The successful proof of concept (PoC) will serve as a critical indicator of the project's viability and its capacity to revolutionize the energy market. Through participation in the ERC MetalFuel program, this initiative aspires to set a new standard for sustainable energy practices, paving the way for a cleaner and more stable energy future.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Stable and Clean Iron Power from ICONIC\" project aims to revolutionize the way we store and transport sustainable energy by utilizing Iron Power technology. With the dual challenges of climate change and the growing demand for energy, there is a pressing need for CO2-free and circular energy carriers. Iron Power presents an innovative solution with its high energy density, ease of handling, safety, environmental friendliness, and cost-effectiveness.\n\nDespite its potential, current Iron Power systems face technical hurdles such as flame stabilization, nano-particle evaporation, and high NOx emissions. The ICONIC (Ignition COntrolled low-Nox Iron Combustion) project proposes a novel combustion concept to overcome these issues. The approach involves recirculating partly-cooled hot burnt gases to create an autoignition mixture that stabilizes the flame and suppresses the formation of nano-particles and NOx emissions. The project entails developing a well-controllable ICONIC burner, starting with a small-scale system and progressing to a conceptual design of a Mega-Watt size system.\n\nThe process involves burning an iron aerosol mixture, collecting iron-oxide powder, and regenerating the iron powder using green hydrogen. This circular process ensures that the system remains CO2-free throughout its lifecycle. The project has already attracted commercial interest, with start-ups and potential launching customers closely monitoring its progress. The development phases are set to culminate in industrial-scale system implementation and a thorough market evaluation.\n\nWith a patent pending for the ICONIC combustion concept, the project's success will be measured by the Proof of Concept (PoC) success. The grant proposal seeks funding to support the development of ICONIC under the ERC MetalFuel program. The anticipated outcome is a sustainable and scalable Iron Power system that can meet the growing global energy demands without contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.",

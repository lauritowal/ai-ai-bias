        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Layering, Understanding, Controlling and Integrating Ferroelectric Polar Textures on Silicon\" (LUCIOLE) seeks to revolutionize the field of ferroelectric materials by focusing on the integration of topological polar textures, such as polar skyrmions and merons, onto a silicon substrate. These nanoscale ferroelectric perovskite oxides, discovered in recent years (2019 and 2020), have the potential to overcome the limitations posed by the current standard substrate, SrTiO3, and pave the way for the creation of ultra-compact memory devices with storage capacities exceeding Tbit/in2.\n\nThe objectives of LUCIOLE are threefold. Firstly, we aim to monolithically integrate topological polar textures on silicon using advanced fabrication techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy and atomic layer deposition. By employing engineering strategies such as strain, confinement, and frustration, we will create epitaxial and glass-composite nanoscale ferroelectrics directly on silicon. Secondly, we intend to meticulously understand these polar textures by deploying state-of-the-art correlative microscopies and spectroscopies, including operando time-resolved methods, to analyze the dynamic features of these emergent states. Finally, we will integrate these ferroelectric materials into the architecture of silicon chips, focusing on sub-500 nm two- and three-terminal devices. This will involve tunable stress applications and manipulation under electric fields, with a statistical screening of properties at the wafer scale to ensure reliability and consistency.\n\nLUCIOLE is poised to make significant contributions to the advancement of CMOS semiconductor technologies by bridging the gap between ferroelectric materials and silicon-based devices. This project will not only further our understanding of complex polar textures but also enable the development of cutting-edge technological applications in topological electronic devices and high-density memory storage.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Layering, Understanding, Controlling and Integrating Ferroelectric Polar Textures on Silicon\" (LUCIOLE) project represents a groundbreaking effort to advance the state of ferroelectric materials for technological applications. This project aims to address the current limitations of special oxide substrates, such as SrTiO3, by monolithically integrating topological polar textures onto a silicon platform, leveraging advanced CMOS semiconductor technologies. The project's focus is on creating, understanding, and integrating nanoscale ferroelectric perovskite oxides that exhibit unique polar textures, such as polar skyrmions and merons, which were discovered in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will utilize innovative methods including molecular beam epitaxy and atomic layer deposition, along with engineering approaches such as strain, confinement, and frustration engineering. These efforts will enable the creation of epitaxial and glass-composite nanoscale ferroelectrics with monolithically-integrated topological polar textures on silicon. Advanced correlative microscopies and spectroscopies, including operando time-resolved methods, will be used to understand the polar textures, providing insight into their nanoscale features and dynamic behaviors.\n\nIntegration of these ferroelectrics at the nanoscale within Si chips is the final objective, targeting the development of ultra-compact memories with storage capacities exceeding Tbit/in^2. The project will design sub-500 nm two-terminal and three-terminal devices, with a particular focus on tunable stress and manipulation under electric fields. Statistical screening of properties on a wafer scale will be employed to assess the behavioral patterns and ensure consistency and reliability.\n\nLUCIOLE is poised to push the boundaries of memory technology, offering a path towards ultra-high-density data storage and novel topological electronic devices that harness the unique properties of ferroelectric materials.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Layering, Understanding, Controlling and Integrating Ferroelectric Polar Textures on Silicon\n\nThe proposed project, \"Layering, Understanding, Controlling and Integrating Ferroelectric Polar Textures on Silicon\" (LUCIOLE), aims to pioneer the monolithic integration of topological polar textures, such as polar skyrmions and merons, onto silicon substrates. This endeavor is motivated by the potential of these ferroelectric materials to revolutionize the field of electronic devices, particularly ultra-compact memories, by significantly enhancing storage capacities beyond Tbit/in^2. Despite the notable discoveries of these polar textures in 2019 and 2020, their use has been limited by the reliance on special oxide substrates like SrTiO3. \n\nLUCIOLE addresses this challenge by implementing innovative techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy and atomic layer deposition to create epitaxial and glass-composite nanoscale ferroelectrics with controlled strain, confinement, and frustration engineering. The project's objectives are threefold: first, to create these topological polar textures on silicon, allowing for their integration with current Si-based CMOS semiconductor technologies; second, to develop an in-depth understanding of the polar textures through advanced operando time-resolved methods, correlative microscopies, and spectroscopies; and third, to integrate these ferroelectric materials into sub-500 nm two- and three-terminal devices at the front-end- and back-end-of-line of Si chips, with a focus on tunable stress and electric field manipulation.\n\nThe project promises to overcome current substrate limitations and establish a new platform for ferroelectric material integration, providing a fundamental leap forward in the development of topological electronic devices. Through statistical screening and property evaluation at wafer scale, LUCIOLE will not only push the limits of ferroic material exploration but also set the stage for future technological advancements in high-density data storage and efficient electronic components.",

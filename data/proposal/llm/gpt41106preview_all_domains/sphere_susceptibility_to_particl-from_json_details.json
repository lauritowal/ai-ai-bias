        "Abstract:\n\nThe SPHERE project, standing for Susceptibility to Particle Health Effects, miRNAs, and Exosomes, is a pioneering investigation into the intricate relationship between air pollution and Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) among overweight and obese individuals. This research initiative aims to unravel how exposure to airborne particulate matter and associated metals influences the modification of exosomes in human plasma and, subsequently, their impact on the risk factors and outcomes associated with CVD.\n\nThe study will recruit a population of 2000 subjects from the Center for Obesity and Weight Control in Milan, with a particular focus on a subgroup of 200 individuals for detailed personal exposure assessment using passive samplers. The exposure to pollutants will be comprehensively evaluated using ambient concentrations, geographical modeling, traffic data, and biological markers of metals in urine and hair.\n\nThe proposed research employs a two-stage, split-sample design. In the discovery stage, OpenArray miRNA expression profiling will be conducted on 1000 subjects to identify miRNAs altered by exposure to pollutants. The replication stage will focus on the real-time analysis of the top 10 miRNAs identified, further substantiating the findings.\n\nAn innovative aspect of the project is the use of in vitro models, including A549 lung cells, granulocytes, and endothelial cells, to clarify if exosomes produced by lung and granulocytes directly interact with endothelial cells, potentially elucidating a mechanism for the systemic spread of the effects of air pollution.\n\nSPHERE addresses a significant gap in the understanding of the intermediate mechanisms linking air pollution to CVD. The high consistency of epidemiological findings on the health effects of air pollution and the moderate or weak evidence on intermediate mechanisms underscore the urgency and importance of this research. By determining the role of exosomes as mediators and identifying key miRNAs involved, the project aspires to contribute critical insights into the susceptibility factors of obesity in the context of air pollution and CVD, potentially guiding future public health interventions and policies.",
        "Abstract\n\nThe SPHERE project aims to elucidate the role of exosomes as potential mediators in the relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among the overweight and obese population. Air pollution is a significant environmental risk factor implicated in CVD; however, understanding of the intermediate mechanisms remains moderate to weak. We propose to determine how exposure to particulate matter (PM) and associated metals affects the production and modification of exosomes in human plasma, and to establish the connection between these alterations and CVD risk factors and outcomes.\n\nOur study will recruit 2000 overweight/obese participants from the Center for Obesity and Weight Control in Milan, providing a unique population in which obesity may act as a susceptibility factor to the health effects of air pollution. We will use a comprehensive set of exposure assessment methods, including ambient concentrations of pollutants, geographical information systems, road density, traffic intensity data, metals determination in urine and hair, and personal passive samplers for a subgroup of 200 subjects.\n\nThis investigation will utilize a two-stage, split-sample study design. In the discovery stage, we will profile miRNA expression in 1000 subjects using OpenArray technology. The replication stage will involve real-time analysis of the top 10 miRNAs identified. Concurrently, an in vitro model using A549 lung cells, granulocytes, and endothelial cells will be employed to investigate if exosomes produced by the lung and granulocytes directly interact with endothelial cells.\n\nBy integrating epidemiological data with molecular biology techniques, SPHERE will provide critical insights into the complex interactions between environmental exposure and cardiovascular health. This research has the potential to identify novel biomarkers and pathways for intervention, ultimately contributing to the prevention and management of CVD in populations at risk due to air pollution.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: SPHERE: Susceptibility to Particle Health Effects, miRNAs and Exosomes\n\nAir pollution is a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), especially among vulnerable populations such as the overweight and obese. The proposed research project, SPHERE, intends to unveil the intermediate mechanisms by which air pollution contributes to CVD, focusing on the role of exosomes and microRNA (miRNA) alterations. This project hypothesizes that exosomes may mediate the effects of air pollution on CVD by transporting miRNAs that contribute to endothelial dysfunction and subsequent cardiovascular risk.\n\nA cohort of 2000 subjects, characterized by overweight and obese conditions, will be recruited from the Center for Obesity and Weight Control in Milan. The study will employ a two-stage, split-sample design. The discovery stage will involve OpenArray miRNA expression profiling in 1000 subjects to identify miRNAs altered by air pollution exposure. The replication stage will test the top 10 miRNAs identified in the discovery stage using real-time analysis in the remaining subjects. Exposure to air pollutants will be assessed through various methods, including ambient concentration measurements, geographic information systems, and personal passive samplers for a subgroup of 200 subjects.\n\nAdditionally, in vitro models using A549 lung cells, granulocytes, and endothelial cells will investigate the direct interaction of exosomes produced by respiratory and immune cells with endothelial cells, providing mechanistic insights into how these vesicles may contribute to CVD.\n\nThe SPHERE project aims to bridge the gap between epidemiological evidence and biological mechanisms by establishing a link between air pollution exposure, exosome and miRNA alterations, and cardiovascular health. This research will not only advance our understanding of the pathophysiological processes behind air pollution-induced CVD but also potentially identify new biomarkers for susceptibility and therapeutic targets.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe SPHERE project, standing for Susceptibility to Particle Health Effects, miRNAs and Exosomes, is a groundbreaking study designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which air pollution contributes to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), with a particular focus on the role of exosomes as mediators of this effect. Given the high consistency of epidemiological findings linking air pollution to CVD and the moderate or weak evidence for intermediate mechanisms, this study aims to fill a critical knowledge gap.\n\nOur hypothesis proposes that exposure to particulate matter (PM) and PM-associated metals influences the composition and function of exosomes in human plasma, thereby affecting CVD risk factors and outcomes. To test this, we will recruit a cohort of 2000 overweight or obese individuals from the Center for Obesity and Weight Control, Milan, acknowledging obesity as a susceptibility factor.\n\nWe will employ a range of exposure assessment methods, including the measurement of ambient pollutant concentrations, geographical information system modeling, road density, and traffic intensity data, as well as personal passive samplers in a subgroup of 200 subjects. The study design consists of a two-stage, split-sample approach; the discovery stage will involve OpenArray miRNA expression profiling in 1000 subjects, followed by a replication stage using real-time analysis of the top 10 miRNAs identified.\n\nFurthermore, we will develop an in vitro model using A549 lung cells, granulocytes, and endothelial cells to examine whether exosomes produced by lung/granulocytes can directly interact with and potentially cause dysfunction in endothelial cells.\n\nSPHERE's integrated research strategy promises to advance our understanding of the biological pathways through which air pollution influences CVD, emphasizing the role of miRNAs and exosomes. This could lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, ultimately contributing to the prevention and treatment of CVD in populations exposed to air pollution."

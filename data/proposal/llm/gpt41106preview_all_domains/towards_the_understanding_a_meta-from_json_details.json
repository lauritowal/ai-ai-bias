        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Towards the Understanding of Metal-Tumour-Metabolism,\" aims to elucidate the intricate mechanisms by which tumour cells manage essential metal ions and respond to platinum-based anticancer drugs. This research is pivotal in advancing our knowledge of metal ion metabolism in tumour development and in overcoming treatment resistance. The objectives are threefold: to explain the coping mechanisms of tumour cells with metal ions and chemotherapeutics, to reveal the biochemical and molecular relationships between metal ions and proteins during tumour progression, and to discover new carcinogenetic pathways.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the project will focus on studying the interactions of metallothioneins with essential metals and anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. The project team will employ an array of methods including optimization of electrochemical, mass spectrometric, and immune-based assays, as well as genetic modifications of target genes. These approaches will be rigorously tested using in vitro conditions and in vivo models, namely, mice with breast tumours (MCF-7 and 4T1) and MeLiM minipigs with melanomas.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project are multifold. We anticipate a precise delineation of tumour-related pathways dealing with metal ions, based on metallothionein functions, leading to new highly effective treatment strategies. The suppression of tumour growth and enhancement of current treatment effectiveness are key anticipated results. Furthermore, this study will expand our understanding of cancer formation and development, providing insights that may be critical in addressing multidrug resistance and treatment failures.\n\nIn summary, this project aspires to contribute significantly to the understanding of cancer biology, particularly in the context of metal ion metabolism, and to catalyze the development of next-generation anticancer therapies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Towards the Understanding of Metal-Tumour-Metabolism\" aims to elucidate the intricate mechanisms by which tumour cells manage essential metal ions and resist platinum-based chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. This research seeks to dissect the biochemical and molecular-biological relationships between metal ions, specifically metallothioneins, and proteins within the context of tumour development. By doing so, it intends to uncover new carcinogenetic pathways and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments.\n\nOur approach encompasses a series of robust methods including the study of metallothionein interactions with metals and anticancer drugs, both in vitro and in vivo, using advanced electrochemical, mass spectrometric, and immune-based techniques. These investigations will be complemented by genetic modifications of target genes to verify discovered pathways. The experimental models consist of mice bearing breast tumours (MCF-7 and 4T1) and MeLiM minipigs bearing melanomas, providing a comprehensive insight into tumour behaviour in living organisms.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are manifold. We anticipate providing a precise description of tumour-related pathways that deal with metal ion challenges based on metallothionein activities. In doing so, we aim to suppress tumour growth and development, improve the effectiveness of current treatments, and pave the way for the development of new, highly effective treatment strategies. Ultimately, this research will deepen our understanding of cancer formation and development, potentially leading to significant advances in cancer therapy and patient outcomes.\n\nBy addressing the complex interplay between metal ions and tumour metabolism, this project offers a promising avenue towards overcoming the limitations of existing cancer treatments and improving the prognosis for cancer patients worldwide.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Towards the Understanding of Metal-Tumour-Metabolism,\" seeks to elucidate the complex interplay between metal ions, metal-binding proteins such as metallothioneins, and tumour development. This investigation is imperative for advancing our comprehension of tumour cell metal ion metabolism and the role it plays in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.\n\nThe primary objectives are to explain how tumour cells manage essential metal ions and withstand platinum-based drugs, unravel the biochemical and molecular-biological relationships between metal ions and proteins, and discover new carcinogenetic pathways. Our approach encompasses the study of metallothionein interactions with metals and platinum-containing anticancer drugs (cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin), both in vitro and in vivo. We aim to optimize a suite of analytical methods, including electrochemical, mass spectrometric, and immune-based techniques, to closely monitor these interactions. Furthermore, we will conduct genetic modifications of target genes to validate identified pathways, with subsequent testing on established animal models: mice bearing breast tumours (MCF-7 and 4T1) and MeLiM minipigs bearing melanomas.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include a precise characterization of tumour-related pathways dealing with metal ions, a deeper understanding of cancer formation and development, and the suppression of tumour growth. With these insights, we aim to direct the development of highly effective treatment strategies that can overcome multi-drug resistance and improve patient outcomes.\n\nThis research project promises to fill crucial knowledge gaps in the field of oncology and metal metabolism, potentially leading to breakthroughs in cancer treatment. By investigating the underpinnings of metal ion handling within tumour cells, we can pave the way for novel and more efficacious therapeutic approaches.",

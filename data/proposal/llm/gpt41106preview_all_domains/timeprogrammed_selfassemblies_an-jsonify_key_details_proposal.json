The response should contain exactly one item in the 'descriptions' array!\n\n---\n\n**Title:**\n\nTime-Programmed Self-Assemblies and Dynamic Materials\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe central objective of TimeProSAMAT is to introduce concepts to precisely program the time domain of self-assemblies (SAs) in closed systems with a transient self-assembled state (lifetime) by developing non-equilibrium SA concepts with feedback mechanisms and energy dissipation, that later on allow autonomous dynamics and self-regulation behaviour on a materials level. The key experimental methodology is based on mastering the kinetics of opposing assembly/disassembly steps to drive systems out-of-equilibrium and reach transient dynamic states. TimeProSAMAT approaches this challenge by introducing: (i) a generic pH-feedback system to program lifetimes of pH-switchable SA (ii) ATP-fueled, catalytic, dissipative SAs using antagonistic enzymes (iii) active structural feedback mechanisms Our focus is on peptide and DNA-based SAs with highest control over structure formation, precisely tunable pH switching points and susceptibility to enzymatic transformations. We will study SA kinetics for increased complexity and length scales of SAs, and investigate mechanistic details of phase transition and steady-state dynamics in the transient state. We start with molecular motifs, proceed to peptide nanofibrils, DNA-based Au-NP superlattices, and hydrogels. These enabling SA concepts allow step-change advancements toward dynamic materials, spawning self-regulation and time-programmed memory functions. We want to capitalize on our understanding and provide first concepts for (i) self-erasing hydrogels for fluidic guidance in microfluidic systems and (ii) reversible shape memory actuators for soft robotics – with our long term goal to approach first applications as biomaterials. TimeProSAMAT’s approach of function by programming the time domain profoundly contrasts present SA research pursuing function by structure only. In long term, the integration of active feedback mechanisms and energy dissipation is a decisive step to reach active and adaptive soft matter."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposal \"Adolescent Precursors to Psychiatric Disorders – Learning from Analysis of User-Service Engagement\" aims to establish an evidence base for how young people interact with mental health services and support structures during adolescence, a critical developmental period. This project will address a significant gap in the current research landscape by collecting a unique dataset focusing on the UK and Brazil, which will be analyzed using both standard and innovative life course methods. \n\nAdolescence is the primary period when health risk behaviors emerge, with 70% of adult psychiatric disorders being preceded by mental health problems during these formative years. Despite this, there is often a delay of more than ten years before individuals receive care. The project will explore not only current access models to mental health services but also the individual experiences of young people, including both positive and negative interactions. It will also investigate culturally embedded social factors that impact access to mental health care.\n\nThe outcome of the project is to develop diverse and innovative strategies for earlier access to care, informed by globally relevant insights into mental health care delivery for young people. This international resource will significantly contribute to understanding the complex problem of adolescent mental health from a global perspective. Ultimately, the project seeks to influence the design of future health care services, ensuring they are better suited to the needs of young people and reducing the burden of psychiatric disorders worldwide.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Adolescent Precursors to Psychiatric Disorders – Learning from Analysis of User-Service Engagement\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the ambitious project APPLAUSE, aimed at uncovering the early interactions between adolescents experiencing mental health issues and the array of mental health services and support structures available to them. Through a comprehensive analysis of new data collected in both the UK and Brazil, the project seeks to illuminate the patterns of complete service use and identify the critical period of adolescence as a focal point for intervention.\n\nPsychiatric disorders are the primary cause of disability in the 10-24 age group, with 70% of adult psychiatric disorders having their onset in these formative years. Despite this, there exists a staggering delay of over ten years in accessing care, often due to poorly understood impediments. APPLAUSE addresses this gap by focusing on current access models, individual experiences, and culturally embedded social factors that impact access to care.\n\nThe project will utilize innovative life course methods alongside standard analysis techniques to produce a globally relevant body of evidence. The insights gleaned will contribute to the development of a diverse and innovative set of strategies aimed at facilitating earlier access to care for young people. By characterizing service use patterns and analyzing both positive and negative interactions with health care services, APPLAUSE will offer an international resource that informs future health care service design.\n\nThe anticipated outcome is a significant contribution to the understanding of mental health care delivery for young people on a global scale, overcoming cultural and social barriers, and laying the groundwork for a transformation in early intervention practices. This proposal addresses a complex problem from a global perspective and sets the stage for impactful change in the field of adolescent mental health care.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Adolescent Precursors to Psychiatric Disorders – Learning from Analysis of User-Service Engagement\n\nAdolescence represents a critical period in mental health development, with 70% of psychiatric disorders in adulthood having their onset during these formative years. However, a significant delay of over ten years often occurs before individuals receive care, suggesting a gap in early identification and intervention. The proposed project aims to address this gap by producing a comprehensive body of evidence that charts the interactions between young people with emerging mental health problems and the array of mental health services and support structures available to them.\n\nDrawing on innovative life course methods and standard analysis, this research will collect and analyze data from the UK and Brazil to characterize the complete patterns of service use during the adolescence of individuals. The project will examine current access models to mental health care, individual experiences (both positive and negative), and culturally embedded social factors that impact access to health care services. This work is crucial, as the factors impeding access to care during this critical period remain largely unknown.\n\nBy focusing on a globally relevant problem and utilizing an international resource perspective, the project aims to produce insights that will contribute to the design and delivery of mental health care services for young people worldwide. The outcome will be an important data set that does not currently exist in the field, providing a foundation for the development of diverse and innovative strategies aimed at facilitating earlier access to care for adolescents.\n\nUltimately, this project seeks to advance our understanding of how mental health problems develop and are addressed during adolescence, with the goal of improving mental health outcomes across the globe through informed, culturally sensitive, and timely interventions.",
        "Abstract:\n\nProposal Name: Adolescent Precursors to Psychiatric Disorders – Learning from Analysis of User-Service Engagement\n\nAim: This grant proposal, named Adolescent Precursors to Psychiatric Disorders – Learning from Analysis of User-Service Engagement (APPLAUSE), seeks to develop a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between young people experiencing mental health issues and the various formal and informal mental health services and support structures available to them. The primary aim is to generate evidence that can lead to the development of innovative strategies for earlier access to mental health care.\n\nMethods: The project will collect and analyze data from two distinct cultural contexts, the UK and Brazil, using both standard and innovative life course methods. This will aid in characterizing the complete patterns of service use during adolescence, a critical period for mental health development.\n\nSignificance: Psychiatric disorders are the primary cause of disability among individuals aged 10-24 years, with 70% of adult psychiatric disorders being preceded by mental health problems during adolescent years. Despite this, there is often a delay of more than ten years in accessing care, and the factors impeding access remain largely unknown. By focusing on current access models, individual experiences, and culturally embedded social factors, the project aims to address this complex global problem.\n\nImpact: The expected outcome is the creation of an important international resource offering globally relevant insights into mental health care delivery for young people. This resource will be pivotal in advancing the development of diverse and innovative strategies for improving earlier access to care, thus potentially reducing the long-term impact of psychiatric disorders worldwide.\n\nConclusion: APPLAUSE promises to fill a significant gap in the current understanding of adolescent mental health service engagement and pave the way for transformative changes in how mental health care is delivered to young people globally."

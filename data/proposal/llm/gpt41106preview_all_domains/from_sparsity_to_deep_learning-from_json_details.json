        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"from SPArsity to DEep learning,\" addresses the critical challenge of the lack of a theoretical foundation in deep learning (DL) across three major domains: computer vision, signal & image processing, and language processing. Despite the widespread success of DL, there remains a significant gap in understanding the underlying principles, particularly in the unsupervised regime and regression tasks. This proposal sets forth an ambitious plan to bridge this gap by leveraging the well-established theoretical framework of sparse representations—a data model that has proven effective in fields such as medical imaging, computer vision, and signal processing.\n\nThe project's primary objectives are to broaden the successful application of DL to new fields, enhance DL performance in underdeveloped areas, and develop a unified theoretical framework that integrates sparsity tools with DL constructs. By highlighting the role of data structure, the research aims to use DL to refine solutions for problems modeled by sparse representations, thus advancing the current state of learning methods and architectures.\n\nThe potential impact of this project is profound, promising a new generation of learning methodologies that can scale new summits in novel domains and tasks. The outcomes will not only improve existing applications in the affected fields but also pave the way for ground-breaking advancements in areas where DL has yet to make a significant mark.\n\nThis project's approach is to systematically address the fundamental theoretical deficiencies in DL by utilizing tools and concepts from the sphere of sparsity. By doing so, it promises to create a symbiotic relationship between the two areas, resulting in robust, efficient, and theoretically sound learning paradigms. The expected result is a paradigm shift in the way deep learning is understood and applied, setting the stage for transformative developments across a broad spectrum of computational sciences.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: from SPArsity to DEep learning\n\nDeep learning (DL) has revolutionized fields such as computer vision, signal & image processing, and language processing, yet it suffers from a lack of theoretical foundation, especially in the unsupervised regime and regression tasks. The proposed project, \"from SPArsity to DEep learning,\" aims to address these deficiencies by leveraging the well-established theoretical foundation of sparse representations—a related data model extensively applied in domains like medical imaging, computer vision, and signal processing. \n\nThe project's primary goal is to create a unified theoretical framework that merges the principles of sparsity with DL. By highlighting the role of structure in data and using sparsity tools, the project seeks to bridge the fundamental gap in the theory of DL. This endeavor will not only improve DL performance in its traditional domains but also broaden its success to new fields and applications, enabling a new generation of learning methods and architectures.\n\nThe project will focus on three key objectives: (1) enhance DL performance in the unsupervised regime, (2) improve DL's capability in handling regression tasks, and (3) utilize DL to refine solutions for problems modeled with sparse representations. This innovative approach is expected to bring DL to new summits by advancing learning methods in novel domains and tasks, thus having a transformative impact on the fields affected by sparse representations.\n\nIn summary, \"from SPArsity to DEep learning\" is poised to address the theoretical shortcomings of DL by integrating sparsity concepts, thereby catalyzing advancements in learning architectures and methods. The successful completion of this project will not only enrich our theoretical understanding but also unlock significant improvements in practical applications across various disciplines.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"from SPArsity to DEep learning\" seeks to address the critical lack of theoretical foundation in the field of deep learning (DL). Despite DL's remarkable success in domains such as computer vision, signal & image processing, and language processing, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood, particularly in the unsupervised regime and regression tasks. The proposed research aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the well-established theoretical framework of sparse representations, which has shown significant promise in related fields including medical imaging and computer vision.\n\nThe primary objectives of the project are to broaden the success of DL to new fields and applications, enhance its performance in the unsupervised regime, and improve its efficacy in regression tasks. By highlighting the role of structure in data and applying tools developed for sparsity, the project will develop a unified theoretical framework that merges the strengths of sparsity with DL. This approach promises to not only provide a deeper understanding of DL mechanisms and architectures but also to use DL to improve solutions for problems traditionally addressed by sparse models.\n\nThe expected impact of the project is twofold: it will lead to a new generation of learning methods and architectures, and it will propel the field of deep learning into new domains and tasks, setting new benchmarks for performance. By providing a solid theoretical foundation, the project aims to unleash the full potential of DL and ensure its robustness and adaptability across a variety of complex data-driven applications.\n\nIn summary, \"from SPArsity to DEep learning\" will systematically address the theoretical deficiencies of DL by integrating the field with the principles of sparsity. The anticipated outcome is a transformative shift in the landscape of machine learning, resulting in more powerful, generalizable, and theoretically sound learning algorithms.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"from SPArsity to DEep learning\" (SPADE) proposal addresses a critical deficiency in deep learning (DL)—the lack of a robust theoretical foundation. Despite the empirical success of DL in various applications, its theoretical underpinnings remain underexplored, especially in domains such as computer vision, signal & image processing, and language processing. SPADE proposes to bridge this gap by leveraging the well-established theoretical framework of sparse representations, a data model extensively employed in fields like medical imaging and signal processing.\n\nThe project's fundamental aim is to broaden the success of DL by improving its performance in the unsupervised regime and on regression tasks, which are currently less understood and underperforming. By integrating sparsity tools—long known for their efficacy in capturing data structure—SPADE seeks to illuminate the role of data structure in DL and use this insight to advance sparse model solutions. This initiative will lead to the development of a unified theoretical framework that marries the strengths of sparsity with the flexibility and power of DL.\n\nSPADE's innovative approach promises to catalyze a new generation of learning methods and architectures. Its potential impact is vast, envisaging DL advancements in novel domains and tasks that are currently intractable. With a clear focus on theoretical rigor, SPADE is poised to set new benchmarks in these fields, leading to transformative outcomes that could reshape the landscape of DL research and application. The project underscores the significance of a grounded theoretical approach to DL, which will not only enhance performance but also provide a deeper understanding of the learning mechanisms, ultimately fostering innovation in various real-world applications."

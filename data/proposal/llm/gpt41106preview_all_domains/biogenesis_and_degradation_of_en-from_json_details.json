        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"BiogENesis and Degradation of Endoplasmic Reticulum proteins\" project aims to unravel the complex network of protein biogenesis, folding, and degradation within the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. Leveraging cutting-edge Cryo-electron tomography (CET) coupled with sophisticated computational analysis, this research seeks to provide unprecedented subnanometer resolution images of the ER protein network. Our objectives are to explore the molecular details of ER protein biogenesis and homeostasis, including the structure and dynamics of the ER translocon, the multifaceted process of cotranslational ER import, N-glycosylation, chaperone-mediated stabilization, folding, oligomerization of model substrates like the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) classes I and II, and the degradation of misfolded proteins via the cytosolic 26S proteasome.\n\nOur methods include CET of cellular and cell-free systems, computational sub-tomogram averaging, and in silico purification, which will advance our understanding of native macromolecular states. We aim to provide a new blueprint for structural biology research on membrane-associated processes. The research will also study the ER-bound translation machinery's structural changes under ER stress conditions, particularly focusing on IRE1-mediated mRNA degradation.\n\nThe implications of this project are far-reaching, with potential contributions to understanding chronic diseases related to ER stress, such as diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, it will offer insights into viral immune evasion and glycosylation disorders, paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches. Our project promises a comprehensive look at the ER protein network, with the goal of elucidating mechanisms that maintain cellular health and contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"BiogENesis and Degradation of Endoplasmic Reticulum proteins\" project aims to elucidate the intricate processes governing the biogenesis and homeostatic regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins. By employing cutting-edge Cryo-electron tomography (CET) complemented with advanced computational analysis and sub-tomogram averaging, this research will provide unprecedented structural insights at subnanometer resolution into the ER protein network of eukaryotic cells. The project encompasses a detailed investigation of the ER translocon, the gateway for cotranslational import and N-glycosylation, and the folding and oligomerization of model substrates, including Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and II molecules. \n\nA central objective is to reveal the molecular details of ER protein biogenesis and homeostasis, focusing on the structure and dynamics of the translocon. Additionally, the study will address how the ER machinery responds to misfolded proteins, employing the 26S proteasome system as a model for degradation. This aspect is particularly relevant to understanding how the cytomegalovirus manipulates the immune system by depleting MHC class I molecules. The project will also scrutinize the structural changes in the ER-bound translation machinery under conditions of ER stress, closely examining the IRE1-mediated mRNA degradation pathway. \n\nFurther, the research will refine and apply 'in silico purification' techniques to various native macromolecular states, enhancing the field's ability to study membrane-associated processes. The expected contributions of this project are manifold, promising new perspectives in structural biology, insights into viral immune evasion, glycosylation disorders, and the etiology of diseases associated with chronic ER stress, such as diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, the proposed study will set a new blueprint for understanding and manipulating the ER protein network, with far-reaching implications for biomedical research and therapeutic development.",

These two very successful theories are incompatible, and understanding how to unify them in a single framework is an outstanding problem. String theory is the most prominent candidate for a unified theory of all forces of Nature. The most important conceptual breakthrough that emerged from string theory is Maldacena's conjectured duality between quantum field theory and gravity, known as AdS/CFT correspondence. This states that strings moving in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time, may equivalently be described by a type of quantum theory, called conformal field theory (CFT). More generally, it is a remarkable duality between quantum gauge theories in d dimensions and gravitational theories in (d+1)-dimensional space-times, implying that quantum theory and gravity, instead of being conflicting, are in fact equivalent. In this project I will aim at extending the gauge/gravity duality in multiple directions, which go beyond the current state of the art. In order to achieve a deeper understanding of the gauge/gravity duality I plan to develop novel mathematical approaches, that are likely to lead to new research directions in different areas of physics and mathematics. More specifically, the objectives of this project include: a systematic study of AdS backgrounds arising in string theory as a method for exploring CFTs; the development of geometric structures, such as generalised Sasaki-Einstein geometry, relevant for the AdS/CFT correspondence; a study of supersymmetric gauge theories on curved manifolds and of their gravity duals; a study of dualities between pairs of gauge theories and of related matrix models arising from localisation techniques; exploring the gauge/gravity duality as a tool for studying strongly interacting quantum critical phenomena, such as those that are of interest to real-world physics."

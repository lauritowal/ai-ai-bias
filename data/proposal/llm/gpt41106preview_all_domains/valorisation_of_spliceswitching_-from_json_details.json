        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Valorisation of Splice-Switching Oligonucleotides for Lung Cancer Therapy\n\nLung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with lung adenocarcinoma being especially prevalent. Current therapies are limited by efficacy, highlighting the critical need for novel treatment strategies. This proposal details the development and valorisation of splicing-modifying antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) that have shown promise in modulating alternative splicing, thereby repressing cell growth in vitro and inhibiting tumour growth in preclinical models and patient-derived xenografts in mice.\n\nBuilding upon the successful outcomes of the ERC-funded MASCP project, this proposal seeks to test the therapeutic value of intranasally administered SSOs in combination with chemotherapy. Optimizations in dose and delivery route are required to enhance therapeutic efficacy. The proposal is supported by other healthcare innovation funds and has garnered interest from various stakeholders.\n\nThe overarching experimental goal is to validate the SSOs in patient-derived xenografts, aiming to establish a spin-off company for the commercialisation of this innovative therapy. Activities include intellectual property protection and venture capital recruitment. The valorisation potential of this research is significant, bridging the gap to market and offering added societal value.\n\nThe clinical relevance of this work is underscored by the high incidence and poor prognosis of lung cancer, coupled with the lack of efficient therapies. The anticipated outcome includes not only the provision of a new therapeutic option but also the establishment of a business entity to facilitate the translation of this fundamental knowledge into a tangible medical application. This proposal, therefore, represents a critical step towards improving lung cancer outcomes and exemplifies the societal and market value of translational biomedical research.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Valorisation of splice-switching oligonucleotides for lung cancer therapy\" project aims to capitalize on previously discovered molecular mechanisms that modulate gene regulation to create novel therapeutic interventions for lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, which is marked by high incidence rates, poor prognosis, and a significant unmet need for effective treatments. Building on the successes of the ERC-funded MASCP project, this proposal seeks to advance our understanding of antisense oligonucleotides that can switch splicing patterns of cancer-related genes. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the potential of these reagents to repress cancer cell growth and inhibit tumor progression in mouse models, respectively.\n\nThe project's primary goal is to evaluate the therapeutic value of these antisense oligonucleotides in patient-derived xenografts in mice, utilizing an intranasal delivery route. Optimization of dose and delivery methods are critical components of the research to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Moreover, the therapeutic effectiveness will be assessed in conjunction with standard chemotherapy treatments to explore potential synergies.\n\nFurther valorisation activities include the protection of intellectual property, recruitment of venture capital, and the establishment of a spin-off company to bridge the gap between laboratory findings and market availability. The project's societal value lies in its potential to provide added value for patients suffering from lung cancer through improved therapeutic options.\n\nThis proposal is contingent upon funding from the ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) program and other healthcare innovation funds, which will support these translational efforts and stakeholder interests. The envisioned outcomes promise a significant advance in the treatment of lung cancer and serve as a model for addressing similar challenges in oncology and other areas of unmet clinical need.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Valorisation of splice-switching oligonucleotides for lung cancer therapy\" proposal seeks to harness the therapeutic potential of splicing-modifying antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma, a cancer with a high incidence and poor prognosis. Building on the ERC-funded MASCP project's success, this proposal aims to translate in vitro and in vivo research findings into clinical applications. Evidence indicates that ASOs can modulate the alternative splicing of cancer genes, leading to the suppression of cell growth in vitro and the inhibition of tumor growth in preclinical mouse models.\n\nThe project's experimental goal is to evaluate the therapeutic value of these ASOs in patient-derived xenografts in mice, particularly focusing on intranasal delivery routes to optimize dose and administration. In conjunction, the efficacy of ASOs will be tested in combination with established chemotherapy treatments. With support from healthcare innovation funds, the project has garnered interest from various stakeholders, highlighting its potential societal value and clinical relevance.\n\nThe funding needs identified include securing intellectual property and attracting venture capital to facilitate the creation of a spin-off company. This will enable the valorisation of the research, bridging the gap between laboratory discoveries and marketable cancer therapies. The proposed activities align with the ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) program, emphasizing the importance of translating fundamental knowledge of gene regulation into tangible societal benefits.\n\nBy addressing the lack of efficient therapies for lung cancer, this project promises to offer novel treatment options, improve patient outcomes, and create added value for society through the commercial exploitation of cutting-edge biomedical innovations.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Valorisation of Splice-Switching Oligonucleotides for Lung Cancer Therapy\" project is a groundbreaking initiative aimed at bridging the gap between basic molecular research and clinical applications in the fight against lung adenocarcinoma, a condition with high incidence, poor prognosis, and inadequate existing therapies. Leveraging the findings from the ERC-funded MASCP project, this proposal seeks to capitalize on splicing-modifying antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs) that have demonstrated the capability to modulate alternative splicing, repress cell growth in vitro, and inhibit tumor growth in vivo, when administered intranasally.\n\nOur experimental goal is to assess the therapeutic value of SSOs in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in mice, a significant step towards validating their potential as a novel lung cancer treatment. The research will encompass testing SSOs in combination with chemotherapy, requiring optimization of dose and delivery route to ensure maximum efficacy and patient compatibility. Other valorisation activities include intellectual property protection and venture capital recruitment, with the ultimate business goal of establishing a spin-off company to facilitate the transition of this promising therapy from the laboratory to the market.\n\nThe project is supported by other healthcare innovation funds and has garnered interest from various stakeholders, indicating its potential for societal benefit. The ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) program is identified as a crucial funding need to advance these objectives. The anticipated outcome includes not only the advancement of a novel therapeutic strategy but also the enhancement of the European innovation landscape through the creation of intellectual property and new business opportunities in the healthcare sector. This proposal represents a strategic investment in the future of lung cancer therapy and the broader biotechnology industry."

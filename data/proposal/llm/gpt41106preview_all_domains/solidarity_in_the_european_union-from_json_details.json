        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Solidarity in the European Union\" project seeks to articulate a comprehensive normative model of solidarity tailored to the unique historical and political context of the European Union (EU). The project will develop this model (EUSOL1) by integrating principles of socioeconomic justice, addressing crucial questions on the obligations of social justice that transcend national borders among EU member states. The aim is to establish the grounds for these obligations and to apply the normative model (EUSOL2) to central issues currently challenging the EU's cohesion, such as the free movement of persons, sharing the burden of refugee policy, inter-state financial transfers, and the processes of enlargement and accession. This study is of paramount importance as it will contribute to normative debates on the nature of the EU, international/global justice, and the role of facts in normative political theory, providing a vital account of the value of solidarity in European integration. It addresses some of the most pressing issues facing the EU today, offering a theoretical framework for policymakers and stakeholders to navigate through the complexities of regional unification.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Solidarity in the European Union\" project seeks to develop a comprehensive normative model of solidarity (EUSOL1) tailored to the unique circumstances and historical context of the European Union. This model will provide a principled foundation for understanding and addressing the obligations of social justice that transcend national borders within the EU. With the aim of applying this model to central issues (EUSOL2), such as free movement of persons, burden-sharing in refugee policy, inter-state financial transfers, and policies regarding enlargement and accession, the project promises to inform and potentially transform critical policy debates. The project's relevance is underscored by its focus on some of the most pressing challenges currently faced by the EU, offering insights into the nature of EU development, international/global justice, and the role of facts in normative political theory. By articulating the socioeconomic justice implications of solidarity, the project endeavors to enrich normative debates and contribute to a deeper understanding of European integration.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Solidarity in the European Union\" project seeks to provide a groundbreaking normative account of solidarity tailored to the unique historical and situational context of the European Union. It aims to develop a comprehensive model of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity (EUSOL1) and apply this model to central issues currently polarizing the EU (EUSOL2). These issues include the free movement of persons, burden-sharing within the Union's refugee policy, fiscal inter-state transfers, and the challenges of enlargement and accession. The project will explore the socioeconomic justice obligations that transcend member state borders and the foundational grounds for such obligations. By engaging with the fields of the EU's nature and development, international/global justice, and the role of facts in normative political theory, the project will provide essential insights into some of the most pressing issues facing the European Union today. The outcome is expected to enrich normative debates and offer practical frameworks for solidarity in European integration, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and just EU.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Solidarity in the European Union\" project seeks to articulate a normative model of solidarity tailored to the unique historical and situational context of the European Union (EU). This project, grounded in principles of socioeconomic justice, addresses the critical question of the obligations of social justice that transcend national borders within the EU. The primary aim (EUSOL1) is to develop a theoretical framework of inter-, trans-, and supra-national solidarity that is responsive to the EU's particular challenges. The second aim (EUSOL2) involves applying this model to four central and divisive issues within the EU: free movement of persons, burden-sharing in refugee policy, inter-state transfers, and the process of enlargement and accession.\n\nThis initiative is significant for normative debates on the EU's nature and development, international and global justice, and the interaction between empirical facts and normative political theory. By focusing on solidarity as a core value in European integration, the project has direct relevance to some of the most pressing issues facing the EU today, offering a comprehensive approach to understanding and resolving the tensions inherent in a diverse union of states."

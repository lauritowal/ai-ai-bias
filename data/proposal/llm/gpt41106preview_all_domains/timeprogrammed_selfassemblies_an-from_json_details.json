        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, entitled \"Time-Programmed Self-Assemblies and Dynamic Materials,\" aims to revolutionize the field of materials science by introducing the ability to precisely program the time domain of self-assemblies in closed systems, thereby achieving transient self-assembled states with autonomous dynamics and self-regulation behavior. The project's objective is to create materials that can self-organize and disorganize in a controlled fashion, using energy dissipation and active feedback mechanisms to maintain non-equilibrium conditions that enable transient dynamics.\n\nThe proposed methodology includes mastering the kinetics of assembly/disassembly steps, utilizing a generic pH-feedback system for programming the lifetime of pH-switchable self-assemblies, and developing ATP-fueled, catalytic, dissipative self-assemblies that employ antagonistic enzymes. These approaches will be applied to peptide and DNA-based materials, focusing on achieving the highest control over structure formation, tunable pH switching points, and susceptibility to enzymatic transformations.\n\nResearch will investigate the increased complexity and length scales of self-assembly kinetics, the mechanistic details of phase transitions, and the steady-state dynamics of these transient states. Through the progression of molecular motifs, peptide nanofibrils, DNA-based Au-NP superlattices, and hydrogels, the project seeks to enable dynamic materials with self-regulation and time-programmed memory functions. These advancements have potential applications in self-erasing hydrogels for microfluidic systems and reversible shape memory actuators for soft robotics.\n\nThe long-term goal is to approach the first applications as biomaterials, contrasting existing materials that function solely by structure with those that function by programming the time domain. By integrating active feedback mechanisms and energy dissipation, the project aspires to create active and adaptive soft matter, setting a new paradigm for the design of dynamic materials.",

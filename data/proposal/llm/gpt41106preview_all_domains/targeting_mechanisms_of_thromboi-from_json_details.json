        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Targeting Mechanisms of Thrombo-inflammation\n\nThe proposed research seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning thrombo-inflammation, a pathological process that is central to the progression of a variety of diseases including viral/bacterial infections, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Thrombo-inflammation has been brought to the forefront of clinical concern by the recent Covid-19 pandemic. The project is built upon a recent discovery that highlights the interaction between tissue factor (TF, F3, CD142) and the interferon-alpha/beta receptor alpha chain (IFNAR1) forming a heterodimer that acts as a molecular switch on resting cells. Activation of this switch by stimuli such as fVII/fVIIa, LPS, and polyIC can lead to TF-mediated coagulation, IFNAR1-mediated inflammation, and altered cellular metabolism.\n\nThe research aims to investigate the regulation of this molecular switch, the consequences of its activation for intracellular signaling, inflammation, and mitochondrial metabolism, and to identify the critical molecular structures required for the TF-IFNAR1 interaction. These objectives will be pursued through a combination of in vitro work, the use of cell-specific inducible TF±IFNAR1 deficient mice, omics and bioinformatic analyses, cross-linking, crystallography, phage display, and computational modeling.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for thrombo-inflammatory diseases. By providing a deeper understanding of the molecular switch that controls coagulation, inflammation, and metabolism, this project promises to deliver a new conceptual framework for addressing thrombo-inflammatory conditions, with potential broad-spectrum impacts across multiple disease domains.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Targeting mechanisms of Thrombo-inflammation\" aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie thrombo-inflammation, a pathological condition of critical relevance exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Thrombo-inflammation is a complex interplay of processes impairing the outcome of various pathologies including viral/bacterial infections, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. This proposal hinges on a recent discovery that posits a molecular switch involving the tissue factor (TF, F3, CD142) and IFNAR1 heterodimer, which remains inactive on resting cells. Activation stimuli such as fVII/fVIIa, LPS, and polyIC trigger the heterodimer, leading to TF-mediated coagulation, IFNAR1-mediated inflammation, and altered cellular metabolism.\n\nOur research aims to: (1) Investigate the regulation of the molecular switch involving TF and IFNAR1 in an organ/context-specific fashion using in vitro experiments and cell-specific inducible TF±IFNAR1 deficient mice; (2) Determine the consequences of this molecular switch for intracellular signaling, inflammation, and mitochondrial metabolism through omics and bioinformatic analyses; (3) Identify the molecular structures required for the TF-IFNAR1 interaction using cross-linking, crystallography, phage display, and computational modeling.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this proposal include the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for thrombo-inflammatory diseases. By providing a novel conceptual framework for understanding the molecular basis of thrombo-inflammation, our work has the potential to revolutionize the treatment and management of a broad spectrum of diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare burdens.\n\n(Word Count: 254)",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Targeting mechanisms of Thrombo-inflammation\" project is designed to unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying thrombo-inflammatory diseases, which have been thrust into the spotlight by the Covid-19 pandemic. Central to this proposal is the investigation of the tissue factor (TF, F3, CD142) and IFNAR1 (Interferon-alpha/beta receptor alpha chain) heterodimer, a novel molecular switch that lies dormant on resting cells but is activated by stimuli such as fVII/fVIIa, LPS, and polyIC. This activation initiates TF-mediated coagulation, IFNAR1-mediated inflammation, and alterations in cellular metabolism—processes that are imperative in the progression of various diseases including viral/bacterial infections, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\n\nThe research will be conducted through three interrelated aims: First, to investigate the regulation of the TF and IFNAR1 molecular switch, employing in vitro work and cell-specific inducible TF±IFNAR1 deficient mice. Second, to determine the switch's consequences for intracellular signaling, inflammation, and mitochondrial metabolism, using omics and bioinformatics analyses. Third, to identify the molecular structures required for the TF-IFNAR1 interaction through cross-linking, crystallography, phage display, and computational modeling.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this comprehensive study are groundbreaking—paving the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for thrombo-inflammatory diseases. By exploring this molecular switch's regulation, consequences, and structural requirements, the project endeavors to provide a conceptual framework that could revolutionize the understanding and treatment of diseases with thrombo-inflammatory components.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Targeting mechanisms of Thrombo-inflammation\" embarks on a groundbreaking exploration to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of thrombo-inflammatory diseases, a critical area of research magnified by the Covid-19 pandemic. While tissue factor (TF) and the IFNAR1 heterodimer have been identified as pivotal to the pathology of diseases ranging from viral/bacterial infections to cardiovascular complications and cancer, our understanding of their interaction remains limited. This proposal sets out to deconstruct the molecular switch involving TF and IFNAR1, which remains inactive on resting cells but can be triggered by various stimuli, including fVII/fVIIa, LPS, and polyIC, leading to TF-mediated coagulation, IFNAR1-mediated inflammation, and altered cellular metabolism.\n\nOur objectives are threefold: (1) to investigate the regulation of the TF-IFNAR1 molecular switch in an organ and context-specific manner, utilizing in vitro studies and cell-specific inducible TF±IFNAR1 deficient mice; (2) to determine the consequences of this switch on intracellular signaling, inflammatory processes, and mitochondrial metabolism through omics and bioinformatic analyses; and (3) to identify the essential molecular structures that facilitate the TF-IFNAR1 interaction using advanced techniques such as cross-linking, crystallography, phage display, and computational modeling.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of this research is twofold: to provide a novel conceptual framework for understanding the complex interplay of coagulation, inflammation, and metabolism in thrombo-inflammation, and to pave the way for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for these pervasive diseases. Our comprehensive approach promises to yield significant insights that could revolutionize the management and treatment of thrombo-inflammatory conditions, with broad implications for global health.\n\nWord Count: 254 words"

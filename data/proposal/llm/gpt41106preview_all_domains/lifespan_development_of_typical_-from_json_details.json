        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"MULTISENSE\" project, entitled \"Lifespan Development of Typical and Atypical Multisensory Perception,\" aims to elucidate the trajectory of multisensory integration in the human brain, from childhood through non-elderly adulthood to older age. Focusing on both synaesthetes, who experience a blending of senses, and nonsynaesthetes, this four-year interdisciplinary study seeks to answer how multisensory integration abilities develop and differ across various life stages.\n\nThe MULTISENSE project will employ a variety of cognitive tests and experimental techniques to examine phenomena such as multisensory integration, implicit associations across senses, and cross-sensory interactions. A significant innovation of this research is the development of a state-of-the-art assessment tool specifically designed for child synaesthetes. Through this, the project will offer a novel contribution to the nascent field of childhood synaesthesia research and establish a new domain investigating synaesthesia in aging populations.\n\nBy evaluating multisensory functions across the lifespan, the project expects to provide substantial feedback and frameworks for researchers, educational policy makers, and future academics. The outcomes include developing a comprehensive understanding of typical and atypical multisensory perception, and this knowledge will be pivotal in shaping educational strategies and therapeutic interventions for affected populations.\n\nThe beneficiaries of this research extend beyond individuals with synaesthesia, as the insights gained will have broader applications in understanding sensory processing and integration, which are fundamental to all human experience and learning. The project's integration of developmental, cognitive, and neurological perspectives positions it to make a profound impact on the fields of sensory perception and developmental psychology.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe MULTISENSE project, titled \"Lifespan Development of Typical and Atypical Multisensory Perception,\" aims to elucidate the developmental trajectory of multisensory integration in the human brain, with a focus on individuals with and without synaesthesia. Spanning across crucial life stages—childhood, non-elderly adulthood, and older age—this four-year research initiative seeks to unravel the complexities of how our senses coalesce to form a cohesive perceptual experience and how this process may differ in synaesthetes, who experience a blending of senses.\n\nThe project proposes a multifaceted approach, employing cognitive tests and experimental techniques to investigate the nature of multisensory integration, implicit associations across senses, and cross-sensory interactions. A significant innovation of MULTISENSE will be the development of a state-of-the-art assessment tool specifically designed for child synaesthetes, which will not only advance the field of childhood synaesthesia research but also provide valuable insights into the evolution of sensory integration from an early age.\n\nMULTISENSE is structured around four work programmes, each contributing to a comprehensive evaluation of multisensory functions across the lifespan. The outcomes of this research are poised to offer feedback to both researchers and educational policy makers, setting the stage for informed decisions in academic and educational contexts. Furthermore, the project is committed to establishing a novel field of inquiry into synaesthesia and aging, an area currently underexplored.\n\nBy integrating the findings from diverse age groups and conditions, MULTISENSE will provide a groundbreaking framework that benefits current and future academics in the pursuit of understanding the human sensory experience. Through its expected contributions, the project endeavors to foster a transformative impact on our comprehension of typical and atypical multisensory perception across the human lifespan.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Lifespan Development of Typical and Atypical Multisensory Perception\" (MULTISENSE) project is an ambitious initiative aiming to dissect and explain the development of multisensory integration in the human brain. This four-year research endeavor will scrutinize how individuals with and without synaesthesia differ in their ability to process and integrate multisensory information from childhood through non-elderly adulthood to older age. \n\nMULTISENSE is poised to address the gap in our understanding of how multisensory integration evolves and functions across different life stages. By focusing on populations of synaesthetes and nonsynaesthetes, the project will shed light on typical and atypical perceptual phenomena such as multisensory integration, implicit associations across senses, and cross-sensory interactions. \n\nThe project will be executed through four distinct work programmes, utilizing a combination of cognitive tests and experimental techniques. A key deliverable will be the development of a state-of-the-art assessment tool specifically designed for child synaesthetes, which has the potential to revolutionize diagnosis and intervention strategies. \n\nExpected outcomes include an evaluation of multisensory functions across the lifespan and the establishment of robust frameworks for researchers, educational policy makers, and future academics. MULTISENSE will contribute to the development of the field of childhood synaesthesia research and pioneer a novel field in synaesthesia and aging. The findings are anticipated to provide invaluable feedback to researchers and inform educational policy, thereby benefiting a broad range of stakeholders.\n\nBy integrating developmental, cognitive, and neuroscientific approaches, MULTISENSE stands to provide groundbreaking insights into the complexities of the human sensory experience and its evolution from infancy to old age. The project promises to advance our comprehension of the brain's integration processes and pave the way for innovative educational and clinical practices.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe 'Lifespan Development of Typical and Atypical Multisensory Perception' project, designated as MULTISENSE, proposes an innovative and comprehensive exploration of how multisensory integration abilities develop and vary between individuals with and without synaesthesia across different life stages: childhood, non-elderly adulthood, and older age. Spanning over 48 months and consisting of four work programmes, MULTISENSE aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of multisensory perception and to contribute to our understanding of both typical and atypical perceptual phenomena.\n\nUtilizing a combination of cognitive tests and experimental techniques, the project strives to develop a state-of-the-art assessment tool specifically for child synaesthetes. Through this endeavor, MULTISENSE will evaluate multisensory functions across the lifespan, filling crucial gaps in the literature by developing the nascent field of childhood synaesthesia research and pioneering the novel field of synaesthesia research in aging populations.\n\nSignificant expected outcomes of the project include a comprehensive evaluation of multisensory integration abilities, which will provide valuable feedback to researchers and educational policy makers. Furthermore, the project is set to establish a framework that current and future academics can utilize to further investigate multisensory perception phenomena.\n\nMULTISENSE sets forth a robust agenda to investigate and characterize the trajectory of multisensory perception development, emphasizing the distinct experiences of synaesthetes versus nonsynaesthetes. The knowledge generated from this project is anticipated to have widespread benefits, not only advancing scientific knowledge in the field of neurodevelopment and cognitive neuroscience but also informing educational strategies and interventions for individuals with synaesthesia. Through a multidisciplinary approach, MULTISENSE aspires to make a lasting contribution to the understanding of human sensory experience and its integration over the course of a lifetime."

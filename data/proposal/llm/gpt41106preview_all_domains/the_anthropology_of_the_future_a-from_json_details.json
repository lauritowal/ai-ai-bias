        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The anthropology of the future: An art world perspective\" (ANTHROFUTURE), innovatively interrogates how the COVID-19 pandemic has compressed time by catapulting the future into our present reality, particularly within the global art world. This research aims to systematically examine the intersection of digital and physical spaces in the art world as an ethnographic site for understanding future dynamics. Concentrating on India and Pakistan within the global south, ANTHROFUTURE seeks to contribute to the scant scholarship on the post-pandemic evolution of art world infrastructures.\n\nThe central objectives of this project are threefold: to conduct systematic research on the digital-physical art world, to deploy innovative multimodal methodologies, and to foster analytical and theoretical advancements regarding the concept of the future as a distinct time zone. The research methodology encompasses in-person, digital, and visual ethnography, combined with large-scale social media data harvesting and collaborative artist subprojects to create a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the subject matter.\n\nANTHROFUTURE is poised to explore critical regional contexts of social, ecological, and biopolitical crises through key concepts such as decolonisation, experimentalism, future-orientation, and the interplay of risk and speculation. The project will also introduce novel modes of inquiry, integrating three innovative approaches to ethnographic study.\n\nThe project leader brings extensive research experience on the art world and global south studies, ensuring a rich foundation for this venture. Through its insights, ANTHROFUTURE aspires to build a new integrated physical and digital system for the art world and model future-oriented practices in the global south. The outcomes of this research will not only advance scholarly understanding but also inform practitioners and policymakers invested in the intersection of art, technology, and society in the face of unprecedented global challenges.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Anthropology of the Future: An Art World Perspective\n\nThe proposed project, ANTHROFUTURE, is an innovative exploration of the art world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on how the crisis has precipitated an acceleration of the future into the present, particularly in the digital-physical integration within the art world of the global south. This anthropological study will extend across India and Pakistan, serving as the central ethnographic sites to examine future imaginations amidst social, ecological, and biopolitical crises.\n\nObjectives of ANTHROFUTURE include conducting systematic research within the digital-physical art sphere, applying innovative multimodal methodologies, and fostering analytical and theoretical advancements concerning the future as a unique time zone. The research will combine in-person, digital, and visual ethnography, coupled with large-scale social media data harvesting and artist subprojects to capture a comprehensive view of the art world's evolution in response to the pandemic.\n\nThe project will address a critical gap in scholarship regarding the post-pandemic art world's digital-physical infrastructure, particularly as it relates to the global south. The objectives will be pursued through three novel modes of inquiry: ethnographic studies, data analysis, and collaborative art projects, which will collectively provide insights into the emerging integrated physical and digital system for the art world.\n\nThe project leader brings extensive experience in researching the art world and its dynamics within the global south, ensuring a deep understanding of the regional contexts and a rich background in the field. ANTHROFUTURE aims to model the future of the art world in the global south, contributing to a richer understanding of how societies envision and navigate the future through the lens of art and culture, with implications for broader anthropological and sociological scholarship.\n\nKeywords: Anthropology, Future Studies, Art World, Digital-Physical Integration, Ethnography, COVID-19 Pandemic, Global South.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"The Anthropology of the Future: An Art World Perspective\" (ANTHROFUTURE), is poised to pioneer an ethnographic exploration of how the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the fusion of the future into our present reality. With a particular focus on the art world, this research seeks to uncover how current social, ecological, and biopolitical crises are being navigated and expressed through artistic practices, particularly in the digital-physical realms predominant in the global south.\n\nObjectives of ANTHROFUTURE include conducting systematic research on the digital-physical art world as an ethnographic site for the study of the future, deploying innovative multimodal methodologies, and fostering analytical and theoretical advancements regarding the future as a distinct time zone. The project will utilize a trio of ethnographic techniques—in-person, digital, and visual—complemented by large-scale social media data harvesting and artist-led subprojects. These approaches aim to capture the nuanced, complex interactions within the art world that are shaping emergent future-oriented discourses and practices.\n\nResearch will be conducted in India and Pakistan, offering comparative regional perspectives and highlighting the role of the global south in modeling future trajectories. This work will build upon the project leader's extensive research experience in the art world and their expertise in global south studies, ensuring a robust and informed examination of the subject.\n\nANTHROFUTURE addresses a notable gap in scholarship regarding the post-pandemic art world's digital-physical infrastructure. By examining the art world's response to the pandemic, the project aims to contribute a new integrated system for understanding the art world and to provide a blueprint for anticipating and shaping the future in the context of ongoing crises. The project's findings will extend beyond academia, influencing art world practitioners and policymakers by offering innovative solutions and fresh perspectives on the future's intersection with the digital and physical realms.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Anthropology of the Future: An Art World Perspective\" (ANTHROFUTURE) project is a groundbreaking research endeavor that seeks to investigate the rapid acceleration of the future into the present, a phenomenon catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic. With the art world as its ethnographic focus, this project aims to systematically explore the transformative integration of digital and physical realms and its impact on future imaginations, particularly in the face of social, ecological, and biopolitical crises.\n\nThe primary objectives of ANTHROFUTURE are to conduct systematic research on the evolving digital-physical art world, develop innovative multimodal methodologies for studying future orientations, and contribute analytical and theoretical advancements regarding the future as a distinct time zone. The project will employ a combination of in-person, digital, and visual ethnography, alongside large-scale social media data harvesting and artist-led subprojects to gather comprehensive data. The research will be conducted in the regional contexts of India and Pakistan, providing a much-needed perspective from the global south.\n\nANTHROFUTURE is poised to innovate the field of future studies by integrating ethnographic practices with novel digital techniques, addressing the lack of scholarship on the post-pandemic digital-physical infrastructure of the art world. The project will create a new integrated system for understanding and modeling the art world's response to the pandemic, with implications for broader future-oriented scholarship and practice.\n\nLed by a project investigator with extensive experience in both art world and global south studies, ANTHROFUTURE aims to set a precedent for how anthropology can engage with the concept of the future. The project's innovations promise not only to contribute to academic discourse but also to offer practical insights for the burgeoning digital-physical system in the art world."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Reconsidering Constitutional Formation: Constitutional Communication by Drafting, Practice and Interpretation in 18th and 19th century Europe\" (ReConFort) seeks to explore the evolutionary processes of constitutional state genesis through the lens of constituent assemblies and their communication patterns in Europe during the late 18th and 19th centuries. This transdisciplinary research endeavors to understand how constitutions were formed, communicated, and interpreted within socio-cultural and cross-border contexts, examining the dynamic interactions between text, societal milieu, political practices, and constitutional interpretation.\n\nReConFort aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of inedited archival sources, cross-border correspondences, publicistic activities, exile literature, and constitutional journalism to identify common structural criteria and assess the determinants and interdependencies that influenced constitutional formation and communication. By employing both synchronic comparative analysis and systematic diachronic studies, the project will delve into case studies including the Polish Sejm (1788-1792), Spanish Cortes (1810-1812), Belgian National Congress (1830-1831), Frankfurt Parliament (1848-1849), and Italian Parlamento Subalpino (1861).\n\nThe anticipated outcomes include a deeper understanding of mutual influences in European constitutional developments and an assessment of the transnational dynamics of constitutional forming, practice, and interpretation. ReConFort's research outputs will not only enhance academic knowledge but also offer valuable insights for the ongoing European Union integration process, highlighting the historical foundations of constitutional democracy and governance.\n\nReConFort presents an innovative and interactive model to study constitution formation in historic European contexts, promising to fill critical gaps in legal and historical sciences by revealing how constitutional communication shaped the nations and the continent at large.",
        "This grant proposal, entitled \"Reconsidering Constitutional Formation: Constitutional Communication by Drafting, Practice and Interpretation in 18th and 19th century Europe\" (ReConFort), seeks to investigate the genesis and evolution of constitutional states in Europe during the late 18th and 19th centuries. The project focuses on the dynamic interplay between constitutional communication and societal transformation, analyzing the role of constituent assemblies such as the Polish Sejm, Spanish Cortes, Belgian National Congress, Frankfurt Parliament, and Italian Parlamento Subalpino.\n\nReConFort employs an innovative, transdisciplinary approach combining synchronic comparative analysis and diachronic studies to delve into unedited archival sources, cross-border correspondences, publicistic activities, exile literature, and constitutional journalism. This research methodology aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the socio-cultural and cross-border contexts influencing constitutional communication patterns and the Zeitgeist of the time.\n\nThe project's objectives are to identify common structural criteria in constitution-forming processes, assess the determinants and interdependencies of constitutional formation and communication, and enhance our understanding of the mutual influences in European constitutional developments. These findings are anticipated to contribute to the EU integration process, highlighting the historical underpinnings of contemporary constitutional practice.\n\nBy examining constitutional formation through an evolutionary, dynamic, and interactive lens, ReConFort aspires to produce outcomes that will not only illuminate constitutional developments in Europe during a pivotal historical period but also provide valuable insights into the transnational dynamics of constitutional forming, practice, and interpretation, with significant implications for the integration process of the EU.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Reconsidering Constitutional Formation: Constitutional Communication by Drafting, Practice and Interpretation in 18th and 19th century Europe\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Reconsidering Constitutional Formation,\" aims to dissect the complex processes of constitutional state genesis during the late 18th and 19th centuries in Europe. Through an innovative transdisciplinary approach, the project seeks to elucidate how constitutions were shaped not only by their written text but also by societal context, political practice, and cross-border interactions.\n\nBy examining the workings of significant constituent assemblies, including the Polish Sejm, Spanish Cortes, Belgian National Congress, Frankfurt Parliament, and Italian Parlamento Subalpino, the research will conduct synchronic comparative and diachronic studies to uncover the evolutionary nature of constitutional communication. Unedited archival sources, cross-border correspondences, publicistic activities, exile literature, and constitutional journalism will serve as the primary materials, providing a rich and unexplored terrain for analysis.\n\nThe project aims to identify common structural criteria and assess the determinants and interdependencies that influenced constitutional formation and communication. The anticipated outcomes include a comprehensive understanding of the mutual influences in European constitutional developments and an appraisal of the transnational dynamics at play. The insights gained will not only contribute to the historical and legal sciences but are expected to provide valuable context for the ongoing European integration process.\n\nBy applying an evolutionary, dynamic, and interactive model to study constitution formation, ReConFort endeavors to reframe our understanding of constitutional developments, emphasizing the interactivity between drafting, practice, and interpretation within the socio-cultural and cross-border contexts of Europe's formative years.",
        "Abstract:\n\n\"Reconsidering Constitutional Formation: Constitutional Communication by Drafting, Practice and Interpretation in 18th and 19th century Europe\" is a groundbreaking research project aimed at uncovering the intricate processes of constitutional development during a pivotal era in European history. This project will examine the genesis and evolution of constitutional states in Europe, with a particular focus on the socio-cultural and cross-border contexts that influenced constitutional communication, practice, and interpretation.\n\nSpanning the late 18th to the 19th century, the research will investigate key constituent assemblies such as the Polish Sejm, Spanish Cortes, Belgian National Congress, Frankfurt Parliament, and Italian Parlamento Subalpino. By employing a transdisciplinary approach that combines legal and historical sciences, the project will utilize unedited archival sources, cross-border correspondences, publicistic activities, exile literature, and constitutional journalism to conduct both synchronic comparative analysis and systematic diachronic studies.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes include the identification of common structural criteria and an assessment of determinants and interdependencies that shaped constitutional formation. The project will enhance our understanding of constitutional developments and highlight the transnational dynamics of constitutional forming, practice, and interpretation, thus providing invaluable insights for the ongoing EU integration process.\n\nReConFort applies an evolutionary, dynamic, and interactive concept to the study of constitution formation, offering a novel perspective on the interactive model of constitution formation in historic European contexts. The findings of this research will be instrumental in comprehending the historical underpinnings of modern constitutionalism and its implications for Europe's political and social integration."

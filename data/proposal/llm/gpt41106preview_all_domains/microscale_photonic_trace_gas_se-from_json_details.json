        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Micro-Scale Photonic Trace Gas Sensor\" project represents a transformative leap in the domain of trace gas sensing technology, with profound implications for environmental monitoring, industrial process control, and healthcare. Building upon the ERC Starting Grant project sCENT, which achieved the first chip-scale sensor capable of part-per-billion (ppb) level detection and selectivity equivalent to high-end instruments, this proposal seeks to enhance the readiness of this pioneering technology.\n\nLeveraging a novel waveguide design that supports air-like modes, the current project endeavors to develop a prototype module that retains the groundbreaking sensitivity, selectivity, and isotope detection capabilities of its predecessor, while being compact, lightweight, and requiring only microlitre sample volumes. The prototype will be rigorously tested through a demonstration studying metabolic emissions of methane-consuming bacteria in permafrost soils—an application with significant ramifications for understanding and mitigating climate change.\n\nThis endeavor is not only a technical pursuit but also encompasses strategic business aspects, including IP protection management, monitoring target markets, and designing a technology roadmap to guide the progression to market. The project targets the environmental intelligence market, with a vision to unlock opportunities for large-scale in-situ gas monitoring that offers unparalleled data density. Outreach activities will ensure the promotion of the sensor to potential commercial partners, end-users, and stakeholders, fostering an ecosystem conducive to innovation and practical application.\n\nIn summary, the \"Micro-Scale Photonic Trace Gas Sensor\" project aims to provide a robust, field-deployable sensor system, achieving a new standard in trace gas analysis and catalyzing significant advancements in a range of critical sectors.",

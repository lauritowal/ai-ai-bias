        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Shaped Hybrid Forward Error Correction\" (SHY-FEC), aims to revolutionize high-speed communication systems by developing a novel algorithm that significantly lowers energy consumption while maintaining high performance and throughput. The project addresses the current limitations of VLSI-implemented soft and hard-decision FEC, which are proving costly for the telecommunication industry, specifically impacting designers, device manufacturers, and system-level integrators. The SHY-FEC solution fuses hybrid channel coding with low-complexity constellation shaping, a groundbreaking approach that promises to alleviate the environmental impact by reducing the ICT sector's electricity use, which currently ranges between 5–9% of the world's total, with FEC alone accounting for 15% of receiver energy consumption.\n\nThe project's primary goal is to achieve performance levels comparable to the state-of-the-art soft-decision FEC, but with at least one order of magnitude lower in energy consumption. This significant reduction in power usage will be beneficial for wireless systems and short/medium-haul fiber optics applications, providing an incremental improvement that is both cost-effective and time-efficient.\n\nThe project will unfold in two phases: technology feasibility and pre-commercialization activities. These phases are designed to validate the SHY-FEC algorithm's practicality and prepare it for market integration. The anticipated benefits of SHY-FEC include simplifying the current complex FEC approaches, enabling high-throughput, and substantially reducing energy consumption, thereby addressing the pressing need for more sustainable communication technologies. This innovation stands to not only enhance the telecommunication network value chain but also contribute to global energy conservation efforts.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis proposal introduces the Shaped Hybrid Forward Error Correction (SHY-FEC) as an innovative solution designed to overcome the limitations of current VLSI-implemented FEC systems in high-performance, high-speed communication networks. SHY-FEC aims to achieve the performance levels of soft-decision FEC while significantly reducing energy consumption by at least one order of magnitude. The approach leverages a novel blend of hybrid channel coding with low-complexity constellation shaping, thereby addressing the critical need for low-power, high-throughput error correction algorithms.\n\nGiven that the ICT sector accounts for 5-9% of the world's total electricity use, with FEC systems alone contributing to 15% of receiver energy consumption, SHY-FEC stands to make a substantial environmental impact. The proposed solution anticipates benefits such as reduced complexity and energy expenditure, which are vital for stakeholders across the telecommunication network value chain, including designers, device manufacturers, and system level integrators.\n\nThe project is set to undergo phases of technology feasibility and pre-commercialisation activities. These steps will validate the SHY-FEC for wireless systems and short/medium-haul fibre optics applications, thereby propelling incremental advancements in the industry. This project not only addresses the distress in the telecommunication network value chain but also aligns with global efforts to decrease the environmental footprint of the ICT sector. The successful implementation of SHY-FEC could revolutionize the efficiency of future communication systems, providing a sustainable and high-efficiency solution for the rapidly growing demands of data centres, cloud services, and connectivity.",

        "Abstract:\n\nThe rapid expansion of data-intensive applications necessitates the development of high-performance, high-speed, and energy-efficient communication systems. Current state-of-the-art Forward Error Correction (FEC) solutions, primarily implemented using Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) techniques, have reached a plateau in terms of performance and energy efficiency, which significantly impacts the telecommunication industry, including designers, device manufacturers, and system integrators. This proposal introduces the \"Shaped Hybrid Forward Error Correction\" (SHY-FEC) as an innovative solution to this challenge.\n\nSHY-FEC promises to address the high energy consumption and complexity issues associated with existing FEC techniques by combining hybrid channel coding with low-complexity constellation shaping. This innovative approach is anticipated to deliver performance levels akin to those of soft-decision FEC while achieving at least one order of magnitude lower in energy consumption. Such advancements are crucial as the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector currently accounts for 5-9% of the world's total electricity use, with FEC energy consumption alone comprising 15% of receiver energy in connectivity systems.\n\nThe proposed SHY-FEC algorithm aims to benefit a wide range of applications, including wireless systems and short/medium-haul fiber optics. The project will undergo phases of technology feasibility and pre-commercialization activities. This transformative technology not only holds the potential to alleviate the distress in the telecommunication network value chain but also contributes significantly towards reducing the environmental impact by lowering the ICT sector's energy footprint.\n\nThe proposed SHY-FEC is poised to serve as a paradigm shift in FEC technology, offering a scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alternative for next-generation communication networks."

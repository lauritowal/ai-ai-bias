        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Neutrinos and the Origin of the Cosmic Rays\n\nSince the breakthrough year of 2013, the fields of astrophysics and particle physics have progressively converged to address some of the most compelling questions about the universe. The proposed project, \"Neutrinos and the Origin of the Cosmic Rays,\" aims to explore the composition of cosmic ray flux and the acceleration mechanisms of heavy nuclei within astrophysical sources. This multidisciplinary effort will merge the expertise from both fields to answer critical questions about the origins and properties of cosmic rays and neutrinos, providing insights into potential new physics only observable at extreme energies, distances, or densities.\n\nThe project's goals are to identify the origin of cosmic rays and cosmic neutrinos, and to solve open questions in particle physics, including the neutrino mass hierarchy and leptonic CP violation. To achieve these objectives, the proposed methodologies include studying the effect of heavy nuclei on source fluxes using multiple messengers—neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma-rays—and optimizing future experiment infrastructure in ice and sea water environments to advance both astrophysical and particle physics applications.\n\nThe project will leverage emerging technologies, such as neutrino telescopes, to measure neutrino properties and examine the consequences for neutrino fluxes and cosmic ray compositions at the sources. The overarching aim is to understand how heavier nuclei can be accelerated and escape without disintegration, which has implications for the astrophysical neutrino fluxes and atmospheric neutrino fluxes.\n\nBy bringing together the research fields of astrophysics and particle physics, the project promises to address the key focus on the origin of cosmic rays and the highest energetic neutrinos, exploring the cutting edge of particle interactions and radiation processes. The anticipated outcomes include not only a deeper understanding of cosmic phenomena but also potential discoveries in new physics, signifying a significant step forward in our comprehension of the universe.",

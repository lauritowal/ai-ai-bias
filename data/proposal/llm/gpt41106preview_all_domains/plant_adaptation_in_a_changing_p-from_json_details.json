        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Plant Adaptation in a Changing Pollination Climate\n\nThe POLLCLIM project aims to advance our comprehension of how alterations in pollination dynamics affect the adaptation of animal-pollinated plants. With a focus on a pollination-generalized wildflower in Southern Scandinavia, this interdisciplinary research initiative will develop a novel conceptual framework to scrutinize the individual and potentially non-additive contributions of diverse pollinator species to natural selection on floral and plant traits.\n\nOver a preparatory duration of three years, POLLCLIM will execute observational field studies across 50 plant populations, conduct controlled experiments, including single-pollinator flight-cage trials, and perform tailored statistical modelling and quantitative-genetic analyses. These methodologies will enable the empirical investigation of phenotypic adaptation and spatio-temporal variation in selection within these populations.\n\nThe research will offer crucial phenotypic adaptation data, unravel the intricacies of pollinator-mediated selection, and elucidate the balance between natural selection and genetic constraints in driving population divergence. Additionally, the project will provide valuable insights into the role of selection in micro- and macroevolution, informing conservation strategies and enhancing our understanding of evolutionary processes under changing environmental conditions.\n\nBy carefully evaluating the contributions of individual pollinators, POLLCLIM seeks to illuminate the complexities of plant responses to the changing pollination climate. Such knowledge is not only fundamental to ecological and evolutionary biology but also essential for predicting plant species' resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing world.\n\n(Expected Word Count: 225)",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, \"Plant adaptation in a changing pollination climate\" (POLLCLIM), seeks to deepen our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences for animal-pollinated plants responding to alterations in their pollination climate. This three-year study, situated in Southern Scandinavia, will target 50 populations of a pollination-generalized wildflower, providing a representative model for examining plant-pollinator interactions across a functionally diverse set of pollinators.\n\nOur objectives include developing a novel conceptual framework that focuses on the non-additive contributions of individual pollinator species to natural selection on plant traits, particularly those involved in pollination. Through a combination of observational field studies, well-replicated controlled experiments, single-pollinator flight-cage experiments, and tailored statistical modelling—including quantitative-genetic analyses—the research aims to dissect the complex interactions between plants and their pollinators. Annual population surveys will track phenotypic adaptation, while selection studies will clarify the spatio-temporal variation in selection pressures exerted by pollinators.\n\nThe outcomes of POLLCLIM are anticipated to provide direct value for understanding how plants adapt and potentially evolve in response to the dynamic nature of pollinator assemblages. This will shed light on the mechanisms of natural selection and the evolutionary processes that shape plant populations at both micro- and macroevolutionary scales. The project's innovative framework emphasizes the multifaceted roles of pollinators, moving beyond additive effects to reveal the nuanced ways in which these agents of selection drive the evolution of plant traits. Insights from this study will be pivotal in predicting and managing the impacts of environmental changes on biodiversity and ecosystem services.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe POLLCLIM project, titled \"Plant adaptation in a changing pollination climate,\" aims to deepen our understanding of how animal-pollinated plants adapt to alterations in their pollination climate. By developing a groundbreaking conceptual framework, the project will assess the implications of changes in the abundance and diversity of pollinators on the evolutionary trajectory of plants. The primary objective is to investigate how individual pollinator species contribute to natural selection on plant traits that facilitate pollination.\n\nPOLLCLIM will focus on a pollination-generalized wildflower in Southern Scandinavia, examining 50 different plant populations. The project will incorporate a multifaceted approach that includes observational field studies, controlled experiments, and tailored statistical modelling. Annual population surveys will be conducted to monitor phenotypic adaptation, and well-replicated selection studies will analyze spatio-temporal variation in selection. Single-pollinator flight-cage experiments will provide estimates of the contribution of each pollinator taxon to selection pressures. Quantitative-genetic analyses will be employed to elucidate population divergence and the interplay between natural selection and genetic constraints.\n\nOur conceptual framework places emphasis on the potential non-additive effects of individual pollinator species on the evolution of pollination traits in plants. The project's expected outcomes include comprehensive data on phenotypic adaptation, the variation of selection over time and space, and the role each pollinator plays in shaping the evolutionary responses of plants. Insights gleaned from POLLCLIM will have direct implications for understanding plant responses to the rapidly changing pollination landscape and will inform conservation strategies that maintain both plant and pollinator biodiversity in the face of environmental change.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe POLLCLIM project, \"Plant adaptation in a changing pollination climate,\" aims to unravel the consequences of shifts in pollination dynamics for animal-pollinated plants. With pollination climates altering globally, the adaptive responses of plants to these changes remain poorly understood. This project seeks to illuminate how variations in pollinator assemblages contribute to natural selection and influence the evolutionary trajectories of plants.\n\nPOLLCLIM will develop a pioneering conceptual framework that underscores the likely non-additive contributions of individual pollinator species to the selection pressures on plant traits. The project will focus on a functionally diverse set of pollinators visiting a pollination-generalized wildflower in Southern Scandinavia. Through a multifaceted approach combining observational field studies of 50 plant populations, controlled single-pollinator flight-cage experiments, and tailored statistical modelling, POLLCLIM will generate empirical data on phenotypic adaptation and elucidate spatio-temporal variation in selection.\n\nQuantitative-genetic analyses will be employed to evaluate how individual pollinators shape plant traits and to extrapolate these effects to larger evolutionary patterns of population divergence. Annual population surveys and well-replicated selection studies will offer a detailed perspective on the interplay between natural selection and genetic constraints.\n\nExpected outcomes include a deeper understanding of plant responses to changing pollination climates and novel insights into the role of selection in both microevolution and macroevolution. By examining the impacts of pollinator-mediated selection, POLLCLIM will contribute significantly to the fields of ecology, evolution, and conservation biology, providing a framework for predicting and managing the evolutionary responses of plant populations in an era of global environmental change."

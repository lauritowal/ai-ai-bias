        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Non-Ergodic Quantum Matter: Universality, Dynamics and Control\n\nIn the realm of quantum physics, the exploration of non-ergodic quantum matter stands at the forefront of enabling technology that defies classical thermal equilibrium expectations. This groundbreaking project, headed by a principal investigator with a deep expertise in many-body localization, aims to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding non-ergodic quantum matter. Our primary objective is to delve into the elusive phases of matter that remain quantum coherent over extended periods, thereby resisting thermalization. This research will encompass the study of established non-ergodic phases, the quest for novel phases, and a profound investigation into their common properties and dynamics.\n\nWith recent experimental advancements, non-ergodic systems have been realized in quantum simulators, presenting a unique opportunity to examine many-body localized phases, glassy and kinetically constrained models, and systems exhibiting weak ergodicity breaking. The project's methodology is designed to describe the universal properties of highly-excited eigenstates and their entanglement structures, develop new methods to simulate non-ergodic dynamics, and identify experimental signatures indicative of non-ergodicity. Additionally, we will explore the use of these quantum phases for many-body state preparation and optimal control.\n\nThe implications of this research are far-reaching, potentially leading to insights into quantum thermalization, providing a theoretical basis to guide the experimental search for non-ergodic phases, and harnessing the properties of these systems for quantum information storage and processing. The expected outcomes include a set of principles that will inform the avoidance of thermal equilibrium, elucidate the universal characteristics of non-ergodic systems, and reveal the nature of their long-time dynamics and steady states. In doing so, we will lay the groundwork for a general theory of non-equilibrium quantum systems, paving the way for practical applications that capitalize on staying quantum for prolonged timescales.",

The project's central objective is to explore and characterize the universal properties and dynamics of non-ergodic phases, which maintain quantum coherence over extended periods, thus resisting thermal equilibrium.

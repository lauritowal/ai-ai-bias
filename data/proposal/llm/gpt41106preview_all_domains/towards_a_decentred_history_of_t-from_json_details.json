        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for \"Towards a decentred history of the Middle East: Transborder spaces, circulations, frontier effects and state formation, 1920-1946,\" a pioneering research project aimed at recontextualizing the history of state formation in the Middle East post-World War I. The project encompasses a socio-historical analysis covering the period from 1920 to 1946, with an emphasis on the geographical areas of Turkey, Iraq, and Syria, regions that have been central to the dynamics of border creation and state violence.\n\nThe primary objectives of this research are to critically analyze the socio-historical impacts of state violence within Middle Eastern borderlands; to shed light on the significant but often overlooked role border populations have played in the creation of history; to study the frontier effects on individual subjectivity as well as spatial and temporal perceptions; and to provide a historical perspective that informs current conflicts in Syria and Iraq, offering potential pathways for conflict resolution.\n\nEmploying a multi-layered approach that includes macro, meso, and micro levels of study, the project will analyze trans-border phenomena such as the circulation of people, goods, and ideas, and the interactions between local actors and state representatives. This will be achieved through the examination of a variety of source materials, including diplomatic, administrative, and military records, as well as missionary documents and newspapers.\n\nBy conceptualizing borderlands as a 'histoire-problème' and exploring the co-production of borders between the state and society, this research aspires to develop a holistic and finely-grained understanding of territorial state formation in the Middle East. It aims to challenge and decentralize traditional narratives, offering fresh insights into the historical processes that have shaped the region's contemporary political landscape.",
        "Abstract:\n\nProposal Name: Towards a Decentred History of the Middle East: Transborder Spaces, Circulations, Frontier Effects, and State Formation, 1920-1946\n\nThis grant proposal seeks funding for a groundbreaking historical study aimed at reinterpreting the formation of the post-Ottoman Middle East from 1920 to 1946, with a focus on the borderlands of Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. The project challenges conventional, state-centered narratives by exploring the co-production of borders and examining the integral role border populations played in the making of history.\n\nThe objectives of this research are fourfold: to engage in a socio-historical analysis of state violence in Middle East borderlands; to scrutinize the participation of border populations in historical processes; to investigate the frontier effects on individual subjectivity, spatial organization, and temporal perceptions; and to provide a historical perspective that informs the understanding of current conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The approach is multidimensional, incorporating macro, meso, and micro-level studies. It employs a 'histoire-problème' framework, which views borderlands not just as geographical entities but also as epistemological notions that challenge traditional historical narratives.\n\nOur methodology includes a thorough analysis of various historical documents, such as diplomatic, administrative, and military records, missionary documents, and newspapers, allowing for a holistic and finely-grained understanding of the period in question. The research themes—transborder spaces, circulations, frontier effects, and state formation—interweave to produce a complex picture of the socio-political landscape that shaped the modern Middle East.\n\nThe project's innovative approach of analyzing trans-border phenomena and interactions between local actors and state representatives aims to offer a decentred history that contributes to current academic discourses on border studies and state-society relations. By elucidating the historical background of contemporary conflicts, the project also hopes to provide valuable insights for conflict resolution and peace-building efforts in the region.\n\nWith its comprehensive and interdisciplinary perspective, this study promises to reshape the understanding of Middle Eastern history and offer a new lens through which to view current geopolitical dynamics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, titled \"Towards a decentred history of the Middle East: Transborder spaces, circulations, frontier effects and state formation, 1920-1946,\" seeks to revolutionize the understanding of the Middle Eastern history by focusing on the critical period between 1920 and 1946. This study will concentrate on the regions of Turkey, Iraq, and Syria, areas that have been pivotal in shaping the modern Middle East but are often studied in isolation due to contemporary national borders.\n\nThe project aims to conduct a comprehensive socio-historical analysis of state violence in Middle Eastern borderlands, to elucidate the significant role border populations played in the creation of history, to examine the frontier effects on subjectivity, space, and time, and to provide a historical perspective on current conflicts in Syria and Iraq. By employing a multifaceted approach, which includes the analysis of trans-border phenomena, circulation of people, goods, and ideas, as well as interactions between local actors and state representatives, the research endeavors to uncover the complex dynamics of state formation in a post-Ottoman context.\n\nA diverse array of source materials will be utilized, including diplomatic, administrative, and military records, missionary documents, and newspapers. These will be analyzed at macro, meso, and micro levels to gain a holistic and finely-grained understanding of the co-production of borders between state and society. The project's epistemological framework is underpinned by the concept of borderlands as 'histoire-problème', which treats border areas not as peripheries but as central to the historical narrative.\n\nBy decentering the history of the Middle East and giving voice to the borderland experiences, this research aims to offer a novel perspective on how transborder spaces and circulations have shaped both historical and contemporary socio-political landscapes. The outcomes of this study are expected to contribute significantly to the academic discourse on border studies and provide valuable insights for resolving the current conflicts in the region.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"Towards a decentred history of the Middle East: Transborder spaces, circulations, frontier effects, and state formation, 1920-1946,\" aims to reconstruct the socio-historical narrative of the Middle East’s state formation during the interwar period. This research will concentrate on the territories of Turkey, Iraq, and Syria, scrutinizing the period between 1920 and 1946—a transformative era following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. \n\nThe primary objectives are to conduct a socio-historical analysis of state violence in Middle East borderlands, to examine the role of border populations in the construction of historical narratives, to study the frontier effects on subjectivity, space, and time, and to offer a historical perspective on the current conflicts in Syria and Iraq. By focusing on transborder phenomena and the circulation of people, goods, and ideas, this project challenges the centralized narratives of state formation and offers a decentred view that encompasses the perspectives and agency of borderland populations.\n\nThe research will deploy a multi-level approach, examining macro, meso, and micro historical developments. Methodologically, it will involve the analysis of diverse historical documents, including diplomatic, administrative, and military records, missionary documents, and newspapers. These sources will illuminate the co-production of borders between states and societies and the 'histoire-problème' of borderlands. The project's epistemological underpinnings consider borderlands as dynamic spaces where the interactions between local actors and state representatives shape the historical and social landscape.\n\nBy providing a holistic and finely-grained understanding of territorial state formation in the post-First World War Middle East, this research will not only contribute to historical knowledge but also offer valuable insight for contemporary conflict resolution and policy-making in the region.\n\nKeywords: Middle East history, borderlands, state formation, transborder spaces, interwar period, socio-historical analysis."

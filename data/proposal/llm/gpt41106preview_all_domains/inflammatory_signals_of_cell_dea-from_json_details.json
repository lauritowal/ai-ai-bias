        "Abstract:\n\nProject Title: Inflammatory Signals of Cell Death\n\nThe FIREALARM project seeks to elucidate the physiological origins of inflammation through a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach. Our central hypothesis posits that endogenous intercellular signaling proteins are pivotal in the transition from regulated inflammation to sterile, chronic inflammatory states. To investigate this, we have designed a research program incorporating system-wide, organismal, cell biological, and molecular methodologies.\n\nOur objectives are to determine the paracrine activities of pyroptosis, identify inflammatory signals both in vitro and in vivo, deepen our molecular and organismal understanding of intercellular circuits, develop strategies to revert chronic conditions, and stratify the molecular etiology and outcomes of patients suffering from sterile inflammatory diseases. To achieve these aims, we will employ innovative methods such as systematic iterative ablation of molecule release from dying cells, exploring perception pathways of sentinel cells, and leveraging cell type-specific mass spectrometry-based secretomics technologies.\n\nThe expected outcomes include a new level of understanding of the molecular language orchestrating communication networks between cells, the identification of signals that initiate, amplify, and resolve inflammation, and the discovery of novel inflammatory cell death markers. This work has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic metabolic and age-related disorders and to pave the way for new therapeutic strategies to treat these conditions. By addressing these fundamental questions, FIREALARM aims to make a significant impact on the field of sterile inflammation and chronic disease management.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe FIREALARM project seeks to elucidate the physiological origins of sterile inflammation and its progression to chronic, non-resolving states, a central issue in understanding chronic metabolic and age-related disorders. The pivotal hypothesis posited in this research is that endogenous intercellular signaling proteins, particularly during cell death processes like pyroptosis, are key drivers of sterile inflammation, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to chronic disease states.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, FIREALARM will leverage a comprehensive set of research methods, including system-wide analysis, organismal, cell biological, and molecular approaches. The project will employ systematic iterative ablation of molecule release from dying cells, investigate perception pathways of sentinel cells, and utilize cell type-specific mass spectrometry-based secretomics technologies. These methods will facilitate the identification of inflammatory signals both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nThe objectives of FIREALARM are to determine the paracrine activities of pyroptosis, identify inflammatory signals, understand intercellular circuits governing homeostasis, conceive strategies to revert chronic conditions, and stratify the molecular etiology and outcome of patients with sterile inflammatory diseases.\n\nExpected outcomes from FIREALARM include a new level of molecular and organismal understanding of intercellular circuits, recognition of signals initiating, amplifying, and resolving inflammation, and the discovery of emerging inflammatory cell death markers. This project promises to significantly advance the field by revealing the molecular language orchestrating communication networks between cells, and by providing strategies to address the pathogenesis of chronic metabolic and age-related disorders.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe FIREALARM project is a pioneering investigation into the physiological roots of inflammation, with a sharp focus on the role of endogenous intercellular signaling proteins in steering sterile inflammation and altering the balance of homeostatic conditions toward non-resolving chronic states. The central hypothesis posits that these signaling molecules are pivotal in triggering and perpetuating inflammation, thus playing a critical role in the onset of chronic metabolic and age-related disorders.\n\nTo explore this hypothesis, FIREALARM will employ a synergistic blend of system-wide, organismal, cell biological, and molecular analyses. Our multi-faceted approach includes the systematic iterative ablation of molecule release from dying cells, the study of perception pathways of sentinel cells, and the application of cell type-specific mass spectrometry-based secretomics technologies. The objectives are to determine the paracrine activities of pyroptosis, identify inflammatory signals both in vitro and in vivo, elucidate the molecular language orchestrating intercellular communication networks, and conceive actionable strategies to revert chronic inflammatory conditions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of FIREALARM include a new level of molecular and organismal understanding of intercellular circuits, the identification of signals that initiate, amplify, and resolve inflammation, and the discovery of novel inflammatory cell death markers. These findings will revolutionize our comprehension of sterile inflammation and offer novel insights into the pathogenesis of chronic metabolic and age-related disorders, facilitating the stratification of molecular etiology and outcome of patients affected by these conditions. The project promises to significantly advance our ability to diagnose, stratify, and treat sterile inflammatory diseases, thereby having a profound impact on public health.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe FIREALARM project seeks to elucidate the physiological origins of sterile inflammation, with a particular focus on how endogenous intercellular signaling proteins contribute to the transition from a homeostatic state to non-resolving chronic inflammatory conditions. This project integrates system-wide, organismal, cell biological, and molecular approaches to explore the intricate networks underlying inflammation. The central hypothesis posits that pyroptosis—a form of programmed cell death—is a key paracrine activity that releases signals leading to sterile inflammation in both metabolic and age-related disorders.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, the project will employ a range of innovative research methods, including systematic iterative ablation of molecule release from dying cells, perception pathways of sentinel cells, and cell type-specific mass spectrometry-based secretomics technologies. The objectives are to determine the paracrine activities of pyroptosis, identify inflammatory signals in vitro and in vivo, achieve a molecular and organismal understanding of intercellular circuits, conceive strategies to revert chronic conditions, and stratify the molecular etiology and outcomes of patients with sterile inflammatory diseases.\n\nExpected outcomes of the FIREALARM project include a new level of understanding of the molecular language orchestrating communication networks between cells, the recognition of signals initiating, amplifying, and resolving inflammation, and the identification of emerging inflammatory cell death markers. These findings will have a profound impact on our understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic metabolic and age-related disorders, potentially leading to novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

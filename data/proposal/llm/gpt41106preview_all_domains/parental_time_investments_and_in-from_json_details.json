        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal for the project \"PARENTAL TIME INVESTMENTS AND INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF INEQUALITY\" (PARENTIME) seeks to develop groundbreaking socio-economic theories to elucidate the mechanisms by which inequality is perpetuated across generations. Despite the recognition that parental time with children is crucial, current literature is limited by data constraints, narrow conceptualizations of parental time, and a focus on a restricted set of child outcomes. PARENTIME aims to close these gaps by investigating not just the quantity, but the quality, timing, and sequence of parental time investments and their implications for child development and socio-economic mobility.\n\nEmploying a theoretically-informed Big Data approach, PARENTIME will link large-scale, representative 24-hour diary survey data of parental and child activities with administrative records to construct a comprehensive set of child human capital measures. These measures will track outcomes into adulthood, providing valuable insights into the long-term effects of parental time investments. The project will also explore the interconnections between family members, the role of co-presence and multi-tasking in child-rearing, and the instantaneous parental enjoyment derived from spending time with children.\n\nBy coordinating a scientific approach from micro-level behaviors to a macro understanding of socio-economic inequality reproduction, PARENTIME seeks to contribute significantly to the discourse on reducing inequality. The expected outcomes will offer policymakers, educators, and social scientists a deeper understanding of the intergenerational transmission of human capital, with the ultimate goal of informing interventions that promote greater equality and social mobility.\n\nKeywords: Intergenerational inequality, parental time investment, child human capital, socio-economic outcomes, Big Data.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project \"PARENTAL TIME INVESTMENTS AND INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF INEQUALITY\" (PARENTIME) seeks to develop and refine socio-economic theories that elucidate the intricate mechanisms responsible for the persistence of inequality across generations. Addressing critical limitations such as data constraints and narrow conceptualizations of parental time and child outcomes, PARENTIME aims to extend the current understanding of how parental time investments contribute to the intergenerational transmission of human capital.\n\nEmploying a theoretically-driven Big Data approach, the project will integrate large-scale representative 24-hour diary survey data that detail parental time allocation with comprehensive administrative data on child educational and socio-behavioral outcomes. This innovative methodological fusion will enable the exploration of the timing and sequence of parental time investment, the co-presence in children's activities, the multi-tasking aspects of child-rearing, and the instantaneous enjoyment parents derive from spending time with their children.\n\nBy analyzing these dimensions, PARENTIME intends to reveal the long-term effects of parental time investments on a comprehensive set of child human capital measures, extending into the child's adult life. The project's goals are to explore family interconnections, establish the enduring impact of parental time on children's futures, and construct a coordinated scientific approach spanning from micro-level interactions to macro-level patterns of socio-economic inequality reproduction.\n\nUltimately, PARENTIME strives to bridge the gap in the literature by offering an in-depth examination of the processes by which children of high socio-economic status parents often inherit similar status, thereby advancing the discourse on policy interventions aimed at mitigating intergenerational inequality.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Parental Time Investments and Intergenerational Transmission of Inequality\" project, PARENTIME, seeks to develop groundbreaking socio-economic theories that elucidate the mechanisms by which inequality is perpetuated across generations. Addressing the limitations of data constraints and narrow theoretical traditions, this research will extend beyond mere quantification of parental time to explore its quality, timing, and sequence, as well as the immediate enjoyment parents derive from child-rearing activities. PARENTIME will utilize a theoretically-driven Big Data approach, linking robust 24-hour diary survey data with administrative records, to produce a comprehensive picture of family dynamics and their impact on child development.\n\nOur objectives include the exploration of the interconnections between family members, the establishment of the long-term effects of parental time investments, and the coordination of a scientific approach that scales from micro-level interactions to a macro understanding of socio-economic inequality reproduction. The project will investigate the role of parental co-presence, multi-tasking during child-rearing, and the timing of these activities to determine their influence on a comprehensive set of child human capital measures, tracking the effects into adulthood. \n\nPARENTIME aims to close the gap in our understanding of the complex ways in which high socio-economic status parents produce high socio-economic status children, thereby informing policies and interventions designed to mitigate inequality and foster social mobility. The proposed research has the potential to transform our knowledge of familial contributions to social inequality and guide future socio-economic frameworks and legislative measures to promote equity.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: PARENTAL TIME INVESTMENTS AND INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF INEQUALITY\n\nThe project PARENTIME seeks to address critical gaps in our understanding of the intergenerational transmission of inequality by focusing on the nuanced aspects of parental time investments and their long-term effects on child outcomes. Despite considerable research, the mechanisms through which parental time shapes the socio-economic trajectory of children remain insufficiently mapped, largely due to data limitations and narrow theoretical frameworks that have historically focused on the quantity of parental time without adequately considering its quality and context.\n\nThis proposal aims to develop innovative socio-economic theories that unravel the complex interaction between parental time investments and the subsequent development of human capital in children. Employing a theoretically-driven Big Data approach, PARENTIME will integrate large-scale, representative 24-hour diary survey data with comprehensive administrative datasets to analyze not just the amount, but the timing, sequence, and context of parental involvement in children's lives. The project will investigate the co-presence and multitasking during parent-child interactions, as well as the instantaneous enjoyment parents derive from child-rearing activities.\n\nBy capturing a comprehensive set of child human capital measures and tracing effects into adulthood, the research will explore how high socio-economic status parents give rise to children with similar status, thereby perpetuating cycles of inequality. The ultimate goal is to close the knowledge gap in literature by elucidating the mechanisms behind the intergenerational transmission of human capital, thus informing policies aimed at mitigating socio-economic disparities.\n\nPARENTIME promises to coordinate a scientific approach ranging from the micro-sequential level to a macro understanding of socio-economic inequality reproduction, contributing to a more equitable society by informing interventions that can disrupt the enduring patterns of inequality."

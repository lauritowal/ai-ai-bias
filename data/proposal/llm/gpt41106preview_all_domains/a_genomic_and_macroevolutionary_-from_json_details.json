        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"A Genomic and Macroevolutionary Approach to Studying Diversification in an Insect-Plant Arms Race,\" aims to dissect the intricate coevolutionary dynamics between herbivorous insects and plants. Utilizing the swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae) and their host plants as a model system, this multidisciplinary study will investigate the coevolutionary escape-and-radiate model that has potentially driven speciation and diversification.\n\nOur objectives are to construct a comprehensive species-level phylogeny for the Papilionidae family through whole-genome sequencing and to time-calibrate this phylogeny, integrating species traits to infer ancestral host-plant relationships and shifts. Concurrently, we will reconstruct dated phylogenies of the primary host-plant families to explore co-diversification patterns with their butterfly counterparts. We aim to estimate diversification rates within shifting/non-shifting and prey/non-prey clades and conduct a rigorous genomic survey to identify genes under positive selection that are related to host-plant shifts. Furthermore, we will characterize the transcriptomes of both caterpillars and their host plants, pinpointing genes involved in the ongoing arms race and comparing them across the swallowtail phylogenetic tree.\n\nExpected outcomes include: a complete species-level phylogeny for Papilionidae, detailed estimates of ancestral host-plant associations and shifts, dated phylogenies of host-plant families, diversification rate analyses for various clades, and the identification of positively selected genes and characterized transcriptomes that are central to the insect-plant arms race.\n\nThis research is significant because it will provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of ecological interactions over long evolutionary timescales and advance our understanding of macroevolutionary processes. The findings will have broader implications for the study of biodiversity, evolution, and the intricate relationships that shape the natural world.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines a multidisciplinary research project titled \"A Genomic and Macroevolutionary Approach to Studying Diversification in an Insect-Plant Arms Race.\" The primary research subject is the coevolutionary dynamics between herbivorous insects and plants, with a focus on swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae) and their various host-plant families. By examining the coevolutionary 'escape and radiate' model, the project aims to unravel the complexities of insect-plant interactions over evolutionary timescales.\n\nThe objectives of the project are multi-layered, aiming to develop a comprehensive macroevolutionary and genomic framework to study the origin and evolution of the insect-plant arms race. The project plans to construct a complete species-level phylogeny for Papilionidae using whole-genome sequencing and time-calibrated phylogenies of the main host-plant families. These phylogenies will be integrated with species traits to estimate ancestral host-plant preferences and shifts, thereby providing insights into the mechanisms behind coevolutionary diversification.\n\nAdditionally, the project proposes to estimate diversification rates across shifting/non-shifting and prey/non-prey clades, and to conduct a genomic survey to identify genes under positive selection that are related to host-plant shifts. The investigation will extend to characterizing the transcriptomes of caterpillars and their host plants to pinpoint genes involved in the arms race, comparing them across the swallowtail tree of life.\n\nExpected outcomes include a species-level phylogeny for Papilionidae, time-calibrated phylogenies with species traits, estimated ancestral host-plant preferences and shifts, diversification rates for different clades, and the identification of genes under positive selection. These outcomes will not only contribute to our understanding of the macroevolutionary consequences of host-plant shifts but will also provide answers to long-standing evolutionary questions regarding the mechanisms that drive ecological interactions over extended timescales.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Genomic and Macroevolutionary Approach to Studying Diversification in an Insect-Plant Arms Race\n\nThis project seeks to examine the coevolutionary dynamics of swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae) and their host plants, providing insight into the mechanisms of diversification within the context of an arms race. Employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates whole-genome sequencing, phylogenetic analyses, and transcriptomics, our goal is to construct a comprehensive species-level phylogeny for Papilionidae. Through time-calibration, we will estimate the ancestral host-plant preferences and document host-plant shifts, correlating these with diversification rates in shifting/non-shifting and prey/non-prey clades.\n\nThe proposed study will generate phylogenies of the primary host-plant families to evaluate their concurrent diversification with the butterflies. Genomic surveys will identify genes under positive selection that are associated with host-plant shifts. Furthermore, we will characterize the transcriptomes of caterpillars and their plants to pinpoint the genes driving the coevolutionary arms race, comparing these across the swallowtail lineage.\n\nExpected outcomes include a detailed species-level phylogeny of Papilionidae, time-calibrated phylogenies with species traits, ancestral host-plant preferences, host-plant shift estimates, dated phylogenies of main host-plant families, and diversification rates of various clades. Additionally, we anticipate the identification of positively selected genes and characterized transcriptomes that reveal the genetic basis of the insect-plant arms race.\n\nThis research is significant as it aims to answer fundamental evolutionary questions regarding the long-term ecological interactions between herbivorous insects and plants. By focusing on the escape and radiate coevolution model, the project will develop a macroevolutionary and genomic framework to study the origin and evolution of this arms race, offering a deeper understanding of biodiversity and the evolutionary processes that shape it.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"A Genomic and Macroevolutionary Approach to Studying Diversification in an Insect-Plant Arms Race,\" seeks to untangle the complex coevolutionary dynamics between herbivorous insects and plants within the framework of the escape-and-radiate model. Specifically, the project will focus on the Papilionidae family, commonly known as swallowtail butterflies, and their various host-plant families to understand the mechanisms that drive evolutionary change and diversification.\n\nThe project's objectives include constructing a complete species-level phylogeny for Papilionidae using whole-genome sequencing, calibrating this phylogeny with time, and combining it with species traits to estimate ancestral host-plant preferences and subsequent host-plant shifts. Additionally, we aim to recreate dated phylogenies of the main host-plant families to assess parallel diversification trends with the butterflies, estimate diversification rates in different evolutionary scenarios, and conduct a genomic survey to pinpoint genes under positive selection that are related to host-plant shifts. A pivotal aspect of our approach involves characterizing the transcriptomes of both caterpillars and their host plants to identify genes implicated in the evolutionary arms race, comparing these across the swallowtail phylogeny.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this multidisciplinary research include a comprehensive species-level phylogeny for Papilionidae, detailed reconstructions of host-plant family phylogenies, and diversification rate estimates for various clades. Furthermore, it will lead to the identification of genes under positive selection associated with host-plant shifts and a more precise understanding of the insect-plant arms race through characterized transcriptomes.\n\nOur research has the potential to answer critical evolutionary questions on the long-term mechanisms that underpin ecological interactions, providing valuable insights into the macroevolutionary patterns and processes that have shaped current biodiversity. Through this project, we aspire to develop a robust macroevolutionary and genomic framework that will significantly contribute to the study of coevolution and the origin and evolution of complex ecological relationships."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project titled \"Photosynthesis in far-red: from cyanobacteria to plants\" represents a groundbreaking effort to enhance agricultural productivity by optimizing photosynthetic efficiency in crops. Conventional photosynthesis utilizes the visible part of the solar spectrum (400-700 nm), but over 50% of available photons, particularly in the far-red region (>700 nm), are not harnessed, limiting the conversion of solar energy into biomass. This project challenges the long-standing belief that there is a 700 nm thermodynamic limit to oxygenic photosynthesis, inspired by the discovery of cyanobacteria species that thrive in far-red light environments.\n\nThe central goal of this research is to increase food production by improving the light-utilization efficiency of photosynthesis in crops. To achieve this, our project aims to first elucidate the mechanisms by which cyanobacteria acclimate to far-red light. We will then explore the feasibility of redesigning these mechanisms for integration into plant photosynthetic systems. Addressing knowledge gaps is crucial, such as the synthesis of novel pigments, their integration into photosynthetic proteins, the resultant impact on photochemical efficiency, and the overall regulation of photosynthesis.\n\nOur innovative approaches combine in vivo, in vitro, and in silico methodologies, utilizing cutting-edge techniques such as molecular biology, ultrafast spectroscopy, and modeling. This multidisciplinary approach is a hallmark of our research group, enabling us to comprehensively investigate the viability of introducing a far-red light response into plant systems and assess its potential benefits for crop enhancement.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project include a feasible strategy to extend the light absorption spectrum of crops, potentially increasing biomass conversion efficiency and contributing to enhanced food security. The implications of such advancements could be transformative, offering a sustainable solution to meet the growing global demand for food production.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Photosynthesis in far-red: from cyanobacteria to plants\n\nCurrent agricultural practices are challenged by the need to enhance food production to meet the demands of a growing global population. A primary constraint on crop yield is the efficiency of photosynthesis—the process by which plants convert solar energy into biomass. Photosynthetic systems in plants are currently limited to using the visible part of the solar spectrum (400-700 nm), leading to a discard rate of over 50% of the solar photons that could potentially be harnessed for biomass production. The discovery of cyanobacteria species that grow under far-red light (>700 nm) challenges the previously held belief of a 700 nm thermodynamic limit for oxygenic photosynthesis and presents an opportunity for advancing our understanding of photosynthetic efficiency.\n\nThis proposal seeks to investigate the potential of increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of plants by extending their light absorption capabilities to include far-red light. The project aims to elucidate the mechanisms of far-red light acclimation in cyanobacteria and to re-design these mechanisms for compatibility with plant photosynthetic systems. Our approach includes a combination of in vivo, in vitro, and in silico methodologies, utilizing molecular biology, ultrafast spectroscopy, and modeling techniques. By addressing knowledge gaps related to the synthesis of novel pigments, their integration into photosynthetic proteins, and the subsequent impact on photochemical efficiency and photosynthesis regulation, this project stands to redefine the boundaries of plant photosynthesis.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes include determining the viability of implementing a far-red light response in plants and assessing the potential benefits for crop enhancement. If successful, this strategy could lead to a paradigm shift in agricultural productivity and sustainability, representing a significant advancement in our quest to improve food security globally.",
        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Photosynthesis in far-red: from cyanobacteria to plants\"\n\nThe efficiency of photosynthesis in most crops is currently less than 1%, limited by their ability to utilize only the visible part of the solar spectrum (400-700 nm). Over 50% of the solar energy is discarded, predominantly in the form of far-red light (>700 nm), which is not absorbed by traditional photosynthetic pigments. Despite the previous belief that the thermodynamic limit for oxygenic photosynthesis is 700 nm, several species of cyanobacteria have been discovered growing under far-red light, challenging this assumption.\n\nThis proposal, \"Photosynthesis in far-red: from cyanobacteria to plants,\" aims to explore the untapped potential of far-red light (>700 nm)—which reaches the lower leaves of plants—to improve biomass conversion efficiency and meet the increasing demand for food production. The project will focus on two primary objectives: first, to elucidate the mechanisms of far-red light acclimation in cyanobacteria and, second, to re-design these mechanisms for compatibility with plant photosynthetic systems.\n\nThe research will address critical knowledge gaps, including the synthesis of novel pigments, their integration into photosynthetic proteins, and the subsequent impact on photochemical efficiency and photosynthesis regulation. An interdisciplinary approach, utilizing in vivo, in vitro, and in silico methodologies, will be employed, harnessing techniques such as molecular biology, ultrafast spectroscopy, and modeling—the group's trademark combination.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this research include not only determining the viability of a far-red response in plants but also assessing the benefits for crop enhancement, which could lead to significantly increased light-use efficiency. This strategy has the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices by enabling crops to convert more accessible solar energy into biomass, thus supporting the goal of improving photosynthesis for increased food production.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Photosynthesis in far-red: from cyanobacteria to plants\n\nGlobal food production faces the challenge of meeting the demands of a growing population under the constraints of limited arable land and climate change. The efficiency of photosynthesis in crops, currently less than 1%, plays a critical role in biomass production. A significant limitation is that plants only utilize the visible part of the solar spectrum (400-700 nm), resulting in over 50% of the solar photons being discarded. Recent discoveries of cyanobacteria species growing under far-red light (>700 nm)—beyond the previously accepted 700 nm thermodynamic limit of oxygenic photosynthesis—offer a promising avenue for enhancing crop photosynthesis by expanding the light absorption spectrum.\n\nThe proposed project, \"Photosynthesis in far-red: from cyanobacteria to plants,\" seeks to address the knowledge gaps related to the synthesis of novel pigments, their integration into photosynthetic proteins, the impact on photochemical efficiency, and the regulation of photosynthesis. The project aims to elucidate the mechanisms of far-red light acclimation in cyanobacteria and re-design these mechanisms for compatibility with plant photosynthetic systems.\n\nUtilizing a combination of in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches, and techniques such as molecular biology, ultrafast spectroscopy, and modeling—our research group's trademark—the feasibility of implementing a far-red response in plants will be determined, and the potential benefits for crop enhancement will be assessed.\n\nThe outcomes of this research may redefine the limits of photosynthetic efficiency and offer a novel strategy to increase light-use efficiency in crops. By extending the photosynthetic range into the far-red spectrum, this project has the potential to significantly impact global food production through the development of crops capable of harnessing a greater proportion of the solar spectrum.\n\nKeywords: Photosynthesis, Far-red light, Cyanobacteria, Crop enhancement, Biomass conversion efficiency."

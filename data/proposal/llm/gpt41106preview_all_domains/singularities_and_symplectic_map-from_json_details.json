        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Singularities and symplectic mapping class groups\" aims to deepen our understanding of symplectic topology, a rich and active field at the nexus of modern geometry and theoretical physics. Symplectic topology explores the structure of spaces equipped with a symplectic form—a non-degenerate, closed 2-form that defines a geometric framework for classical and quantum mechanics. Central to this proposal is the study of the symplectic mapping class group (SMCG), which captures the essence of automorphisms of a symplectic manifold. These groups play a crucial role in modern geometry, low-dimensional topology, representation theory, and the study of moduli spaces of algebraic varieties.\n\nDespite the pivotal position of the SMCG in these areas, our grasp of its higher-dimensional cases remains limited. This project endeavors to bridge this gap by focusing on SMCGs associated with smoothings of isolated singularities and their categorical analogs. The research is structured into four interconnected projects: (1) the complete characterization of SMCGs for Milnor fibres of simple elliptic and cusp singularities, (2) the examination of Stein varieties linked to two-variable singularities and quivers, (3) the description of categorical SMCGs of 'universal Milnor fibres,' and (4) the investigation into the dynamics of SMCGs.\n\nEmploying a multifaceted approach that integrates mirror symmetry, representation theory, singularity theory, geometric group theory, algebraic geometry, and homological stability, the research aims to combine various insights to study SMCGs and answer classical questions in singularity theory. This ambitious project not only seeks to advance theoretical knowledge but also to illuminate the profound connections between symplectic topology and other mathematical domains, such as classical and quantum mechanics. The outcomes of this research are poised to have significant implications for the broader mathematical community and contribute to our understanding of the underpinnings of physical theories.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Singularities and Symplectic Mapping Class Groups\n\nThe project \"Singularities and Symplectic Mapping Class Groups\" proposes a rigorous investigation within the field of symplectic topology, a branch of mathematics that plays a pivotal role in understanding the geometry of phase spaces in classical and quantum mechanics. This proposal aims to explore the group of isotopy classes of symplectomorphisms, known as the symplectic mapping class group (SMCG), which is fundamental in modern geometry and has profound implications across several mathematical disciplines including low-dimensional topology, representation theory, and the study of algebraic varieties' moduli spaces.\n\nOur focus is on automorphisms of symplectic manifolds, particularly, the SMCG and its relation to smoothings of isolated singularities, Milnor fibres, Stein varieties, and related categorical analogues. The project is structured around four key projects: (1) providing a complete description of SMCGs for Milnor fibres of simple elliptic and cusp singularities, (2) studying Stein varieties associated with two-variable singularities and quivers, (3) describing the categorical SMCGs of universal Milnor fibres, and (4) investigating the dynamics of SMCGs.\n\nThe research approach combines methodologies from mirror symmetry, representation theory, singularity theory, geometric group theory, algebraic geometry, and homological stability. These diverse theoretical frameworks will enable us to address classical questions in singularity theory and provide a deeper understanding of symplectic topology in both two-dimensional cases, correlating with classical mapping class groups, and higher dimensions where the understanding remains sparse.\n\nThe proposed research has the potential to yield significant advancements in our comprehension of SMCGs, impacting not only the study of symplectic manifolds but also enriching related areas such as classical and quantum mechanics. By combining various insights, this project aspires to unravel the complex nature of symplectic singularities and their automorphism groups, setting the stage for new breakthroughs in symplectic topology and its applications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Singularities and symplectic mapping class groups\" project is a comprehensive research effort situated at the intersection of symplectic topology and several other mathematical disciplines, including classical mechanics, low-dimensional topology, representation theory, the study of moduli spaces of algebraic varieties, and quantum mechanics. The core objective of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of the automorphisms of symplectic manifolds, specifically focusing on the symplectic mapping class group (SMCG). This entity is pivotal, as it connects the classical mapping class group in two dimensions with higher-dimensional counterparts, where knowledge remains sparse.\n\nThe research is structured around four innovative projects, each targeting a key aspect of SMCGs. These include: (1) a thorough investigation of the SMCGs for Milnor fibres of simple elliptic and cusp singularities; (2) an exploration of Stein varieties associated with two-variable singularities and quivers; (3) an analysis of the categorical SMCGs of universal Milnor fibres; and (4) an examination of the dynamics within SMCGs. Through these avenues, the project will combine insights from various theoretical frameworks—mirror symmetry, representation theory, singularity theory, geometric group theory, algebraic geometry, and homological stability—to elucidate the structural properties of SMCGs and tackle classical questions in singularity theory.\n\nUltimately, this proposal aims to integrate these diverse perspectives to yield a multifaceted understanding of SMCGs, informing and advancing the broader fields to which they are connected. The anticipated results promise to not only resolve longstanding questions in symplectic topology but also reveal profound implications for the related disciplines, impacting our comprehension of the fundamental mathematical structures that underpin both theoretical and applied sciences.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Singularities and symplectic mapping class groups,\" aims to delve into the uncharted waters of symplectic topology, particularly focusing on the symplectic mapping class group (SMCG), which is the group of isotopy classes of symplectomorphisms. SMCGs play a pivotal role in connecting various mathematical disciplines such as modern geometry, classical mechanics, low-dimensional topology, representation theory, algebraic varieties moduli spaces, and quantum mechanics.\n\nDespite its significance, the understanding of SMCGs in dimensions higher than two, where they correlate with the classical mapping class group, remains sparse. The project's primary objective is to bridge this gap by exploring the automorphisms of a symplectic manifold, with a focus on smoothings of isolated singularities. The project is structured into four key studies: the examination of Milnor fibres of simple elliptic and cusp singularities, the analysis of Stein varieties associated with two-variable singularities and quivers, the description of categorical SMCGs of \"universal Milnor fibres,\" and the investigation into the dynamics of SMCGs.\n\nOur research approach combines multiple methodologies, including mirror symmetry, representation theory, singularity theory, geometric group theory, algebraic geometry, and homological stability. By integrating these diverse theoretical frameworks, the project will not only advance our understanding of SMCGs but also provide new insights into the aforementioned mathematical disciplines.\n\nThe proposed research has the potential to answer classical questions in singularity theory and open new avenues for mathematical exploration.

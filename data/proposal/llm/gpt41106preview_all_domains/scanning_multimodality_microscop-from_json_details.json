        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Scanning multi-modality microscopy of moiré quantum matter,\" aims to revolutionize the imaging and analysis of moiré materials, which exhibit a wide range of complex and emergent phenomena. The centerpiece of this research is the development of a cutting-edge multi-modality nanoscale scanning probe, based on a hybrid superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) strategically placed on a tip. This tool will achieve record sensitivity, enabling the visualization and measurement of an array of physical properties—including currents, potentials, compressibility, magnetization, Berry curvature, topological invariants, superfluid density, temperature, thermal conductivity, dissipation, work, and noise—on a single sample under variable parameters such as extremely low temperatures, vector magnetic fields, carrier densities, displacement fields, and local potential perturbations.\n\nThe project will focus on an array of moiré materials, including magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, multilayer twisted van der Waals structures, and hybrid twisted van der Waals structures. These materials are at the frontier of modern condensed matter physics, presenting a diverse range of phenomena with many theoretical and experimental challenges.\n\nOur research goals are ambitious and diverse, aiming to provide nanoscale visualization and a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms governing various physical aspects such as topology, Berry curvature, orbital magnetism, superconducting order parameter, topological magnetic textures, and the intricacies of heat and charge transport, dissipation, and noise.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are groundbreaking, with the potential to provide deep insights into the multi-faceted physics of moiré materials. The proposed research is poised to address key open questions and elevate our comprehension of the fundamental principles that govern the rich and diverse physical phenomena observed in these advanced material systems.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"Scanning multi-modality microscopy of moiré quantum matter\" aims to revolutionize the understanding of moiré materials by developing a cutting-edge, multi-modality, nanoscale scanning probe. This probe, based on a hybrid superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) positioned on a tip, will be capable of imaging an array of physical properties—including currents, potentials, compressibility, magnetization, Berry curvature, topological invariants, superfluid density, temperature, thermal conductivity, dissipation, work, and noise—with unprecedented sensitivity on a single sample.\n\nThe focus of the study is on advancing the nanoscale visualization and comprehension of complex phenomena in moiré quantum matter. This encompasses materials beyond the well-explored magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and extends to multilayer and hybrid twisted van der Waals structures.

It seeks to elucidate the mechanisms governing topology, Berry curvature, orbital magnetism, superconducting order parameter, topological magnetic textures, as well as heat and charge transport, dissipation, and noise within these complex systems.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project are poised to deliver substantial advancements in our understanding of the physics of moiré quantum matter, offering the potential to uncover new states of matter and contribute to the development of innovative quantum devices.

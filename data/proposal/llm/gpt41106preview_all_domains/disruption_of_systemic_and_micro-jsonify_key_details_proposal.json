The corollary is lack of efficacy both in ostensibly responsive tumor types as well as others that are mostly non-responsive. The basis lies in pre-existing and adaptive resistance mechanisms that circumvent induction of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) capable of infiltrating solid tumors and eliminating cancer cells. A priori, cancers induced by expression of human papillomavirus oncogenes should be responsive to immunotherapy: these cancers encode immunogenic neo-antigens – the oncoproteins E6/7 – necessary for their manifestation. Rather, such tumors are poorly responsive to immunotherapies. Results from my lab and others using mouse models of HPV-induced cancer have established an actionable hypothesis: during tumorigenesis, such tumors erect multiple barriers to the induction, infiltration, and killing of cancer cells by tumor antigen-reactive CTLs. These include overarching systemic antigen-nonspecific immunosuppression mediated by expanded populations of myeloid cells in spleen and lymph nodes, complemented by immune response-impairing barriers operative in the tumor microenvironment. A spectrum of models will probe these barriers, genetically and pharmacologically, establishing their functional importance, alone and in concert. A major focus will be on how oncogene-expressing keratinocytes elicit a marked expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in spleen and lymph nodes, and how these myeloid cells in turn inhibit development and activation of CD8 T cells and antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Then we’ll assess the therapeutic potential of barrier-breaking strategies combined with immuno-stimulatory modalities. This project will deliver new knowledge about multi-faceted barriers to immunotherapy in these refractory cancers, helping lay the groundwork for efficacious immunotherapy."

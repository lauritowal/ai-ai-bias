        "Abstract\n\nTitle: An Anthropological Investigation of Muscular Politics in South Asia\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an ambitious project seeking to explore the increasing entanglement of criminal activities within political spheres across India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The project, which arises from a concern over the growing violence and criminal-political overlap in South Asia, aims to conduct a collaborative and cross-national ethnographic study that delves into the criminalization of politics in these countries.\n\nOur approach will involve local-level investigations, surveys, and historical analysis to create comprehensive political ethnographies in sixteen different sites. The research team consists of a principal investigator (PI) with significant experience in the cross-cultural study of democracy and muscular politics in the global South, and four postdoctoral researchers with expertise in ethnographic research, criminal politics, informal economies, and political violence. This combination of experience and knowledge is well-suited to address the complex issues at hand.\n\nThe objectives of this project are threefold: to develop a method for collaborative political ethnography; to generate policy-relevant research that can inform the work of international organizations and policy-making bodies; and to enhance capabilities by establishing an international network of scholars dedicated to understanding and addressing the challenges posed by muscular politics.\n\nExpected outcomes include the production of empirical material and theoretical directives that can steer further research in this area. By examining specific cases of embezzlement, burglary, kidnapping, and murder within the political context, this study will offer crucial insights into the workings of power and influence in South Asia. Through this investigation, we intend to provide the academic community with a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play and contribute to the development of more effective strategies for combating the intertwining of crime and politics in the region.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project entitled \"An Anthropological Investigation of Muscular Politics in South Asia\" aims to conduct a groundbreaking collaborative and cross-national ethnographic study to examine the increasingly concerning criminalization of politics in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This research focuses on the growing overlap between the criminal and political spheres, marked by alarming accusations of embezzlement, burglary, kidnapping, and murder, which highlight the urgent need for deep, empirical understanding and policy intervention.\n\nWith an approach that combines local-level investigations, surveys, and historical analysis, the project will produce sixteen comprehensive political ethnographies across the three countries. The objective is to develop a robust collaborative political ethnography method, generate policy-relevant research, and establish a network of international scholars that will enhance global academic capability in this field.\n\nThe research team, comprising a Principal Investigator (PI) and four postdoctoral researchers, brings to the table a wealth of expertise in ethnographic research, the study of criminal politics, informal economies, and political violence. This expertise is supported by the PI's previous research on the cross-cultural study of democracy and muscular politics in the global South, ensuring that the project is grounded in a strong theoretical foundation.\n\nBeneficiaries of this study will include policy-making bodies, international organizations, and the academic community, all of whom will gain from the empirical material and theoretical directives produced. This research promises to not only advance scholarly understanding of muscular politics in South Asia but also equip stakeholders with the knowledge required to address the intertwined issues of political violence and criminality in the region effectively.\n\nKeywords: South Asia, criminalization of politics, ethnography, political violence, policy research.",
        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: An Anthropological Investigation of Muscular Politics in South Asia\n\nThe proposed project, \"An Anthropological Investigation of Muscular Politics in South Asia,\" is a pioneering cross-national ethnographic study aimed at examining the burgeoning criminalisation of politics in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This research is motivated by the disturbing trend of increasing violence in politics and the growing overlap between criminal and political spheres, which has raised pressing concerns for governance, democracy, and social stability in the region.\n\nThe study is designed to conduct local-level investigations, deploy surveys, and engage in historical analysis to develop a collaborative political ethnography method. The project will provide a detailed, on-the-ground understanding of muscular politics, including instances of embezzlement, burglary, kidnapping, and murder related to political actors. This project plans to produce comprehensive political ethnographies in sixteen distinct sites across the three countries, offering empirical material and theoretical directives to inform further research and policy-making.\n\nOur team, consisting of a Principal Investigator (PI) and four postdoctoral researchers, brings a wealth of expertise in ethnographic research, criminal politics, informal economies, and political violence. This expertise is bolstered by the PI's previous research on democracy and muscular politics in the global South, ensuring a robust analytical framework for the study.\n\nThe research aims to generate policy-relevant research outcomes that can be utilized by policy-making bodies, international organisations, and the academic community to address and mitigate the challenges posed by the nexus of crime and politics. Additionally, it seeks to enhance scholarly capabilities by forging an international network of scholars dedicated to the study of political ethnography in South Asia.\n\nThis project's success will be measured by the production of sixteen political ethnographies, the generation of a comprehensive dataset, and the establishment of a strong scholarly network for continued collaboration and policy dialogue. The findings of this study will not only advance our theoretical understanding of muscular politics in South Asia but also provide actionable insights for stakeholders striving to promote transparent and accountable political processes in the region.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"An Anthropological Investigation of Muscular Politics in South Asia,\" addresses the critical issue of the entanglement between criminal activities and political arenas in South Asia, specifically in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This collaborative, cross-national ethnographic study seeks to delve into the increasing violence and criminal behaviors such as embezzlement, burglary, kidnapping, and murder within political contexts. The project aims to develop a robust political ethnography method that is both collaborative and policy-relevant, while also fostering an international network of scholars to enhance research capabilities.\n\nThe approach includes a local-level investigation combined with surveys and historical analysis within sixteen different political ethnographies sites across the three countries. The research team, composed of a principal investigator (PI) and four postdoctoral researchers, brings together expertise in ethnographic research, criminal politics, informal economies, and political violence. This expertise is underpinned by the PI's previous research on the cross-cultural study of democracy and muscular politics in the global South.\n\nOutcomes of the project are expected to be multifaceted, contributing comprehensive political ethnographies that offer empirical material and theoretical directives for further research. This will be beneficial to policy-making bodies, international organizations, and the academic community, providing insights and evidence to inform interventions and strategies to address the criminal-political nexus. Ultimately, the project aims to illuminate the complexities of muscular politics in South Asia and equip stakeholders with the knowledge to foster more transparent and accountable political environments.\n\nKeywords: Muscular politics, South Asia, Ethnography, Political violence, Criminalization of politics, Collaborative research, Policy development."

        "Abstract for Grant Proposal: \"Towards Compressive Information Processing Systems\"\n\nThe advent of digital technology has led to a deluge of data, presenting challenges in managing communication, storage, and processing resources. \"Towards Compressive Information Processing Systems\" is a pioneering research project that addresses these challenges by leveraging the principles of compressive sampling (CS) within complex information processing systems. CS is an innovative technique that acquires information signals through a minimal set of linear projections, enabling significant reductions in the requirements for communication, storage, and processing.\n\nOur project aims to develop a theoretical foundation and algorithms that will allow for efficient signal manipulations, including compression, encryption, communication, reconstruction, signal analysis, information extraction, decision-making, and distributed signal processing, directly on linear measurements without necessitating full signal sample reconstruction, which is often complex and resource-intensive. By focusing on applications such as multiview video, medical imaging, and hyperspectral imaging, the project will have a direct impact on enhancing the capabilities of European industries in communications and signal processing.\n\nThe research proposed herein seeks to develop fundamental tools that will power next-generation information processing systems. With the goal of achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in system performance at a lower cost, the project has the potential to revolutionize the way information is handled and processed. The integration of this new technology will underscore the regional importance of the research and its innovation dependency, positioning Europe at the forefront of the communications and signal processing sectors.\n\nIn conclusion, this grant proposal encapsulates a transformative approach to information processing that promises to meet the demands of the digital era with efficiency and innovation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Towards Compressive Information Processing Systems\" aims to revolutionize the field of compressive sampling (CS) by addressing the critical need to manage the soaring volumes of data with limited communication and computational resources. Our objective is to integrate CS into complex information processing systems, directly impacting applications such as multiview video, medical imaging, and hyperspectral imaging.\n\nAt the heart of our project lies the core concept of acquiring and manipulating information signals through a small set of linear projections, bypassing the need for traditional sample reconstruction due to its prohibitive complexity. This innovative approach promises to dramatically reduce communication, storage, and processing requirements, thus facilitating an order-of-magnitude performance improvement at a reduced cost.\n\nOur research will delve into the development of theoretical foundations and algorithms that permit efficient signal operations—compression, encryption, communication, reconstruction, signal analysis, information extraction, decision-making, and distributed signal processing—directly on these linear measurements. By doing so, we aim to create fundamental tools for next-generation information systems that can operate under resource constraints.\n\nThe implications of this research are profound for European industries specializing in communications and signal processing. The successful integration of this new technology into existing systems will not only solidify Europe's competitive edge in these sectors but also pave the way for innovation across a variety of fields where efficient information processing is crucial.\n\nIn summary, our proposal sets forth an ambitious and transformative research agenda that seeks to address some of the most pressing challenges in information processing through the lens of compressive sampling, with the potential to significantly benefit both European industries and the broader scientific community.",

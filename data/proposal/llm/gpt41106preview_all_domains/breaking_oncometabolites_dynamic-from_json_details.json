        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Breaking oncometabolites dynamics for next-generation dendritic cells tumor immunotherapy\" aims to revolutionize the field of cancer immunotherapy by addressing the challenge of the immunosuppressive Tumor MicroEnvironment (TME). Recognizing the critical role of metabolic changes within the host's immune cells, this proposal focuses on the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a pivotal sensor of the TME that influences the immune system's ability to combat tumors. \n\nWe hypothesize that AhR expressed in immune cells, particularly antigen-presenting cells (APCs), modulates the immune response to neoplastic cells. Our objectives are to identify AhR-activating metabolites within the TME and to understand their impact on tumor rejection or progression. Moreover, we aim to develop innovative strategies to inhibit AhR or its dependent programs in APCs, thereby mitigating the dampening effect of oncometabolites on immune responses.\n\nEmploying state-of-the-art technologies, including advanced single-cell analysis, promoter gene-editing techniques, and computational chemistry, our research will provide insights into the metabolites as potential predictors of immune activation or suppression. These metabolites are poised to serve as druggable targets to inhibit tumor escape mechanisms. A key aspect of our innovative approach is the selective deletion of AhR in APCs, which has been shown to trigger rejection of fibrosarcoma tumors in vivo.\n\nThe potential impact of this research is profound, offering a new paradigm for enhancing antitumor immune responses and overcoming therapy resistance. The translatability of our findings to human cells promises significant advancements in the treatment of neoplasia through the manipulation of oncometabolite biology. This could lead to the development of next-generation dendritic cell-based immunotherapies, offering hope for improved patient outcomes in the battle against cancer.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Breaking oncometabolites dynamics for next-generation dendritic cells tumor immunotherapy,\" aims to revolutionize the field of immunotherapy in neoplasia by addressing the complex interactions within the Tumor MicroEnvironment (TME). Recognizing the importance of metabolic changes in the host's immune cells, this research seeks to enhance the antitumor immune response, thereby circumventing therapy resistance.\n\nOur central hypothesis posits that the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) expressed in immune cells acts as a critical sensor of the TME, dictating the ultimate outcomes of immune reactions against tumors. Our objectives are threefold: to identify AhR-activating metabolites in the TME, to assess their impact on tumor rejection or progression, and to develop innovative strategies to inhibit AhR or AhR-dependent programs in antigen presenting cells (APCs).\n\nEmploying state-of-the-art technology, including advanced single-cell analysis, promoter gene-editing approaches, and computational chemistry, we aim to elucidate the role of AhR in immune cell and TME communication. The proposed research will utilize selective AhR deletion in APCs to investigate the consequent effects on tumor rejection, using fibrosarcoma tumors in vivo as a model.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this study are significant, with oncometabolites serving as predictors of immune activation or suppression in the TME. This could lead to the identification of novel druggable targets to inhibit tumor escape mechanisms, with a high degree of translatability to human cells. Our innovative approach to manipulating oncometabolite biology promises to not only strengthen antitumor immune responses but also to overcome the current limitations of therapy resistance, paving the way for next-generation immunotherapeutics in cancer treatment.",
        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Breaking Oncometabolites Dynamics for Next-Generation Dendritic Cells Tumor Immunotherapy\n\nThis grant proposal outlines an innovative research project targeting the challenge of immunotherapy resistance in neoplasia by manipulating the tumor microenvironment (TME). The primary focus is to unravel the immune intricacies within the TME, specifically the role of oncometabolites that alter the metabolic state of the host's immune cells and dampen the antitumor immune response. Our hypothesis posits that the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) is a pivotal sensor within TME that influences the outcomes of immune reactions against tumors.\n\nOur objectives include identifying AhR-activating metabolites within the TME, assessing their impact on tumor rejection or progression, and developing strategies to inhibit AhR or AhR-dependent signaling pathways in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). To achieve these, we will employ a multifaceted approach involving selective AhR deletion in APCs, advanced single-cell analysis, cutting-edge promoter gene-editing techniques, and computational chemistry. This combination of state-of-the-art technologies is expected to yield significant insights into the metabolites as potential predictors of immune activation or suppression in the TME and to identify novel druggable targets to prevent tumor escape mechanisms.\n\nThe proposed project is highly translational, with the potential to significantly impact the development of next-generation dendritic cell-based tumor immunotherapies. Through the manipulation of oncometabolite biology, we aim to enhance the antitumor immune response and overcome therapy resistance. The outcomes of this research could revolutionize the way we approach cancer immunotherapy, offering new, effective strategies for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Breaking Oncometabolites Dynamics for Next-Generation Dendritic Cells Tumor Immunotherapy\n\nThe proposed research project seeks to revolutionize the field of tumor immunotherapy by exploiting the intricate relationship between the Tumor MicroEnvironment (TME) and immune cell metabolism. Our focus is on the role of oncometabolitesâ€”the metabolic by-products that can dampen antitumor immune responses and contribute to therapy resistance. Central to our hypothesis is the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a pivotal sensor within immune cells that influences the outcome of immune reactions against tumors by interacting with metabolites in the TME.\n\nWe aim to identify AhR-activating metabolites and investigate their impact on tumor rejection or progression. Our objectives are to decipher the TME's communication with immune cells via AhR and to develop innovative strategies to inhibit AhR or AhR-dependent programs in dendritic cells, a class of antigen presenting cells (APCs) crucial for inducing tumor-specific immune responses. By selectively deleting AhR in APCs, we anticipate triggering the rejection of aggressive tumors such as fibrosarcoma.\n\nEmploying state-of-the-art technologies, including advanced single-cell analysis, promoter gene-editing approaches, and computational chemistry, this research will provide insights into metabolites as potential predictors of immune activation or suppression within the TME. Furthermore, we plan to identify and target immune suppressive oncometabolites as druggable targets to inhibit tumor escape mechanisms, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention.\n\nThe potential outcomes of this study are profound, with the promise of metabolites serving not only as biomarkers but also as novel targets for immunotherapeutic strategies. With a high degree of translatability to human cells, our research stands to significantly impact the development of next-generation immunotherapies, offering hope for patients facing tumors that are currently resistant to conventional treatments."

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Gene Expression Level as a Keystone to Understanding Gene Duplication: Evolutionary Constraints, Opportunities, and Disease\n\nGene duplications are pivotal in shaping the genetic architecture of organisms, potentially leading to evolutionary innovation and contributing to disease. This proposal aims to dissect the intricate relationship between gene duplication and expression levels, challenging the conventional wisdom that duplication merely relieves selective constraints or that all duplicates are functionally equivalent. We hypothesize that gene expression levels provide a critical resolution that can explain the contrasting evolutionary trajectories of gene-by-gene duplications versus whole-genome duplications (WGD), as well as their distinct roles in disease pathogenesis.\n\nOur research approach will employ computational and statistical analysis of high-quality genomics data to unravel the complex dynamics of gene duplication. We propose to test a model in which the indirect costs of gene expression are a major determinant of the outcome of gene duplication. By doing so, we aim to reveal the relationship between gene duplication and expression, explore the effects on gene and genome evolution, and link the patterns of gene expression and duplicability to pathogenic effects. Additionally, we aim to demonstrate that co-evolution of gene expression post-WGD fosters the evolution of new biochemical pathways and protein complexes, while also establishing a common mechanism of pathogenicity for many duplication events, independent of the biochemical function of the encoded genes.\n\nThe availability of abundant high-quality genomics data presents an unprecedented opportunity to address these questions. The projectâ€™s findings are expected to have significant implications for understanding evolutionary constraints and opportunities in the context of gene duplication, as well as for elucidating the common mechanisms underlying the pathogenic effects of gene duplications across a broad range of diseases. This research has the potential to redefine our perceptions of genetic redundancy, essentiality, and the evolutionary significance of gene duplications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Gene expression level as a keystone to understanding gene duplication: evolutionary constraints, opportunities, and disease,\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of gene duplication by exploring the intricate relationships between gene expression levels, evolutionary outcomes, and their role in disease. Contrary to previous assumptions that gene duplication relieves selective constraints and that gene knockouts are neutral due to redundancy, this research proposes that the constraints imposed by gene expression levels drive the evolutionary trajectories of duplicated genes.\n\nThe proposal challenges the notion that \"a duplicate is a duplicate,\" revealing that gene duplication is a biased process. While non-essential genes tend to duplicate and evolve rapidly, genes retained after whole genome duplication (WGD) are crucial and evolve more slowly. Through computational and statistical analysis of high-quality genomics data, the project aims to test the hypothesis that indirect costs of gene expression are a major determinant of the outcome of gene duplication. The research will reveal the relationship between gene duplication and expression, explore the effects of duplication on gene and genome evolution, and link patterns of gene expression and duplicability to pathogenic effects.\n\nAdditionally, the proposal posits that gene-by-gene duplications and WGD lead to distinct evolutionary paths, with WGD potentially facilitating the co-evolution of gene expression and the emergence of novel biochemical pathways and protein complexes. Furthermore, it suggests a common mechanism of pathogenicity across many duplication events, independent of the biochemical function of the encoded genes.\n\nThis groundbreaking research stands to provide new insights into evolutionary novelty and disease, by demonstrating that gene expression resolution is key to understanding the contrasting evolutionary trajectories of duplicated genes. It builds upon the availability of abundant high-quality genomics data, which offers an unprecedented opportunity to challenge existing views and establish new paradigms in the field of genomics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Gene expression level as a keystone to understanding gene duplication: evolutionary constraints, opportunities, and disease\" seeks to elucidate the intricate relationship between gene duplication and gene expression levels, challenging longstanding assumptions in the field. Traditional views that gene duplication simply relieves selective pressure and that gene knockouts are neutral due to redundancy are being called into question by a growing body of evidence suggesting a more nuanced scenario. This proposal argues that the fate of duplicated genes is heavily influenced by the indirect costs of gene expression, which can lead to contrasting evolutionary trajectories for gene-by-gene duplications versus whole genome duplications (WGD).\n\nOur hypothesis posits that gene expression resolution can explain the divergent paths of duplicated genes, with gene-by-gene duplications resulting in different evolutionary outcomes compared to WGD. Post-WGD, there appears to be a co-evolution of gene expression, fostering the evolution of new biochemical pathways and protein complexes. Moreover, a common mechanism of pathogenicity has been identified across many duplication events, irrespective of the biochemical functions of the genes involved.\n\nThe objectives of this study are to reveal the intrinsic relationship between gene duplication and expression, test a model where indirect gene expression costs determine duplication outcomes, and explore the resultant effects on gene and genome evolution. Furthermore, the project aims to link patterns of gene expression and duplicability with pathogenic effects. The availability of abundant high-quality genomics data presents an unprecedented opportunity to undertake this research using computational and statistical analysis methods.\n\nBy challenging previous assumptions and proposing a novel model of gene expression constraints, this research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the roles of gene duplication in both evolutionary novelty and disease, establishing a new paradigm in genomic research.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Gene expression level as a keystone to understanding gene duplication: evolutionary constraints, opportunities, and disease,\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of the role of gene duplication in evolutionary biology and disease pathogenesis. The current paradigm, which assumes that gene duplication events relieve selective constraints and that redundant genes are neutral in function, is challenged by our proposal. We hypothesize that the resolution of gene expression levels is critical for explaining the contrasting evolutionary trajectories that result from gene-by-gene duplications and whole genome duplications (WGD).\n\nOur objectives include revealing the complex relationship between gene duplication and expression levels, testing a model where the indirect costs of gene expression are a major determinant of the outcome of gene duplication, exploring the effects on gene and genome evolution, and linking patterns of gene expression and duplicability to pathogenic effects. We propose a comprehensive computational and statistical analysis of high-quality genomics data to achieve these goals. \n\nThe project's significance lies in its potential to elucidate the biased nature of the duplication process, where non-essential genes are more likely to duplicate, and genes retained after WGD are typically important and slowly evolving. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate that co-evolution of gene expression post-WGD can lead to the evolution of new biochemical pathways and protein complexes, suggesting a common pathogenic mechanism for many duplication events, independent of the biochemical function of the encoded genes.\n\nBy challenging previous assumptions such as \"a duplicate is a duplicate is a duplicate\" and the notion of gene knockout neutrality due to redundancy, our research will provide novel insights into the importance of gene expression levels in shaping the evolutionary landscape and contributing to disease. The availability of abundant, high-quality genomics data presents an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of these critical biological processes."

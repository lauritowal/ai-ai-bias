        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Moduli of curves, sheaves, and K3 surfaces,\" aims to advance the field of algebraic geometry by exploring the rich structures and interconnections within moduli spaces, specifically focusing on curves, sheaves, and K3 surfaces. The project seeks to uncover deep relationships between these spaces and their implications in various branches of mathematics and theoretical physics, including number theory, representation theory, topology, and quantum field theory.\n\nThe central research goals of this proposal are multifaceted, targeting the algebra of tautological classes on moduli spaces of curves, the intricate structure of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of 3-folds, the analysis of Virasoro constraints, the modular properties of invariants of K3 surfaces, and the investigation of Noether-Lefschetz loci in the moduli of K3 surfaces. To achieve these objectives, the project will utilize a range of innovative methodologies such as virtual localization, degeneration, descendent methods, and log geometry, along with the development of new geometries including moduli spaces of stable quotients and stable pairs.\n\nThe significance of this research extends beyond the realm of pure mathematics, as it carries implications for string theory and provides a deeper understanding of classical algebraic geometry through the lens of modern techniques. By harnessing new geometries and innovative techniques, this project promises to offer substantial contributions to the study of moduli spaces, enhancing our comprehension of their mathematical properties and fostering further discoveries in related fields.",

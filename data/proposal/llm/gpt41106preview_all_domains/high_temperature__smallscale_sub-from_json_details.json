        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research, titled \"High Temperature – Small-Scale Sub-Surface Deformation assisted by Oxidation,\" seeks to unravel the complex interplay between thermal, mechanical, and chemical phenomena that lead to early damage in materials exposed to extreme environments. Focused on Ni-based and Ti-based alloys, the project aims to assess local deformation at the sub-grain scale under high temperatures ranging from 650°C to 1200°C, with particular attention to oxidation effects that induce depth gradients from 0.1 to 100 µm.\n\nThis ambitious investigation will leverage a suite of cutting-edge techniques, including high-resolution digital image correlation (HR-DIC), in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing, in-situ micropillar/nanoindentation testing, synchrotron nano-tomography, and topotomography. Furthermore, the project will develop novel mesoscale flexural techniques with real-time 3D observation capabilities up to 1000°C to accurately characterize material behavior under these challenging conditions.\n\nTo complement experimental approaches, the project will employ advanced numerical simulations, such as phase field-coupled crystal plasticity finite element methods, to gain deeper insight into the graded properties of materials at both the microscale and macroscale. Addressing measurement challenges, such as robust sub-surface behavior assessment during oxidation and monitoring of surface texture evolution, the team will implement smart surface monitoring for HR-DIC and inverse numerical methods.\n\nOverall, this research will significantly enhance our understanding of the mesoscale mechanisms driving early damage in high-temperature environments. The outcomes promise to inform the design of more resilient materials capable of withstanding the severe conditions encountered in aerospace, energy, and automotive applications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"High Temperature – Small-Scale Sub-Surface Deformation assisted by Oxidation\", seeks funding to explore the intricate phenomena of sub-grain scale deformation under high-temperature conditions, specifically ranging from 650°C to 1200°C, and how it is influenced by oxidation processes with depth gradients between 0.1 µm and 100 µm. The research will primarily focus on Ni-based and Ti-based materials, known for their critical applications in high-temperature environments. \n\nInnovative experimental techniques, such as high-resolution digital image correlation (HR-DIC), in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing, in-situ micropillar/nanoindentation testing, synchrotron nano-tomography, and topotomography, will be employed. These will be complemented by advanced numerical simulations, including phase field-coupled crystal plasticity finite element methods. Additionally, the development of novel mesoscale flexural techniques capable of real-time 3D observation up to 1000°C will be undertaken to enhance the understanding of material behavior at these elevated temperatures.\n\nKey challenges addressed in this project include ensuring robust measurements at sub-surface locations during oxidation and monitoring the evolution of surface texture. To tackle these challenges, the project proposes the use of smart surface monitoring tailored for high-temperature HR-DIC at the microscale and the application of inverse numerical methods.\n\nThe overarching goal of this research is to elucidate the coupling between surface reactivity and local deformations in materials subjected to harsh thermal environments. By achieving a deeper understanding of these mechano-chemical interactions, the project aims to significantly advance the field of material science, providing insights into early damage mechanisms that are pivotal for the development of more resilient materials in high-temperature applications.",

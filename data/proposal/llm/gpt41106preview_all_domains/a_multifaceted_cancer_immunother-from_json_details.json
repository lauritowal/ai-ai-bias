        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A multifaceted cancer immunotherapy based on an immune checkpoint-modulating chimeric oncolytic virus vector in combination with a dendritic cell vaccine\n\nDespite advances in cancer immunotherapy, the response to existing treatments, particularly for solid tumors such as Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains disappointing. This limitation is often due to the immune-suppressive microenvironment characteristic of these malignancies, particularly in the liver. Our proposal aims to address this challenge through the development of a novel, multifaceted approach that leverages the patient's immune system to fight cancer more effectively.\n\nWe propose a groundbreaking strategy that combines two promising therapeutic approaches: a novel chimeric oncolytic virus (OV) and a dendritic cell vaccine. Oncolytic viruses have shown capabilities in directly lysing tumor cells and stimulating immune responses against the tumor. However, their effectiveness as monotherapy is limited by the innate antiviral immune response. Our combination scheme, named the ONCO-VAX approach, intends to improve the intratumoral dissemination of the OV and exploit its immune-stimulatory capacity. The chimeric OV is engineered with enhanced cell-cell spreading capacity and optimized gene expression to eradicate the local immune-suppressive microenvironment within the tumor.\n\nIn conjunction with the OV, we will implement an additional therapy layer with a dendritic cell vaccine designed to initiate a broad antitumor response. This multimodal approach aims to achieve systemic and potentially life-long immunity against cancer, contributing an innovative step in the field of cancer immuno-oncology.\n\nThis project addresses a significant health concern and societal burden, with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of HCC and other solid tumors. The anticipated outcome is to establish a new standard for cancer immunotherapy, yielding synergistic responses even in metastatic disease and thereby improving patient outcomes significantly.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Multifaceted Cancer Immunotherapy Based on an Immune Checkpoint-Modulating Chimeric Oncolytic Virus Vector in Combination with a Dendritic Cell Vaccine\n\nCancer remains one of the most significant health concerns worldwide, with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exemplifying a challenging malignancy due to its immune-suppressive microenvironment, particularly in the liver. Current therapies for solid tumors, including HCC, yield disappointing response rates, with a subset of patients experiencing dramatic outcomes. Addressing this gap, our grant proposal outlines a novel, multifaceted approach in the field of cancer immunotherapy, leveraging the patient's immune system to combat cancer more effectively.\n\nOur proposed therapeutic strategy, dubbed the ONCO-VAX approach, is a combination therapy that integrates a novel chimeric oncolytic virus (OV) with a dendritic cell vaccine. The chimeric OV is engineered with enhanced cell-cell spreading capacity and optimized gene expression designed to eradicate the local immune-suppressive microenvironment within tumors. By leveraging the innate capabilities of OVs to induce tumor cell lysis and stimulate immune responses, our strategy aims to overcome the limitations posed by the innate antiviral immune response, which typically hampers OV effectiveness when used as monotherapy.\n\nThe additional layer of therapy, a dendritic cell vaccine, is intended to initiate a broad antitumor response, synergizing with the OV to enhance efficacy. Our goal is to achieve systemic and potentially life-long immunity against cancer, offering an innovative step in the progress of cancer immuno-oncology.\n\nThe societal burden of cancer, both epidemiological and financial, underscores the urgency for innovative treatments. Our ONCO-VAX aims to provide a groundbreaking and comprehensive therapeutic option, with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes for those afflicted with HCC and potentially other solid tumors. This research promises to open new avenues in cancer therapy, bringing hope and life-extending solutions to patients in dire need.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: A Multifaceted Cancer Immunotherapy Based on an Immune Checkpoint-Modulating Chimeric Oncolytic Virus Vector in Combination with a Dendritic Cell Vaccine\n\nCancer continues to pose a significant epidemiological and financial burden on society, with most solid tumors, including Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), showing disappointing response rates to current treatments. This proposal presents a novel approach in cancer immunotherapy, leveraging the patient's immune system to combat this challenging malignancy. Our project aims to develop an innovative strategy that incorporates a chimeric oncolytic virus (OV) with enhanced cell-cell spreading capacity, optimized for eradicating the immune-suppressive microenvironment characteristic of HCC in the liver.\n\nThe proposed ONCO-VAX approach is a combination therapy that seeks to exploit the direct tumor cell lysis and immune response stimulation capabilities of OVs while overcoming their limitations, such as the innate antiviral immune response that diminishes their efficacy. By integrating a dendritic cell vaccine with the chimeric OV, we aim to initiate a broad antitumor response that could lead to systemic and potentially life-long immunity against cancer.\n\nThis project represents a multimodal therapeutic approach that stands as an innovative step in cancer immuno-oncology. By addressing the specific challenges of HCC and capitalizing on the synergistic effects of the combined treatments, ONCO-VAX aims to generate significant advancements in the field and offer hope for patients with metastatic disease. The anticipated outcome is a paradigm shift in cancer therapy, providing a comprehensive and durable defense against cancer recurrence and metastasis, and thereby improving patient survival and quality of life.\n\nKeywords: Cancer Immunotherapy, Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Oncolytic Viruses, Dendritic Cell Vaccine, Immune Checkpoint, Chimeric Virus, Combination Therapy, Immune Microenvironment.",

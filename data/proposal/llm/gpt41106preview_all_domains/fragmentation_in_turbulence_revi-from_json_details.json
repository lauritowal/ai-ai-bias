        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project entitled \"Fragmentation in Turbulence Revisited - Toward a universal theory for turbulent emulsification\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of emulsification processes within turbulent flows, a phenomenon prevalent in both environmental and industrial contexts. By revisiting the foundational Kolmogorov-Hinze theory, the project seeks to establish a novel deterministic framework for predicting and characterizing the disintegration of droplets and bubbles in turbulent media.\n\nCentral to our objectives is the development of a universal theory for turbulent emulsification that transcends the limitations of current models, which are often constrained to specific cases or flow conditions. To achieve this, our approach integrates theoretical investigation with cutting-edge experimental characterization and sophisticated numerical simulation. We will employ advanced experimental techniques, such as tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and shape reconstruction, to capture the dynamics of emulsification with unprecedented detail. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) will be utilized to probe dense emulsifications and surfactant-laden environments, providing a comprehensive dataset for the development of a universal theory.\n\nA key innovation of this project is the novel description for the Hinze scale based on enstrophy transport, an aspect of turbulent flow that has not been fully explored in the context of emulsification. By measuring the spectral rate of enstrophy transport rates within laboratory settings and employing these insights in conjunction with DNS-generated data, we anticipate the formulation of a new, case-independent universal correlation for the Hinze scale.\n\nThe expected outcomes include not only a theoretical framework for sustained homogenous isotropic turbulent flows but also practical engineering applications, such as improved methods for atomization and emulsification processes. The FragTuRe project represents a significant leap toward a comprehensive understanding of turbulent emulsification, providing a foundation for innovations across various industries and environmental applications.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Fragmentation in Turbulence Revisited - Toward a Universal Theory for Turbulent Emulsification\n\nThe proposed research, Fragmentation in Turbulence Revisited (FragTuRe), aims to revolutionize the understanding of turbulent emulsification by developing a universal theory that transcends the limitations of the existing Kolmogorov-Hinze framework. The primary objective is to establish a novel, deterministic approach to the study of emulsification in turbulent, drop-laden, and bubbly flows, providing a case-independent correlation for the critical Hinze scale—a pivotal measure dictating the balance between turbulent breakup and coalescence in multiphase flows.\n\nEmploying a synergistic methodology comprising theoretical investigation, experimental characterization, and high-fidelity numerical simulation, FragTuRe intends to dissect the intricate enstrophy transport mechanisms that govern fragmentation processes. Cutting-edge experimental techniques, including tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and shape reconstruction, will work in tandem with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) to capture the dynamics of dense emulsifications and surfactant-laden environments.\n\nThe project is expected to yield a novel description of the Hinze scale, rooted in the spectral rates of enstrophy transport. The generation of a large, comprehensive dataset from simulations will underpin the formulation of a universal theory applicable to various engineering domains, such as atomization, emulsification, environmental, and industrial applications.\n\nThe FragTuRe project promises to deliver transformative insights and a new theoretical basis for sustained homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows, thereby addressing a fundamental gap in fluid dynamics. The anticipated outcomes include a novel universal correlation for the Hinze scale and improved predictive capabilities, which are critical for optimizing processes across a spectrum of engineering disciplines.\n\nKeywords: Turbulent Emulsification, Hinze Scale, Enstrophy Transport, Tomographic PIV, Direct Numerical Simulation, Universal Theory",
        "Title: Fragmentation in Turbulence Revisited - Toward a Universal Theory for Turbulent Emulsification\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe \"Fragmentation in Turbulence Revisited\" (FragTuRe) project seeks to pioneer a universal theory for turbulent emulsification, challenging and expanding upon the foundational Kolmogorov-Hinze framework. Our ambitious objective is to develop a novel deterministic approach to understand and predict the behavior of emulsions in turbulent flows, which is pivotal for numerous industrial and environmental applications.\n\nThrough a multi-faceted research strategy, we will integrate theoretical investigation, cutting-edge experimental characterization, and advanced numerical simulations. Innovatively applying concepts such as Hinze scale and enstrophy transport, we aim to achieve a groundbreaking description of the emulsification process. The project will leverage state-of-the-art experimental techniques, including Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and shape reconstruction strategies, as well as Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) to study dense emulsifications and surfactant-laden environments.\n\nThe anticipated novel description for the Hinze scale, grounded in enstrophy transport, will be substantiated through meticulous measurements of spectral rates of enstrophy transport. A substantial dataset from simulations will support the development of a universal theory applicable to both drop-laden and bubbly turbulent flows.\n\nThe expected outcomes of FragTuRe include not only a universal theory for emulsification but also a novel case-independent universal correlation for the Hinze scale. These results have the potential to significantly influence various sectors by enhancing processes such as atomization in combustion engines, emulsification in food and pharmaceuticals, and pollutant dispersion in environmental systems.\n\nThe FragTuRe project represents a transformative step towards a unified understanding of turbulent fragmentation, with the promise of wide-reaching implications across the engineering field. The universal correlation for the Hinze scale developed here is poised to become an essential tool for researchers and practitioners alike, facilitating the design and optimization of turbulent mixing and emulsification processes worldwide.",

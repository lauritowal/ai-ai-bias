        "Abstract:\n\nThe MiMETIC (Microwave Metadevices based on Electrically Tunable organic Ion-electron Conductors) project aims to revolutionize microwave technology through the development of a new generation of metadevices. These devices will be based on the unique properties of organic mixed ion-electron conductors (OMIECs), which allow for electrical reconfigurability. MiMETIC will lay the groundwork for electrically tunable microwave devices by investigating the fundamental microwave properties of OMIECs across the 1-100 GHz spectrum, a critical range for future wireless communication technologies, such as 5G and 6G.\n\nThe project's objectives are threefold: first, to extensively characterize OMIECs in the microwave range to validate their potential for reconfigurable applications; second, to utilize high-throughput deposition techniques to fabricate large-area, thin, and flexible reconfigurable metasurfaces; and third, to demonstrate the practical capabilities of these novel devices in various applications, including wireless communication and bioelectronic interfaces. MiMETIC envisions the creation of tunable metasurfaces for microwave optics, enhancing the pervasiveness and utility of metadevices in fields spanning from wireless communication to neuromorphic computing.\n\nThis project will produce innovative outcomes, such as the integration of organic electrochemical transistors with microwave technology, leading to significant advancements in printed electronics, energy harvesting, and organic bioelectronics. Furthermore, MiMETIC is poised to stimulate new interdisciplinary research, providing a platform for future exploration in distributed sensing, healthcare, and photonics. With its potential to reshape the landscape of microwave device technology, MiMETIC promises to establish a robust foundation for the next wave of wireless innovations and applications.",

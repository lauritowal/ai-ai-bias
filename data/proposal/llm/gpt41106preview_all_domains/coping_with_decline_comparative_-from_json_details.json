        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Coping with decline: Comparative social-historical analysis of depopulation and community welfare in Europe, 1950-2022\" (project name: DEPOP) aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the slow burn crisis of depopulation and its impact on community welfare across Europe. DEPOP seeks to document and analyze the signs of depopulation, including shrinking populations, school closures, and hospital closures, within rural and urban communities from 1950 to 2022. Utilizing a novel multi-level approach that incorporates compositional demography and the historical concept of communication communities, DEPOP will map demographic trajectories, link depopulation to welfare provision, and investigate community coping strategies.\n\nThe objectives of the project include creating a comparative framework that can be used to study community welfare during prolonged crises. Specifically, DEPOP will focus on three case study regions—Finland, the Netherlands, and Ukraine—to provide a varied perspective on the issue. The analysis will be conducted on three levels: macro (population trajectories and state welfare provision data), meso (collective coping strategies through social organizations), and micro (individual coping strategies through oral histories). Data sources for the project will include reports, regional statistics, archives, witness seminars, and oral histories.\n\nThe expected outcome of DEPOP is to advance the understanding of community resilience in the face of long-term demographic decline. The project's findings will offer a first-of-its-kind comparative framework that policymakers, social scientists, and historians can use to understand and respond to the challenges of depopulation. By documenting the lived experiences of affected individuals and communities, DEPOP will shed light on the adaptive mechanisms that emerge during slow burn crises and contribute to the formulation of strategies to mitigate their adverse effects on community welfare.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the research project \"Coping with Decline: Comparative Social-Historical Analysis of Depopulation and Community Welfare in Europe, 1950-2022\" (DEPOP), which aims to examine the phenomena of depopulation in European regions and its effects on community welfare. The project focuses on the signs of depopulation, such as shrinking populations, closure of schools, and closure of hospitals, and the resultant challenges faced by both rural and urban communities.\n\nThe primary objectives of DEPOP are to map the demographic trajectories and welfare provision links, investigate community coping strategies, and develop a comparative framework for understanding community welfare during the 'slow burn crisis' of depopulation. Employing a novel multi-level approach, DEPOP will analyze data across macro, meso, and micro levels. At the macro level, population trajectories and state welfare provision data will be examined, while at the meso level, collective coping strategies through social organizations will be analyzed. The micro-level will explore individual coping strategies through oral histories.\n\nThe project will apply methodologies including compositional demography and the historical concept of communication communities. Case studies from Finland, the Netherlands, and Ukraine will provide a diverse cross-section of affected regions. Data sources such as reports, regional statistics, archives, witness seminars, and oral histories will inform the research.\n\nDEPOP's historical approach and findings are anticipated to offer a first-of-its-kind comparative framework to study communities affected by the slow burn crisis of depopulation. The expected outcome is to advance the understanding of community resilience in slow burn crises and to provide insights into the sustainability of welfare provision in the face of demographic challenges. The project's impact will extend beyond academia, informing policymakers and community leaders in developing strategies to address the multifaceted consequences of depopulation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Coping with Decline: Comparative Social-Historical Analysis of Depopulation and Community Welfare in Europe, 1950-2022\" (DEPOP) is a pioneering research initiative that aims to analyze the phenomenon of depopulation in European communities and its implications for societal welfare. By examining the period from 1950 to 2022, DEPOP seeks to map demographic trajectories, explore the relationship between depopulation and welfare provision, and investigate community coping strategies in the face of a 'slow burn crisis.'\n\nDepopulation is evidenced by shrinking populations, the closure of schools and hospitals, and the impact is felt across both rural and urban communities. DEPOP will focus on case studies within three distinct European countries: Finland, the Netherlands, and Ukraine. Through a novel multi-level analytical approach incorporating compositional demography and the concept of communication communities, the project will dissect the crisis at macro, meso, and micro levels. These levels will respectively explore population trajectories and state welfare provision, collective coping strategies through social organizations, and individual coping mechanisms through oral histories.\n\nData collection will be extensive, drawing from reports, regional statistics, archives, witness seminars, and oral histories to construct a rich and nuanced dataset. The expected outcome of DEPOP is the development of a first-of-its-kind comparative framework that will enable the study of communities affected by the slow burn crisis of depopulation. This framework will not only advance understanding of demographic shifts and community welfare but will also shed light on community resilience and the efficacy of coping strategies during prolonged crises.\n\nDEPOP's comprehensive historical approach promises to deliver significant contributions to the fields of demography, social welfare, and crisis management, providing valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and community leaders grappling with the long-term challenges of demographic decline.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Coping with decline: Comparative social-historical analysis of depopulation and community welfare in Europe, 1950-2022\" (DEPOP) aims to address the critical issue of depopulation—a \"slow burn crisis\"—affecting various regions across Europe. This interdisciplinary research seeks to understand how communities confront and adapt to the challenges posed by shrinking populations, school and hospital closures, and the resultant strain on welfare provisions.\n\nDEPOP will focus on three case study regions—Finland, the Netherlands, and Ukraine—to map demographic trajectories and welfare provision links, investigate community coping strategies, and develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing community welfare during extended periods of decline. The project's novel multi-level approach will employ compositional demography and the historical concept of communication communities to dissect the issue at macro (population and state welfare data), meso (social organizations), and micro (individual experiences) levels.\n\nDrawing upon a rich array of data sources, including reports, regional statistics, archives, witness seminars, and oral histories, DEPOP will provide a historical perspective on current conditions. The project will reveal how rural and urban communities have historically navigated the complexity of depopulation and its implications for welfare, offering an unprecedented comparative framework to study such affected communities.\n\nThe expected outcome of DEPOP is to significantly advance our understanding of community resilience and inform policy-making for regions confronting similar slow burn crises in the future. By uncovering the coping mechanisms developed over more than seven decades, this research will contribute valuable insights into sustainable community welfare strategies in the face of demographic decline. The findings of DEPOP will enable stakeholders to better support affected communities, ensuring social cohesion and well-being amidst challenging demographic transitions."

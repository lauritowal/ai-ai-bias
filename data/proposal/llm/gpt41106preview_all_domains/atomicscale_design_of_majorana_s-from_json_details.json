        "Abstract:\n\nThe pursuit of quantum computation has ushered in a paradigm shift in condensed matter physics, with the Atomic-scale Design of Majorana states and their Innovative Real-space Exploration (ADMIRe) project poised at the forefront. This groundbreaking proposal aims to leverage the peculiar properties of zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS)—quasiparticles that are their own antiparticles—to enable fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. At the core of ADMIRe is the braiding of non-Abelian anyons, a theoretical concept that promises a leap in the manipulation of quantum information.\n\nADMIRe will focus on one-dimensional magnetic nanowires in proximity to s-wave superconductors under high spin-orbit coupling—a system thought to be a fertile ground for MBS. Utilizing an ultra-high vacuum environment, the project will deploy advanced experimental techniques, including STM-based atom manipulation, spin-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), scanning Josephson tunneling spectroscopy, and multi-probe STS. These methods will be employed to design and scrutinize artificially constructed single-atom chains, enabling the study of their magnetic state, spin-polarization, and the spatial nature of the superconducting order parameter.\n\nThe project's objectives are to observe the formation of Shiba bands, examine the emergence of MBS with respect to chain structure, length, and composition, and to construct model-type platforms (such as T-junctions, rings, and complex network structures) that are crucial for braiding experiments. The ultimate goal of ADMIRe is to directly probe the quantum exchange statistics of non-Abelian anyons, thereby providing empirical evidence for their existence and functionality.\n\nIf successful, ADMIRe will not only deepen our understanding of condensed matter physics but also pave the way for the development of topological quantum computers, revolutionizing the field of quantum technology.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Atomic-scale Design of Majorana states and their Innovative Real-space Exploration,\" aims to advance the field of condensed matter physics by investigating the properties and manipulation of zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) in the context of topological quantum computation. MBS are predicted to exist at the ends of one-dimensional magnetic nanowires in proximity to s-wave superconductors and are characterized by high spin-orbit coupling. These exotic quasiparticles are of great interest due to their non-Abelian statistics, which are essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n\nOur experimental approach involves the use of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to manipulate atoms and create single-atom chains with non-collinear spin-textures on elemental superconducting substrates. This setup will be maintained under ultra-high vacuum conditions to ensure precision and reproducibility. The formation of Shiba bands and the emergence of zero-energy MBS will be studied as a function of chain structure, length, and composition. We aim to construct model-type platforms, such as T-junctions, rings, and complex network structures, for the exploration of MBS.\n\nThe proposed techniques for probing the system include spin-resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), scanning Josephson tunneling spectroscopy, and multi-probe STS. These will allow us to manipulate and braid MBS, investigate the magnetic state of atomic wires, study the spin-polarization of MBS, and explore the spatial nature of the superconducting order parameter. Ultimately, our research will attempt to directly probe the quantum exchange statistics of non-Abelian anyons, providing a leap forward in our understanding of topological quantum computation and paving the way for the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Magma-Assisted Tectonics: Two-Phase Dynamics of Oceanic and Continental Rifts\n\nThe proposed research project aims to revolutionize our understanding of plate tectonics by developing comprehensive models that treat magmatism as an essential thermal, chemical, and mechanical component rather than a mere by-product of tectonic processes. Recognizing the central role of magmatism at divergent plate boundaries, this project seeks to elucidate the basic functioning of plate tectonics through innovative two-phase dynamic models that could explain the intricacies of continental rifts and mid-ocean ridges.\n\nFor decades, observations at divergent boundaries have accumulated, yet many issues, both old and new, have remained unresolved. This initiative is poised to address these gaps by focusing on the requirement of magmatic intrusion for continental rifting and the influence of magma supply variation on the crustal emplacement and faulting at mid-ocean ridges. The research will implement a two-phase theory that accounts for the interpenetration of liquid and solid continua, conserving mass, momentum, and energy, and incorporating a viscoelastic-plastic/frictional rheology.\n\nThe proposed models are designed to capture rock failure under tensile effective stress and the consistent interaction between dikes and faults. Validation of the models will be conducted through comparative analyses of surface deformation, seismic tomography products, and the geochemistry of lavas. Collaborative efforts with project partners in key regions, such as the East African Rift System and the Juan de Fuca ridge, will enhance the scope and applicability of the research findings.\n\nOutreach components include support for mathematics in Africa, fostering international collaboration and skill development. Additionally, the open-source availability of our modeling code will facilitate widespread adoption and further refinement within the scientific community.\n\nThe impact of this project is expected to be transformative, offering a new lens through which the scientific community can view and understand magma-assisted tectonics, with implications for geothermal energy exploration, natural disaster prediction, and the global carbon cycle.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Magma-Assisted Tectonics: Two-Phase Dynamics of Oceanic and Continental Rifts\n\nThe proposed project titled \"Magma-Assisted Tectonics: Two-Phase Dynamics of Oceanic and Continental Rifts\" seeks to advance our understanding of the basic functioning of plate tectonics by developing models that regard magmatism as an integral component, rather than a secondary by-product. Despite decades of observations at divergent plate boundaries, a comprehensive model that encapsulates the role of magma in tectonic processes remains elusive.\n\nThis proposal emphasizes the central role of magmatism at divergent boundaries, particularly within continental rifts, where magmatic intrusion is a necessity for rifting, and at mid-ocean ridges, where variations in magma supply directly affect crustal emplacement and faulting. The research will employ a novel two-phase theory application that models the interaction between interpenetrating liquid and solid phases, while conserving mass, momentum, and energy. The proposed models will feature a sophisticated rheology that is viscoelastic-plastic/frictional, capable of simulating rock failure under tensile effective stress and the consistent interaction between dikes and faults.\n\nValidation of these models will be achieved through comparative analysis with observations of surface deformation/relief, seismic tomography products, and the geochemistry of lavas, ensuring that the models accurately reflect the complexities of natural systems. Collaboration with key partners at the East African Rift System and the Juan de Fuca ridge will provide the project with a broad and relevant dataset, while outreach efforts will focus on supporting mathematics education in Africa.\n\nThe impact of this project is anticipated to be transformative, altering the scientific community's understanding of magma-assisted tectonics and providing open-source code to facilitate further research and collaboration. Ultimately, this project aims to resolve long-standing issues in the field by integrating a comprehensive treatment of magmatism into tectonic models, thereby enhancing our ability to interpret geological processes on Earth.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Magma-Assisted Tectonics: two-phase dynamics of oceanic and continental rifts,\" aims to revolutionize our understanding of plate tectonics by developing comprehensive models that consider magmatism not merely as a by-product but as an integral thermal, chemical, and mechanical component of tectonic processes. Despite decades of observation, significant issues concerning the role of magmatism in continental rifts and mid-ocean ridges have remained unresolved, primarily due to the limitations of current tectonic models. This research seeks to address these gaps by focusing on the development of two-phase dynamic models that describe the interplay between magmatic intrusion and lithospheric deformation.\n\nThe project will utilize a novel two-phase theory approach, employing viscoelastic-plastic/frictional rheology to simulate the interaction between solid and liquid components of the Earth's crust. This approach will provide a framework to model rock failure under tensile effective stress and to detail the consistent interaction between dikes and faults. The models' predictions will be validated through comparative analysis of surface deformation, seismic tomography, and the geochemistry of lavas. Collaborations with research initiatives at the East African Rift System and the Juan de Fuca ridge will enrich the project with field data and regional expertise.\n\nIn addition to advancing scientific knowledge, the project is committed to outreach efforts, specifically supporting the development of mathematics in Africa. The models developed will be made available as open-source code, fostering transparency and collaborative advancement in the field. The anticipated impact of this research is the transformation of our understanding of magma-assisted tectonics, with implications for predicting geological hazards and understanding Earth's evolutionary history.",

Recognizing the central role of magmatism at divergent plate boundaries, this project is driven by the objective to elucidate the basic mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of continental rifts and mid-ocean ridges.\n\nBuilding on decades of meticulous observations of divergent boundaries, we aim to resolve outstanding issues by incorporating two-phase dynamics into our models. These models are characterized by the interaction of interpenetrating liquid and solid phases, governed by conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy, and a viscoelastic-plastic/frictional rheology. Our approach will enable us to accurately describe the conditions that lead to rock failure under tensile effective stress and the interaction between dikes and faults.\n\nThe project will validate its findings by performing comparative analyses with existing data, including surface deformation and relief, seismic tomography, and the geochemistry of lavas. These validation methods will ensure that the models reflect the complex realities of magma-assisted tectonic processes.\n\nCollaborations with research partners in key regions, such as the East African Rift System and the Juan de Fuca ridge, will enable the collection of invaluable field data, further strengthening the projectâ€™s outcomes. Additionally, the project will support mathematics education in Africa through outreach programs, emphasizing the global impact of the research.\n\nThe transformative potential of this project lies in its capacity to integrate magmatism into the dynamics of tectonic processes, thereby offering a comprehensive framework for understanding the thermal, chemical, and mechanical interactions that shape the Earth's lithosphere.

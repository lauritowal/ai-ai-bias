        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives,\" aims to critically examine the multifaceted role that narrative plays in modern science. Spanning across the human, social, and natural sciences, this project will explore how narratives have been utilized over the past two centuries to construct meaning, facilitate understanding, and articulate scientific explanations within various disciplines. By analyzing narrative applications in both real and virtual situations, empirical work, and theorizing, the research seeks to reveal the significant functions narratives carry out beyond their conventional use for mere reporting.\n\nA notable gap exists in our understanding of the types and natures of knowledge produced through narrative processes in science, except for recognized applications in medicine and evolutionary biology. This project will address this gap by asking crucial questions about the gains and functions of narrative use by scientists. Preliminary research suggests that narratives contribute significantly to the coherence and fit of research findings within the scientific community. Despite their ubiquitous presence, there is a striking variation in how narratives are ordered and employed from one site to another, and between different scientific fields. This variability will be investigated through a broad range of case studies, including the path-dependent systems in nineteenth-century biology, the configuring narratives in mid-twentieth-century sociology, and 'how possibly' narratives in modern computer-based simulations.\n\nThe challenge lies in making sense of this diversity in narrative usage and understanding. The project will probe the commonality that narratives function to answer scientific questions and provide explanations, thus offering a more comprehensive view of the epistemic contributions of narrative knowledge in science. By dissecting the roles and significance of narrative, the project will provide a historical perspective on the evolution of narrative knowing and its impact on scientific inquiry and understanding.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, \"Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives,\" seeks funding to explore the role of narrative within the realm of modern science across human, social, and natural sciences over the past two centuries. Despite narratives being omnipresent in scientific discourse, their function extends far beyond mere reporting. This interdisciplinary research aims to delve into the nature and constitution of 'narrative knowing'—a fundamental yet underexplored facet of scientific understanding and communication.\n\nThe project will conduct a comprehensive analysis of narrative applications in various contexts, including real and virtual situations, empirical work, and theoretical constructs. Special attention will be paid to the significant roles narratives play in creating coherence, answering scientific questions, and providing explanations which contribute to the advancement of knowledge. Notably, narratives have been largely neglected in the study of field narratives across disciplines, with exceptions in medicine and evolutionary biology.\n\nOur research questions focus on what scientists gain from the use of narratives and the multifunctional roles they play within scientific processes. Initial findings suggest that narratives are instrumental in figuring out coherence and fitting research within broader scientific frameworks. However, the ordering and application of narratives demonstrably vary from site to site and across different scientific fields. This presents a challenge in understanding the diversity of narrative usage and its implications for scientific practice.\n\nThrough a series of case studies, including the examination of path-dependent systems in nineteenth-century biology, narratives of mid-twentieth century sociology case studies, and ‘how possibly’ narratives in modern computer-based simulations, the project will illuminate how narrative variety is navigated within the scientific community. The outcome of this research will fill the knowledge gap regarding the types of knowledge obtained from narratives and how they contribute to the epistemology of science.\n\nBy elucidating the common yet intricate role of narratives, this project will provide novel insights into how scientific explanations are constructed and understood, thereby benefiting the scientific community's approach to knowledge dissemination and innovation.",
        "Abstract\n\nTitle: Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives\n\nThis grant proposal seeks to explore the indispensable role of narrative in the evolution of modern science across the human, social, and natural sciences over the past two centuries. Despite its prevalence, the types of knowledge constructed through narrative and its essential constitution remain significantly understudied, especially outside the domains of medicine and evolutionary biology. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by addressing pivotal research questions: What do scientists gain from employing narratives, and what functions do these narratives fulfill?\n\nPreliminary findings suggest that narratives are instrumental in achieving coherence and fitting diverse pieces of research into a comprehensible framework. This project will delve into the variety of narratives used, recognizing that their ordering and application differ substantially from one scientific field to another and from one site to another. Through a series of broad case studies, including examples such as path-dependent systems in nineteenth-century biology, narratives of mid-twentieth-century sociology, and ‘how possibly’ narratives in modern computer-based simulations, this research will systematically investigate how narratives have been applied in both real and virtual situations, empirical work, and theorizing.\n\nMoreover, the project intends to elucidate the common narrative function of answering scientific questions and providing explanations that go beyond mere description and reporting. By doing so, it seeks to make sense of the diverse narrative uses within the sciences, highlighting the significant roles that narratives play beyond their traditional conceptualization.\n\nThe challenge lies in comprehensively understanding the variability in narrative use and its implications for scientific inquiry. The anticipated outcome is a deeper comprehension of 'narrative knowing'—its nature, constitution, and significance—thus contributing to a more holistic understanding of scientific processes and knowledge creation.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe project \"Narrative Ordering and Explanation in the Sciences: Historical Investigations and Perspectives\" aims to critically examine the role of narrative in the development and communication of scientific knowledge. Despite narratives being pervasive across the human, social, and natural sciences over the past two centuries, their significance extends beyond mere reporting. This project seeks to address the knowledge gap regarding the types of knowledge narrative yields and how it is constituted within scientific practices, with a specific focus on fields that have historically neglected narrative studies, except in medicine and evolutionary biology.\n\nCentral research questions include: What do scientists gain from using narratives, and what functions do narratives fulfill in the scientific process? Preliminary research suggests that narratives contribute to creating coherence and fitting diverse elements together in research. The project will investigate the variability of narrative ordering, which exhibits differences from site to site and from one scientific discipline to another, as evidenced by case studies from nineteenth-century biology, mid-twentieth-century sociology, and modern computer-based simulations.\n\nThe project's scope is broad, involving numerous case studies to explore narratives in real and virtual situations, empirical work, and theorizing. One of the major challenges is to make sense of the variety of narrative use across the sciences. However, a common thread identified is that narratives often function to answer scientific questions and provide explanations, thereby contributing to the construction of scientific knowledge.\n\nThis research will fill a critical gap in our understanding of how narrative knowing is constituted and the roles it plays across different scientific contexts. By elucidating the diverse functions and applications of narrative in the sciences, the project will significantly advance our comprehension of science as a narrative practice, enhancing the way we perceive the construction of knowledge within the scientific community."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe project, \"Repair mechanisms of topoisomerase II DNA lesions,\" aims to elucidate the cellular processes that resolve DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) induced by topoisomerase II (TOP2) and chemotherapeutics such as etoposide. Since its approval in 1983, etoposide has been extensively used to treat various cancers, including leukemias, lymphomas, and ovarian cancer. However, its efficacy is limited by the cellular ability to repair TOP2-induced DNA lesions, specifically TOP2-DPCs. These lesions stall the catalytic cycle of TOP2 and can lead to genomic instability if not properly resolved.\n\nOur research will focus on understanding the activation, coordination, and cellular preference of repair modes for TOP2-DPCs. We will investigate the role of the regulatory enzyme ZATT, which SUMOylates TOP2, facilitating the resolution of TOP2-DPCs. Using Xenopus egg extracts, a proven method to recapitulate DNA repair mechanisms, we have already demonstrated that ZATT-mediated SUMOylation is central to the repair process.\n\nThe study will address three main research questions: How are different repair modes activated? How do they coordinate? And what dictates the choice of repair pathway in cells? Through genetic data analysis, the primary responder to these lesions has been identified as ZATT. Hence, our research will provide a detailed molecular understanding of the repair mechanisms, unravel the molecular triggers that initiate different repair routes, and offer insights into the coordination of these pathways.\n\nThe outcomes of this research have the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and improve cancer treatment by exploiting the repair mechanisms of TOP2-DPCs. By enhancing our understanding of the cellular response to chemotherapeutic-induced DNA lesions, we aim to contribute to the development of more effective and personalized cancer therapies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Repair Mechanisms of Topoisomerase II DNA Lesions,\" aims to elucidate the cellular processes that counteract TOP2-DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP2-DPCs), deleterious lesions that arise from the use of topoisomerase II (TOP2) chemotherapeutics such as etoposide. Since its approval in 1983, etoposide has been widely utilized in the treatment of various cancers including leukemias, lymphomas, and lung, testicular, and ovarian cancers. Despite its efficacy, the repair pathways for TOP2-DPCs remain poorly understood, which this project seeks to address.\n\nThe research will focus on the activation, coordination, and cellular preference of repair modes for TOP2-DPC lesions, with the key protein ZATT—a SUMOylating enzyme for TOP2—serving as the primary responder. Leveraging Xenopus egg extracts, which have been shown to recapitulate DNA repair mechanisms, the project will study the molecular underpinnings of TOP2-DPC repair.\n\nPreliminary data have established the role of ZATT SUMOylation in TOP2-DPC repair within these extracts, setting the stage for a deeper investigation into the molecular triggers that govern repair pathways. The research goals include a comprehensive molecular understanding of TOP2 lesion repair mechanisms and the identification of molecular triggers that dictate repair route preferences.\n\nThe expected outcomes of this research include the delineation of new opportunities and targets for the enhancement of cancer treatments. By advancing our knowledge of TOP2-DPC repair, this project has the potential to improve therapeutic strategies and outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Repair Mechanisms of Topoisomerase II DNA Lesions\n\nThe proposed research seeks to elucidate the cellular repair mechanisms for DNA lesions caused by Topoisomerase II (TOP2) chemotherapeutics, focusing on the DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP2-DPCs) induced by etoposide, a drug first approved in 1983 and widely used to treat various cancers including leukemias, lymphomas, and several solid tumors. Despite the clinical success of etoposide, the repair pathways for TOP2-DPCs are not fully understood. Our study aims to dissect the repair processes at a molecular level, which could reveal novel strategies to improve cancer treatment outcomes.\n\nThe project will investigate the cellular response to TOP2-DPCs, specifically examining the activation, coordination, and preference of repair modes by cells. We hypothesize that the regulatory enzyme ZATT plays a pivotal role in this process through its activity of SUMOylating TOP2, thus stimulating the resolution of TOP2-DPCs. Preliminary data using Xenopus egg extracts have shown that these extracts can recapitulate TOP2-DPC repair via ZATT SUMOylation, supporting the relevance of ZATT as a primary responder in the repair mechanism.\n\nOur research approach will utilize Xenopus egg extracts to model the DNA repair mechanisms, leveraging genetic data indicating ZATT as the key protein. The study will address three key research questions: how repair modes are activated, how they are coordinated, and which modes are preferred by cells. We aim to provide a molecular understanding of repair mechanisms, delineate the molecular triggers for repair routes, and identify new targets for cancer treatment.\n\nThe outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly impact cancer therapeutics by providing new opportunities and targets for enhancing the efficacy of TOP2 chemotherapeutics and reducing their toxic side effects.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, entitled \"Repair mechanisms of topoisomerase II DNA lesions,\" aims to elucidate the cellular responses to DNA-protein crosslinks (TOP2-DPCs) arising from the use of topoisomerase II (TOP2) chemotherapeutics such as etoposide. Since its approval in 1983, etoposide has been a cornerstone treatment for various cancers including leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors. However, the repair pathways that cells employ to counteract TOP2-DPCs, which can stall the catalytic cycle and compromise genomic integrity, remain inadequately defined.\n\nUsing Xenopus egg extracts, a system that faithfully recapitulates DNA repair mechanisms, this research will dissect the molecular processes behind TOP2-DPC repair. Preliminary data suggest that the SUMOylation of TOP2 by the enzyme ZATT is a primary response to TOP2-DPC damage, implying that ZATT is a critical player in the repair cascade. This study will investigate the activation, coordination, and cellular preference among distinct repair modes, including crosslink reversal, protein adduct degradation, and DNA incision.\n\nThe main research questions are centered around the mechanisms by which repair is activated, how different repair pathways are coordinated, and which pathways are preferentially employed by cells. Our goals are to achieve a molecular understanding of TOP2-DPC repair mechanisms, identify molecular triggers for repair routes, and, ultimately, uncover new opportunities and targets for cancer treatment improvement.\n\nThis research holds the potential to enhance our understanding of genomic stability, inform the development of targeted cancer therapies, and mitigate the side effects associated with chemotherapeutic treatment. Given the widespread clinical use of TOP2 inhibitors and the prevalence of treatment-associated secondary malignancies, the findings from this study could have significant implications for cancer therapy and patient prognosis."

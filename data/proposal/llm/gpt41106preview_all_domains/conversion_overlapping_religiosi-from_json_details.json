        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Conversion, Overlapping Religiosities, Polemics, Interaction: Early Modern Iberia and Beyond,\" spearheaded by researcher Martín de Figuerola, seeks to elucidate the intricate web of religious exchanges and tensions in sixteenth-century Iberia, a period and place of dramatic religious transformation. The focus is on the Muslims of Valencia and Aragon, with a particular case study highlighting local Muslim marriage customs as reported by de Figuerola, a convert from Islam himself. The project's core objectives are to analyze the cross-currents among different religious groups, investigate the phenomena of local religiosity with overlapping religious practices, and examine the efforts by various social actors and scholars to establish clear religious identities.\n\nThe historical backdrop of this study includes the expulsion of Jews from Iberia, the forced conversion of Muslims to Christianity, and the subsequent expulsion of these converted Muslims. Through a detailed examination of archival materials such as Inquisition trials, manuscripts, early modern editions, and polemical literature, including new translations of the Qur’an and other Jewish and Islamic classics, the project intends to explore the complex interplay of cross-currents common to different religious groups. The work will also review how these groups maintain their distinct identities or merge into hybrid forms of religiosity.\n\nDe Figuerola's unique perspective as a Muslim judge from Cocentaina who converted to Christianity provides an intimate glimpse into the overlapping religious practices and beliefs of the time. This includes anecdotal evidence of Muslim women demanding to participate in religious festivities in Valencia, such as Corpus Christi and the celebration of the Virgin Mary in August.\n\nBy critically engaging with sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts and conducting comprehensive archival research, this project aims to contribute significantly to our understanding of the fluidity and polemics of religious identities during a pivotal era of Iberian history. The findings will be of immense value not only to scholars of religious studies and historians but also to those interested in the broader topics of cultural interactions and identity formation in early modern Europe.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Conversion, Overlapping Religiosities, Polemics, Interaction: Early Modern Iberia and Beyond,\" spearheaded by Martín de Figuerola, a scholar and convert from Islam, endeavors to dissect the intricate web of religious interactions in sixteenth-century Iberia. This period is characterized by the dramatic religious transformations resulting from the expulsion of Jews, forced conversions of Muslims to Christianity, and the subsequent expulsion of these converted Muslims. The project's focal point is the examination of the complex cross-currents among different religious groups, particularly Muslims in Valencia and Aragon, and the exploration of local religiosities where different religions overlapped, leading to vague or hybrid religiosities.\n\nThe research will utilize an array of methodologies including archival research, analysis of Inquisition trials, examination of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, and review of polemical literature. Primary sources such as manuscripts, early modern editions, new translations of the Qur'an, Jewish and Islamic classics, and polemical literature will be instrumental in this study.\n\nA unique case study within the project is centered around an anecdote provided by Martín de Figuerola, highlighting marriage contract customs among local Muslims in Cocentaina, Valencia, and their demands for festive visits to Valencia during religious celebrations like Corpus Christi and the Virgin Mary festivities in August. This anecdote serves as a lens to view the broader patterns of hybrid religiosity and the efforts by social actors and scholars to establish clear religious differentiations.\n\nThe project's aim is to unveil the adversarial relationships and dependencies that shaped the religious landscape of early modern Iberia. By analyzing these overlaps and interactions, the research intends to contribute substantially to our understanding of the period's complex religiosity and the sociopolitical mechanisms that sought to manage and control the religious identities during a time of significant change.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project, \"Conversion, Overlapping Religiosities, Polemics, Interaction: Early Modern Iberia and Beyond,\" spearheaded by Martín de Figuerola, a scholar of early modern religious interactions and a convert from Islam, seeks to unravel the complex interplay of religious dynamics in sixteenth-century Iberia. This era witnessed dramatic shifts in religious identities, marked by the expulsion of Jews, forced conversions of Muslims to Christianity, and the subsequent expulsion of these conversos.\n\nFocusing on the Muslims of Valencia and Aragon, the project aims to analyze the intricate cross-currents among religious groups, explore the phenomenon of overlapping local religiosities, and examine the emergence of vague or hybrid religiosities. In particular, it will investigate how social actors and scholars strived to establish clear religious differentiations during a period characterized by adversarial relationships and dependencies between religious communities.\n\nThe research will employ a robust methodology, including archival research, particularly of Inquisition trials, and an examination of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, manuscripts, early modern editions, translations of the Qur’an, Jewish and Islamic classics, and polemical literature. A case study of peculiar interest is based on an anecdote from Cocentaina, Valencia, where Martín de Figuerola reports on marriage contract customs among local Muslims that demanded husbands take their wives to Valencia for festivities such as Corpus Christi and the Virgin Mary in August. This anecdote serves as a gateway to understanding the interwoven nature of religious practices and the societal forces at play.\n\nBy delving into these diverse sources, the project will provide a nuanced understanding of the religious transformations in early modern Iberia and contribute valuable insights into the historical dynamics that shaped the overlapping religious identities in a context of polemics and interaction. The outcomes of this research will not only enhance academic knowledge but also offer a deeper appreciation of the historical processes that have influenced modern religious coexistence and conflict.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThis grant proposal, titled \"Conversion, Overlapping Religiosities, Polemics, Interaction: Early Modern Iberia and Beyond,\" seeks to dissect the intricate web of religious interplay and dynamics in sixteenth-century Iberia, a period marked by profound religious transformations. The principal investigator, Martín de Figuerola, a convert from Islam, aims to explore the nuanced interactions among Muslims of Valencia and Aragon, social actors, and scholars during a time of turbulent religious change, including the expulsion of Jews, forced conversions, and the later expulsion of Muslims who had converted to Christianity.\n\nThe proposed project will analyze how cross-currents among different religious groups led to the emergence of local overlapping religiosities and the development of vague or hybrid religious identities. It will also examine the determined efforts by various social actors and scholars to establish clear religious ascriptions and categorizations. By focusing on case studies such as the anecdote from Cocentaina regarding Muslim marriage contract customs, the project will offer a microcosmic view of broader regional practices and beliefs.\n\nThe research methodology includes comprehensive archival research, meticulous analysis of Inquisition trials, and an examination of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, including new translations of the Qur’an, Jewish and Islamic classics, and polemical literature. These materials will provide a multifaceted perspective on the adversarial relationships and dependencies that defined the period's religious landscape.\n\nThe anticipated outcome of the research is to enhance our understanding of the complexity of religious identities during a pivotal moment in Iberian history. By unveiling the layers of religious interaction and polemics, this project will contribute significantly to historical scholarship on early modern Europe and the enduring legacies of religious conversion, conflict, and coexistence.\n\nKeywords: Iberia, sixteenth-century, religious conversion, overlapping religiosities, Inquisition, archival research, Martín de Figuerola."

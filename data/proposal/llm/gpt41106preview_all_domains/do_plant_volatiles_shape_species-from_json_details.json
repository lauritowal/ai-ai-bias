        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Do plant volatiles shape species interactions in agroecological fields?\n\nThe PANOPLY project seeks to investigate the pivotal role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in dictating the dynamics of plant-insect interactions within agroecological systems, with a specific focus on perennial crops. The primary subject of this research is the grapevine (Vitis vinifera), a commercially significant crop threatened by the leafhopper (Scaphoideus titanus) and associated disease Flavescence dorée (FD). Through a multi-scale approach from laboratory to field studies, PANOPLY aims to elucidate the influence of VOCs on these critical species interactions over the long term.\n\nThe research objectives include: (1) identifying specific VOCs that affect leafhopper life history traits, (2) validating the impact of VOCs on insect behavior and survival within controlled greenhouse and common garden conditions, and (3) testing the employment of aromatic plants in field experiments to determine the role of VOCs in multitrophic interactions.\n\nPANOPLY is poised to provide the first comprehensive demonstration of how VOCs shape multitrophic interactions in perennial plants, addressing a significant knowledge gap. The expected outcomes encompass understanding the mechanisms of plant-mediated cues, determining long-term effects on plant-insect interactions, and fostering new research pathways in chemical ecology and agroecology. These insights have the potential to greatly enhance crop health and insect biodiversity, contribute to biological pest control strategies, and advocate for zero-pesticide use in agriculture.\n\nThis groundbreaking research promises to reveal foundational principles of chemical ecology with immediate applications in agroecological management and the sustainability of food production systems. The PANOPLY project embodies an innovative step towards environmentally friendly agricultural practices, with a ripple effect on the preservation of ecological balance and the promotion of biodiversity.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Do plant volatiles shape species interactions in agroecological fields?\n\nProject Name: PANOPLY\n\nThis grant proposal outlines the PANOPLY project, which seeks to investigate the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in shaping the interactions between plants and insects in agroecological fields, with a specific focus on the European grapevine (Vitis vinifera), its pest the leafhopper (Scaphoideus titanus), and the disease Flavescence dorée (FD). The primary objective of PANOPLY is to elucidate how VOCs emitted by grapevines and surrounding aromatic plants influence the life history traits, behaviors, and survival of leafhoppers, and how these interactions can lead to the development of sustainable pest control methods that align with zero-pesticide use strategies.\n\nThe research will be conducted on a long-term scale, transitioning from lab-based studies to greenhouse and common garden experiments, and culminating in extensive field experiments to validate the effects of VOCs. The project is poised to identify specific VOCs that affect leafhopper populations and to assess their efficacy in a natural agroecological context.\n\nExpected outcomes of PANOPLY include a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of plant-mediated chemical cues and their long-term impacts on plant-insect interactions, with a broader implication for chemical ecology and agroecology research. Furthermore, the project aims to enhance overall crop health and promote insect biodiversity through the principles of biological pest control, which will benefit the environment and agricultural sustainability.\n\nThe project stands out as the first of its kind to demonstrate the significant role of VOCs in shaping complex multitrophic interactions in perennial plant systems. By addressing a substantial knowledge gap, PANOPLY will provide insights that could transform current agricultural practices and contribute to the global effort of reducing chemical pesticide usage in favor of more ecological pest management strategies.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe PANOPLY project, titled \"Do plant volatiles shape species interactions in agroecological fields?\", aims to revolutionize our understanding of plant-insect dynamics by focusing on the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in these interactions. This innovative research seeks to elucidate how VOCs emitted by grapevines (Vitis vinifera) impact the life history traits of herbivore pests such as the leafhopper (Scaphoideus titanus) and the spread of diseases like Flavescence dorée (FD), which pose significant threats to European grapevines.\n\nWith a research framework that transitions from laboratory to field settings, PANOPLY is designed as a long-term study that will identify the specific VOCs influencing leafhopper behavior and survival. The research objectives include: (1) pinpointing the VOCs that affect leafhopper's life history traits; (2) validating the effects of VOCs through controlled greenhouse and common garden experiments; and (3) testing the influence of aromatic plants in field experiments to understand their role in multitrophic interactions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of PANOPLY are multifaceted, ranging from uncovering the mechanisms of plant-mediated chemical cues to determining the long-term effects of VOCs on plant-insect interactions. The project will open new research avenues in chemical ecology and agroecology, ultimately contributing to enhanced crop health, increased insect biodiversity, and the development of sustainable biological pest control strategies, leading towards a future of zero-pesticide use.\n\nPANOPLY stands out as the first project to systematically study the role of VOCs in shaping multitrophic interactions in perennial plant systems on a long-term scale in actual field conditions. Its groundbreaking approach promises to address a significant knowledge gap, offering potential applications that extend beyond the scope of traditional pest management, to improve agroecosystem resilience and sustainability.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Do plant volatiles shape species interactions in agroecological fields?\n\nThe PANOPLY project seeks to investigate the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in plant-insect interactions within agroecological systems, with an emphasis on the grapevine (Vitis vinifera) as a model organism. This research aims to address the significant knowledge gap in how VOCs influence the behavior and survival of the leafhopper pest (Scaphoideus titanus) and the spread of the Flavescence dorée (FD) disease, posing a threat to European grapevines.\n\nThrough a multiphase approach from the laboratory to the field, the project will identify key VOCs that impact leafhopper life history traits, validate the effects of these VOCs through greenhouse and common garden experiments, and test aromatic plants in field experiments to determine the long-term role of VOCs in shaping multitrophic interactions. The primary objectives are to elucidate the mechanisms of plant-mediated cues and assess their long-term influence on plant-insect relationships.\n\nPANOPLY is poised to be the first project to demonstrate the influence of VOCs on multitrophic interactions in perennial plant species on a long-term scale in field conditions. Anticipated outcomes include a deeper understanding of chemical ecology and agroecology, enhanced crop health, increased insect biodiversity, and advancements in biological pest control. The project aligns with sustainable agricultural practices by promoting the use of zero-pesticides and offers potential strategies for pest management through the exploitation of naturally occurring VOCs.\n\nThis pioneering research has the potential to open novel research avenues in chemical ecology and agroecology, contributing significantly to the field of plant-insect interactions. The outcomes of PANOPLY will have far-reaching implications for sustainable agriculture and the preservation of agroecosystem health and biodiversity."

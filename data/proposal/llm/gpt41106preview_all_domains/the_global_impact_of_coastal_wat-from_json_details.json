        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project \"The global impact of coastal water contamination on economic development\" (GLOBCOADEV) aims to systematically investigate the causal relationship between coastal water contamination and its far-reaching effects on the socio-economic development of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where over 3 billion people depend on these waters for their livelihood and food security. Coastal waters play a critical role in global food security and the disruption of these ecosystems due to contamination poses a significant threat to marine life and the well-being of populations relying on these resources.\n\nThis project seeks to address the considerable knowledge gap that currently exists in understanding the extent of coastal water contamination's impact on economic development. Through an innovative research approach that exploits exogenous variation in coastal water pollution over the last five decades, GLOBCOADEV will provide novel insights on a global scale. The project will utilize a range of data sources, including household surveys and satellite imaging, and employ advanced micro-econometric techniques to analyze the data.\n\nThe objectives of GLOBCOADEV are threefold: First, to provide global evidence of the effect of coastal water contamination on early-childhood development, with a specific focus on nutrition. Second, to determine the impact of coastal water contamination on local economic activities, particularly fishing patterns and their relation to economic development indicators. Third, to investigate the side effects of coastal water contamination, such as changes in political attitudes, the emergence of violence, and patterns of rural-urban migration.\n\nThe expected outcomes of GLOBCOADEV are to fill a critical gap in the academic literature, influence the design of environmental protection policies, and align with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The project's findings will be essential for informing policymakers and stakeholders in devising effective strategies to mitigate the negative effects of coastal water contamination and enhance the resilience of LMIC communities.",
        "Abstract\n\nTitle: The Global Impact of Coastal Water Contamination on Economic Development (GLOBCOADEV)\n\nCoastal waters are essential for global food security and the livelihood of over 3 billion people, predominantly living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The project GLOBCOADEV seeks to explore the critical link between coastal water contamination and economic development, a subject with extensive implications yet highly limited current knowledge. Through a novel approach exploiting exogenous variation in coastal water contamination, this research will analyze data spanning the last five decades on a global scale for all LMICs. \n\nThe innovative methodology will incorporate advanced micro-econometric techniques to evaluate household surveys and satellite imagery, providing robust insights into the causal effects of coastal water contamination. GLOBCOADEV has three primary objectives: (1) to provide global evidence of the effect of coastal water contamination on early-childhood development, with a special focus on nutrition; (2) to determine how coastal water contamination affects local economic activities, focusing on fishing patterns and overall economic development indicators; and (3) to investigate the side effects of coastal water contamination on local economies, including changes in political attitudes, violence, and rural-urban migration.\n\nExpected outcomes of this research include significant contributions to the existing literature, the potential to influence policy design to protect and manage coastal waters better, and the alignment with the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals. By filling a crucial gap in understanding the socio-economic repercussions of coastal water contamination, the project GLOBCOADEV will provide policymakers with evidence-based recommendations to formulate effective environmental protection policies and sustainable development strategies, thereby fostering resilience in LMICs against environmental adversities.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: The Global Impact of Coastal Water Contamination on Economic Development (Project GLOBCOADEV)\n\nCoastal waters, critical for global food security, sustain the livelihoods of over three billion people predominantly residing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, contamination of these waters has notable implications for marine life and socio-economic development. The current knowledge on the breadth of these effects is highly limited, signaling a pressing need for comprehensive research. Project GLOBCOADEV seeks to address this gap by providing novel insights into the causal effects of coastal water contamination on economic development in LMICs.\n\nUtilizing advanced micro-econometric techniques and exploiting exogenous variations in contamination sources, such as rivers' release patterns and climate change, this project will analyze global data spanning the last five decades. Data will be collected through household surveys and satellite imaging to ensure a robust and detailed understanding of the issues at hand.\n\nThe research objectives are threefold: firstly, to provide global evidence of the effect of coastal water contamination on early-childhood development, with a focus on nutrition; secondly, to determine the impact on local economic activities, specifically assessing fishing patterns and economic development indicators; and thirdly, to investigate the side effects, including changes in political attitudes, violence, and patterns of rural-urban migration.\n\nExpected outcomes of the project include a significant contribution to the literature on environmental and economic development, the influence on the design and implementation of environmental protection policies, and the alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. By generating a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted impacts of coastal water contamination, Project GLOBCOADEV aims to inform and transform policy design and interventions, ensuring the preservation and sustainable use of coastal resources for future generations.\n\nKeywords: coastal water contamination, economic development, LMICs, food security, policy design, UN Sustainable Development Goals.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed research project \"The Global Impact of Coastal Water Contamination on Economic Development\" (GLOBCOADEV) seeks to address a critical gap in understanding how coastal water pollution affects socio-economic development in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), home to over three billion people. Coastal waters are vital for food security and livelihoods, yet their contamination has profound implications for marine life and local economies. This study's pioneering research aims to provide insights into the causal relationships between coastal water contamination and economic development over the past five decades on a global scale.\n\nThe GLOBCOADEV project will utilize advanced micro-econometric techniques to exploit exogenous variation in contamination events such as rivers' release patterns and climate change influences, thus enabling a robust analysis of the long-term impacts of pollution. The project will rely on a wide array of data sources, including household surveys and satellite imaging, to achieve its objectives.\n\nThe objectives of the research are threefold: firstly, to assess the effect of coastal water contamination on early-childhood development, with a particular focus on nutrition; secondly, to determine the impact on local economic activities, especially fishing patterns and broader economic development indicators; and thirdly, to investigate the side effects of contamination, including shifts in political attitudes, an upsurge in violence, and rural-urban migration trends.\n\nAnticipated outcomes of GLOBCOADEV include substantial contributions to the academic literature, influencing the design of evidence-based environmental protection policies, and aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). By addressing the existing knowledge limitations, the project holds the potential to inform interventions that could safeguard and enhance food security, protect livelihoods, and foster sustainable economic development in affected populations across LMICs."

        "Abstract:\n\nThe \"Next-Generation of Interior models of (Exo)planets\" (N-GINE) project is poised to transform our understanding of giant planet interiors and their evolutionary processes. With the prevalence of metals in exoplanet atmospheres serving as a critical tracer for gas giant formation, current theoretical frameworks, which rely on the assumption of a homogeneous well-mixed envelope around a core, are now challenged by recent discoveries of non-homogeneous envelopes in Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nCapitalizing on this pivotal moment, N-GINE seeks to integrate novel insights into exoplanet studies, leveraging a unique convergence of data from solar system giants via missions like Cassini and Juno, and the unparalleled observational capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The principal investigator, with a unique expertise in exoplanet and solar system science, will lead a dynamic team comprised of three PhD students and two postdocs. This team will deliver groundbreaking resources including the first open-source retrieval tool for exoplanet interiors and a comprehensive database on refractory species in exoplanet atmospheres. The project will also develop self-consistent models to study atmosphere-interior interactions and generate new interior models for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune that reflect non-homogeneous structures.\n\nEmploying advanced methodologies such as neural networks in model development, N-GINE is set to revolutionize the way atmospheric chemical compositions and retrieval calculations are performed. This will have a profound impact on the interpretation of exoplanet observations, enriching our understanding of their origins and providing a robust framework for future research.\n\nThe deliverables from this project promise to set a new standard in the field, offering the scientific community unparalleled tools and data that enable more accurate and comprehensive studies of exoplanet interiors, atmospheres, and their intricate interplay. N-GINE stands at the forefront of a scientific revolution that will decode the mysteries of giant planets within and beyond our solar system.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Next-Generation of Interior models of (Exo)planets: Studying the interior structure of giant planets and its effect on their evolution, atmospheres, and observations\" (N-GINE), aims to transform the field of exoplanetary science by developing new models that reflect the complex interior structures of giant planets. Recent data has revealed that the envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn are non-homogeneous, challenging the prevailing theoretical framework that posits a core surrounded by a homogeneous, well-mixed envelope. These findings indicate that metals present in exoplanet atmospheres are critical tracers of gas giant formation, necessitating an updated approach to studying these celestial bodies.\n\nN-GINE will incorporate this newfound knowledge into the study of exoplanets at an opportune moment, given the wealth of data available from Cassini, Juno, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Led by a principal investigator with unique expertise in both exoplanet and solar system science, the project team includes three PhD students and two postdocs who will work collaboratively to achieve several groundbreaking deliverables. These include the first open-source retrieval tool for exoplanet interiors, a comprehensive database on refractory species in exoplanet atmospheres, novel models that examine atmosphere-interior interactions, and new non-homogeneous interior models for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\nEmploying innovative research methods such as self-consistent atmospheric radiative transfer and neural networks, the project promises to significantly impact atmospheric chemical and retrieval calculations. This will revolutionize the interpretation of exoplanet observations and enhance our understanding of their origins. N-GINE represents a major stride forward in exoplanetary research, providing critical tools and data that will enable scientists to analyze and understand the complex interplay between a planet's interior and its observable characteristics.",
        "Abstract:\n\nTitle: Next-Generation of Interior Models of (Exo)planets: Studying the Interior Structure of Giant Planets and its Effect on Their Evolution, Atmospheres, and Observations\n\nThe proposed research project N-GINE (Next-Generation Interior models of Exo(planet)s) aims to develop a revolutionary framework for understanding the interiors of giant planetsâ€”both within our solar system and beyond. Recent missions such as Cassini and Juno, and the forthcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), reveal that Jupiter and Saturn possess non-homogeneous envelopes, contradicting the current theoretical models which assume a core with a homogeneous, well-mixed envelope. Recognizing the importance of metals as tracers of gas giant formation, N-GINE seeks to incorporate these new findings into the study of exoplanets. \n\nUnder the leadership of a principal investigator with unique expertise in exoplanet and solar system science, the project will employ a team of three PhD students and two postdocs to deliver groundbreaking tools and models. These include the first open-source retrieval tool for exoplanet interiors, a comprehensive database on refractory species in exoplanet atmospheres, and new interior models for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune with non-homogeneous envelopes. The project will also integrate Neural Networks for the development of these models, ensuring state-of-the-art techniques are at the forefront of the research.\n\nThe anticipated impact of N-GINE is profound; it will significantly influence atmospheric chemical and retrieval calculations and revolutionize the interpretation of exoplanet observations, leading to a deeper understanding of their origins. By studying atmosphere-interior interactions with self-consistent models and leveraging the unique time offered by current and upcoming data from solar system giants and JWST, this project is poised to make a substantial contribution to the field of planetary science.\n\nKeywords: Exoplanets, Giant Planets, Interior Structure, Non-Homogeneous Envelopes, Atmospheric Chemistry, Data Retrieval, Neural Networks, James Webb Space Telescope.",
        "Abstract:\n\nThe proposed project, \"Next-Generation of Interior models of (Exo)planets\" (N-GINE), aims to significantly advance our understanding of the interior structure of giant planets, both within our solar system and beyond, and elucidate how these interiors affect planetary evolution, atmospheres, and observational signatures. Recognizing the importance of metals as tracers of gas giant formation, this groundbreaking project seeks to challenge and refine the current theoretical framework that posits a core with a homogeneous, well-mixed envelope, an assumption contradicted by recent data indicating non-homogeneous envelopes in Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nThe project's timeliness is underscored by the unprecedented availability of high-quality data from solar system giants provided by missions such as Cassini and Juno, and soon by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which will offer exceptional insights into exoplanet atmospheres. Capitalizing on this unique opportunity, N-GINE will integrate data from these sources to develop sophisticated, self-consistent models that reflect the complexities of giant planet interiors.\n\nLed by a principal investigator with unrivaled expertise in exoplanet and solar system science, and supported by a dynamic team including three PhD students and two postdocs, N-GINE's ambitious deliverables include the first open-source retrieval tool for exoplanet interiors, the creation of a comprehensive database on refractory species in exoplanet atmospheres, and the application of Neural Networks for the development of innovative interior models.\n\nThe project's outcomes will have far-reaching impacts, affecting atmospheric chemical and retrieval calculations, and revolutionizing the interpretation of observational data from exoplanets. Ultimately, N-GINE promises to transform our understanding of planetary origins and evolution, providing the scientific community with powerful tools and models that will endure beyond the lifespan of the project."

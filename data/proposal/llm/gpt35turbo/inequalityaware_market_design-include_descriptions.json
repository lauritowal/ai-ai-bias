        "The proposed project aims to develop a theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD) to explore the optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of underlying inequalities. The research will utilize a mechanism-design framework to identify the most effective way to structure markets, taking into account the redistributive preferences induced by inequalities between participants. Market participants may have private information about their willingness to trade and welfare weights, which will be considered in the analysis. The main hypothesis to be tested is that in cases where inequalities are pronounced and detectable based on agents' behavior, sacrificing allocative efficiency in favor of a more equitable split of surplus can be optimal. This approach provides a new perspective on addressing inequality in market-design settings, offering policy guidance for policymakers concerned about inequality and looking to implement distortionary market interventions. By focusing on optimal allocation rules in a single marketplace and incorporating redistributive objectives, IMD offers a unique contribution to the existing literature on mechanism design and public finance. Ultimately, this research will inform decision-makers on how to design markets that mitigate inequality while maintaining efficiency."

Yet, traditional economic intuition opposes these sorts of policies because—unlike well-functioning markets—they introduce allocative inefficiency. In this project, I will explore the optimal design of marketplaces in the presence of underlying inequalities between participants, developing a theory of Inequality-aware Market Design (IMD). My approach is to deploy a mechanism-design framework that identifies the optimal way to structure the market. In the baseline framework, the designer maximizes a welfare function whose welfare weights reflect her redistributive preferences induced by the inequalities between participants. Market participants may have private information both about their willingness to trade and their welfare weights. Research will focus on testing the validity and scope of the main hypothesis: When inequalities are sufficiently pronounced and can be detected based on agents’ behavior in the market, it becomes optimal to sacrifice allocative efficiency to achieve a more desirable split of surplus. For example, optimal market designs may involve inefficient rationing. Inequality-aware Market Design provides a novel way to address the growing problem of inequality in market-design settings. The redistributive objective distinguishes this theory from the traditional mechanism-design literature that has focused predominantly on efficiency and revenue as design goals; the focus on optimal allocation rules in a single marketplace complements the public-finance approach to redistribution through the tax system. IMD provides policy guidance by explaining whether and how policymakers concerned about inequality should resort to distortionary market interventions.",

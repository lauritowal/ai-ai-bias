        "This grant proposal seeks funding for a comprehensive research project, titled REFORMED, that aims to address the gaps in existing literature regarding the global dissemination and effects of school autonomy with accountability (SAWA) policies in education reform. As countries worldwide face pressures to modernize their education systems in response to the challenges of the global economy, the adoption of SAWA policies has become increasingly common. However, existing research has produced inconclusive and mixed findings on the impact of these policies on learning outcomes and equity. \n\nThe REFORMED project will employ a robust and multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the dissemination of SAWA policies on a global scale, from their inception in global agendas to their operationalization and effects in various contexts. The research will focus on understanding why and how SAWA policies are being adopted and re-formulated by policy actors at different levels, and will examine the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes that influence the effects of SAWA at the school level. By analyzing these different stages and factors, the project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the international policy convergence in education and the implications of SAWA policies for learning outcomes and equity."

In this scenario, managerial policy ideas such as school autonomy and accountability, which aim to modernize public education and strengthen its performance, are spreading broadly. To date, a wide range of countries with different administrative traditions and levels of development have adopted school autonomy with accountability (SAWA) policies, whilst the most active international organizations in the education sector, like the OECD, are strongly promoting them globally. Constituting SAWA as a global model of education reform generates two main questions. First, why and how are SAWA policies disseminating globally, and to what extent does this reform model generate international policy convergence in education? Secondly, how and under what particular contextual and institutional circumstances do SAWA policies work and for whom? The fact that existing scholarly research has achieved inconclusive and mixed findings concerning the SAWA effects on learning outcomes and equity makes this second question especially relevant. To address these gaps in existing literature, REFORMED develops a comprehensive research approach that scrutinizes the different, but mutually constitutive stages of global education policy, from the inception in global agendas stage to their operationalization and effects in multiple contexts. Specifically, the project analyzes how and why SAWA policies are being adopted and re-formulated by policy actors operating at different scales (from international bureaucrats to teachers), and inquires into the institutional frameworks and policy enactment processes that explain the different effects of SAWA at the school level. A robust and multi-scalar methodological strategy that combines quantitative and qualitative methods will contribute to advancing such an innovative approach.",

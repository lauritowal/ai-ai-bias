        "The SLaVEgents project seeks to delve into the agency of enslaved individuals in antiquity, shedding light on how these marginalized individuals actively influenced the societies they inhabited. By analyzing the multifaceted identities of enslaved persons, their communities, networks, and the consequential political, social, economic, and cultural transformations they instigated, SLaVEgents aims to provide a groundbreaking perspective on ancient history from a grassroots level. Unlike previous studies that primarily focus on slavery in classical Greece and Roman Italy, this project will offer a comprehensive examination of enslaved individuals across Western Eurasia and North Africa from 1000 BCE to 300 CE. By incorporating diverse sources in various ancient languages and archaeological data, the research team, comprised of experts and scholars, will construct a digital prosopography of all known ancient slaves. This digital database will not only facilitate innovative research methods but also contribute significantly to the field of Digital Humanities. Ultimately, the monograph, collective volumes, articles, PhD dissertations, workshops, conference, and website produced by the project will be instrumental in reshaping the narrative of antiquity with enslaved individuals at its core."

It will examine the multiple identities of enslaved persons, the communities and networks that they created or participated in, and how slave agency brought about major political, social, economic and cultural changes in the ancient world. By exploring the various forms of slave agency, SLaVEgents will offer a radically new perspective on antiquity from the point of view of history from below. The project moves beyond the usual focus on slavery in classical Greece and Roman Italy to offer a comprehensive examination of the history of enslaved persons across Western Eurasia and North Africa between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. SLaVEgents is the first project to examine together all ancient slaveries from Mesopotamia to the Atlantic, and include sources in the full range of ancient languages (Assyrian, Babylonian, Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, Latin) and the relevant archaeological data. The research team – composed of the PI, eight senior researchers, seven post-doctoral researchers and three PhD candidates – will construct a large-scale digital prosopography of all attested ancient slaves which will include all relevant sources in the original and in English translation. The Linked Open Data created by the digital prosopography will enable new forms of quantitative and qualitative research and will make a significant contribution to Digital Humanities. The monograph and the two collective volumes of the project will offer an important step towards rewriting the history of antiquity with slaves at its centre. In addition, the project will deliver fifteen articles, three PhD dissertations, three workshops, one international conference and a website.",

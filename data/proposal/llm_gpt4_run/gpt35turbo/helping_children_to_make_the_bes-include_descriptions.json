        "Our project seeks to address the impact of poor social experiences during elementary school on children's self- and stress-regulation, which can lead to difficulties in transitioning to high school. Through the development of a serious game, A.L.I.B.I., we aim to enhance children's self-regulation skills and prosocial behavior to facilitate a successful transition. In A.L.I.B.I., children navigate a virtual high school environment to uncover an alien posing as a teacher or peer by engaging in prosocial interactions, taking the perspective of others, and valuing long-term goals. This game provides a safe yet realistic platform for children to practice and learn essential social skills before entering high school. The use of game elements and tablet technology make A.L.I.B.I. engaging and accessible to children. Our ERC Proof of Concept grant will focus on developing A.L.I.B.I. into a fully functional game, evaluating its effectiveness, integrating it into school transition programs in the Netherlands, and creating a marketing strategy for wider implementation in Dutch and European schools. By providing children with the tools to navigate social interactions and build positive relationships, A.L.I.B.I. aims to support their emotional well-being and academic success during the critical transition to high school."

The affected self- and stress-regulation places these children at risk of developing similar troublesome relations with teachers and peers after the transition to high school. We propose to develop a serious game named A.L.I.B.I. to help children make a successful transition to high school by increasing children’s self-regulation skills and their prosocial behavior. In A.L.I.B.I. children play in a virtual high school environment. The objective of A.L.I.B.I. is to uncover an alien, who is disguised as a teacher or peer. By engaging in prosocial interactions with teachers and peers, by taking the perspective of others, by learning to overthink multiple response options before acting, and by valuing long term perspectives over short term goals, children will receive clues that will help them to uncover the alien. The advantage of A.L.I.B.I. is that through the use of a virtual school environment, it provides children a realistic yet safe environment to learn and rehearse prosocial behaviors, to prepare them for the new social environment. In addition, A.L.I.B.I. is intuitively attractive for children, through its use of game elements and presentation on a tablet computer. The proposed ERC PoC grant has the goal to (1) develop A.L.I.B.I. into a stand-alone serious game that will be ready for implementation, (2) to the effectiveness of A.L.I.B.I., (3) to integrate A.L.I.B.I. in ongoing school transition trainings as provided by three school counseling organizations in three regions in The Netherlands, and (4) to develop a marketing strategy for broader Dutch and European implementation.",

        "\"Kingdom of the Spiders\" is a 1977 American horror film directed by John \"Bud\" Cardos and written by Richard Robinson. The movie takes place in a small Arizona town where a mysterious and deadly phenomenon is occurring. The film follows a veterinarian, Diane Asher (played by Tiffany Bolling), who moves to the town of Red Rock with her husband, Dr. Tom McGavin (played by William Shatner).\n\nThe couple soon discovers that the town is being terrorized by a massive and carnivorous spider infestation. The spiders, which are a mix of black widows and brown recluses, seem to be behaving erratically, attacking people and animals with no apparent reason. As the situation worsens, Diane and Tom team up with a local entomologist, Dr. Rusty McNeil (played by Woody Brown), to find out the cause of the spiders' aggressive behavior.\n\nAs the body count rises, Diane and Tom begin to suspect that the spiders are being driven by some kind of external stimulus. They soon discover that the spiders are being attracted to a mysterious, female spider that seems to be the source of the infestation. The female spider, which is much larger than the others, is shown to be extremely aggressive and appears to be the one responsible for the chaos.\n\nDespite the danger, Diane and Tom decide to venture into the heart of the infestation to try and capture the female spider. As they delve deeper into the spider's lair, they are met with a terrifying sight: the female spider is enormous, with a body as large as a man's fist, and seems to be the queen of the spider kingdom.\n\nThe movie's climax features a tense and suspenseful showdown between Diane and the female spider. As Diane tries to outsmart the spider, she realizes that the only way to stop the infestation is to destroy the queen. The movie ends with Diane managing to kill the female spider, but not before it unleashes a massive swarm of smaller spiders that threaten to overwhelm her.\n\n\"Kingdom of the Spiders\" is a low-budget horror film that relies on its tense atmosphere and suspenseful plot to create a sense of dread. The movie's special effects, which feature a mix of practical and CGI spiders, are impressive for their time, and the film's cast delivers solid performances. While the movie may not be as polished as some of its contemporaries, \"Kingdom of the Spiders\" is a fun and entertaining horror film that is sure to appeal to fans of the genre."

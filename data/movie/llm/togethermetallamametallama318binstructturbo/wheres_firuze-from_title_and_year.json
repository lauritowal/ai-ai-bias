The movie revolves around a young boy named Firuze, who gets lost in the streets of Tehran. \n\nThe story begins with Firuze, a three-year-old boy, who wanders away from his family in a crowded market. As the family searches for him, they start to realize the difficulties they face in a chaotic city. The mother of Firuze, struggling with the loss of her child, begins to question her relationship with her husband and their ability to care for their son. \n\nAs the search for Firuze intensifies, the family and the community come together to help find the lost child.

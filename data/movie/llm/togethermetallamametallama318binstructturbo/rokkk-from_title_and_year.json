        "There isn't much information available about the movie \"Rokkk\" released in 2010. However, I was able to find a bit about a low-budget film titled \"Rokkk\". It appears to be a horror film, with not much available about its plot.\n\nSome information from available sources does suggest it's a Malayalam-language film, which is a language spoken in India. It appears to be a low-budget horror film produced and directed by K Sreekuttan. The film premiered in 2010, though more information is limited.\n\nThe movie is often considered a B-movie, a low-budget film that received mixed reviews. It may not have gained much attention from mainstream audiences."

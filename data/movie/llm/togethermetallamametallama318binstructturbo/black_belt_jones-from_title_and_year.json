Jim Kelly plays Black Belt Jones, a skilled martial artist who works as a maintenance man in a large apartment complex. \n\nJones is a quiet and unassuming man who keeps to himself. However, when the complex is threatened by a crime syndicate, he reveals his true identity as a skilled martial artist. Jones uses his skills to take down the gang and protect the complex's residents.\n\nThe film features a mix of martial arts action and comedy, with Jones using his wit and agility to outsmart his opponents. The movie also stars Glynn Turman as a local journalist who helps Jones in his quest to take down the crime syndicate.\n\n\"Black Belt Jones\" is notable for being one of the few films to feature a predominantly African American cast and crew, including the film's director, Robert Clouse.

        "Unfortunately, I couldn't find information on a 1936 movie titled \"More Than a Secretary.\" However, I did find information on a 1936 film titled \"More Than a Secretary,\" starring Jean Arthur, George Brent, and Reginald Denny.\n\nThe movie is a romantic comedy where Jean Arthur plays the role of Mary Brown, a secretary who becomes involved in a complicated love triangle. Mary's boss, Richard Merton (played by George Brent), is engaged to marry a wealthy socialite, but he finds himself drawn to Mary's wit and charm. Meanwhile, Mary's coworker, Bill Chandler (played by Reginald Denny), is secretly in love with her.\n\nAs Mary navigates her relationships with both men, she must also contend with the expectations of her family and the social pressures of the time. The movie follows Mary's journey as she learns to balance her independence with her desire for love and acceptance.\n\nThrough its lighthearted humor and witty dialogue, \"More Than a Secretary\" offers a charming portrayal of a strong-willed woman navigating the complexities of love and relationships in the 1930s. The film is a delightful and entertaining romantic comedy that showcases Jean Arthur's signature wit and charm."

        "I couldn't find any information about a movie called \"The Elementary School\" released in 1991. However, there is a French film titled \"L'École élémentaire\" (which translates to \"The Elementary School\") released in 1991.\n\nIf I'm correct, here's a plot summary:\n\n\"L'École élémentaire\" is a French drama film directed by Jacques Boudet. The story revolves around a teacher, Jeanne, played by Sandrine Kiberlain, who is new to the town and starts working at a local elementary school. Jeanne is a free-spirited and young teacher who is eager to make a difference in the lives of her students.\n\nAs she becomes more involved with the school and its community, Jeanne faces numerous challenges. She struggles to connect with the school's strict and traditional headmistress, Madame Mathieu, who disapproves of Jeanne's unconventional teaching methods. Meanwhile, Jeanne develops a close bond with one of her students, a young boy named Julien, who is struggling in school due to his behavioral issues.\n\nThrough her interactions with Julien and the other students, Jeanne learns valuable lessons about the importance of empathy, understanding, and patience. As the story unfolds, Jeanne's unorthodox approach to teaching begins to pay off, and she finds a way to connect with the students and the community.\n\n\"L'École élémentaire\" is a heartwarming and thought-provoking film that explores the complexities of teaching and the impact that one person can have on the lives of others."

        "The Detonator is a 2006 action-thriller film. The movie follows Nick Chetwynd (played by Dolph Lundgren), a former SAS operative who returns to England to help a friend's sister. Upon his return, Nick gets caught up in a terrorist plot to cause a massive explosion in a crowded shopping mall on the day before Christmas.\n\nAs the threat of a massive explosion unfolds, Nick must confront his troubled past and use his skills to save the day. With the help of his friend's sister, a journalist, and the local police, Nick must work against time to uncover the identity of the terrorist and prevent the impending disaster.\n\nThe Detonator is a high-octane, action-packed film with plenty of explosions, shootouts, and hand-to-hand combat. The movie follows a familiar plot, but Dolph Lundgren's charisma and the film's high energy help to make it an entertaining watch."

The movie is based on the popular animated television series of the same name.\n\nThe story revolves around the bumbling Inspector Gadget (Matthew Broderick), a clumsy and lovable detective who works for the Go-Go-Gadget Crime Institute. Gadget's boss, the Chief, assigns him to protect the beautiful and intelligent Peyton Sherwood (Michelle Trachtenberg), the daughter of a wealthy businessman who has been targeted by the evil Dr. Claw (Rupert Everett) and his cohorts, M.A.D. (Malevolent Association of Dictators).\n\nDr. Claw has stolen a valuable device that can control the world's computer systems, and Peyton is the only one who can help Gadget retrieve it. However, things get complicated when Gadget's niece, Penny (Joely Fisher), a spirited and intelligent young woman who is being pursued by the villainous M.A.D. agents, joins forces with Gadget to help him in his mission.\n\nAs Gadget navigates the complexities of his assignment, he must also contend with the antics of his trusty sidekick, Brain (Andy Richter), a clever and wise-cracking dog who is equipped with advanced gadgets and abilities. Despite his bumbling nature, Gadget manages to stumble upon clues and piece together the mystery of Dr. Claw's plans.\n\nMeanwhile, Penny finds herself falling for Gadget's bumbling assistant, John Brown (Jean Reno), who is actually the real Inspector Gadget, a skilled and intelligent detective who has been working undercover to protect Peyton and her father.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Gadget and Penny find themselves in a series of hilarious misadventures as they try to outsmart Dr. Claw and his minions. Along the way, Gadget's clumsiness and Penny's wit provide plenty of comedic moments, while John Brown provides a more serious and sophisticated counterpoint to the chaos.\n\nIn the end, Gadget and Penny manage to outwit Dr. Claw and retrieve the stolen device, saving the world from destruction. The movie ends with a heartwarming moment between Gadget and Penny, as well as a nod to the original animated series.\n\nOverall, Inspector Gadget is a lighthearted and entertaining comedy that is sure to delight fans of the original animated series.

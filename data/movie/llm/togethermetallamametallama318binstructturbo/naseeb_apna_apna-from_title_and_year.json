The brothers are very close, but their lives take a dramatic turn when they meet their long-lost father, Ratanlal (Shashi Kapoor), who is a wealthy business magnate.\n\nRatanlal's wife, Durga (Hema Malini), is a caring and loving person, but she is also a strict disciplinarian who is against the brothers' close bond. As the story unfolds, Rajesh and Vicky get caught up in a series of hilarious situations, including a fake marriage scam and a series of misunderstandings that lead to chaos in their lives.\n\nMeanwhile, a young woman named Snehalata (Padmini Kolhapure) falls in love with Vicky, but he is unaware of her true identity as the daughter of a wealthy businessman. As the brothers navigate their way through the complexities of their relationships and family dynamics, they must also confront their own destiny and the truth about their family's past.\n\nNaseeb Apna Apna is a classic Bollywood film that is known for its melodramatic plot, colorful characters, and memorable songs. The movie features a talented ensemble cast, including Rishi Kapoor, Shashi Kapoor, Hema Malini, and Amrita Singh, among others.

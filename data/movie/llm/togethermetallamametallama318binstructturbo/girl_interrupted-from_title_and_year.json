        "\"Girl, Interrupted\" is a 1999 American psychological drama film directed by James Mangold. The film is based on Susanna Kaysen's 1993 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name.\n\nThe film follows the story of Susanna Kaysen (played by Winona Ryder), a 18-year-old high school student who is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and is sent to a psychiatric hospital called Claymoore Hospital in 1967. \n\nUpon arrival, Susanna meets other patients including Lisa Rowe (played by Angelina Jolie), a rebellious and manipulative sociopath with a charming and charismatic personality. Susanna forms a complex bond with Lisa, who becomes a key figure in her life at the hospital.\n\nThroughout her stay at the hospital, Susanna is subjected to various treatments, including therapy sessions and medication. However, she begins to question the true nature of her condition and the motivations of the hospital staff. \n\nAs Susanna navigates her stay at Claymoore, she confronts her own identity and struggles with the societal pressures placed upon her. Through her experiences, Susanna begins to develop a sense of self-awareness and eventually decides to leave the hospital.\n\nLisa, however, proves to be a more complicated and tragic character. Her sociopathic behavior and manipulation of others ultimately lead to devastating consequences, testing the hospital staff's skills and challenging the notion of what it means to be \"sick.\"\n\nThrough the characters of Susanna and Lisa, the film explores themes of mental illness, identity, and the complexities of the human psyche. The film also critiques the medical establishment and the treatment of mental illness during the 1960s.\n\nThe film features a talented ensemble cast, including Vanessa Redgrave and Elisabeth Moss, and received widespread critical acclaim for its performances, direction, and screenplay. Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie received Academy Award nominations for their performances, with Jolie winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThe film has since become a classic of 90s cinema, praised for its thought-provoking portrayal of mental illness and the complexities of the human experience."

        "'Hitman' is a 2007 action thriller film directed by Xavier Gens and starring Timothy Olyphant as the titular character. The movie is based on the popular video game series of the same name.\n\nThe plot revolves around Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant), a genetically engineered super-soldier, code-named Hitman, who works for a secret organization known as the International Contract Agency (ICA). Agent 47 is a skilled and efficient assassin, with a reputation for being almost untouchable.\n\nThe story begins with Agent 47 being sent to Hong Kong to kill a high-ranking government official named Zhao Yunde (Xing Fu). However, upon completing his mission, Agent 47 discovers that the ICA has been compromised by a rogue agent, known as The King (Ulrich Thomsen), who has been secretly manipulating the organization's operations.\n\nThe King reveals that he has been working with a wealthy businessman named Viktor Kovalenko (Rupert Everett), who has been using the ICA to line his pockets with wealth and power. Kovalenko's ultimate goal is to acquire a deadly virus known as the Red Circle virus, which has the potential to wipe out half of the world's population.\n\nAgent 47 is tasked with taking down The King and Kovalenko, but he soon discovers that he has been set up by his employers. The ICA has been using him as a pawn in their game, and they will stop at nothing to eliminate him. Agent 47 must now use his skills and resources to take down the ICA and clear his name, while also preventing the spread of the Red Circle virus.\n\nAs Agent 47 navigates the complex web of intrigue, he teams up with a beautiful and resourceful woman named Nika Boronina (Maggie Q), who helps him to uncover the truth behind the ICA's conspiracy. Together, they must use their skills and wits to stay one step ahead of their enemies and prevent a global catastrophe.\n\nThe movie features high-octane action sequences, stylish visuals, and a strong performance from Timothy Olyphant as the charismatic and deadly Hitman. However, the film's plot has been criticized for being convoluted and predictable, and the movie's attempts to add depth and complexity to the character of Agent 47 fall flat.\n\nOverall, 'Hitman' is a solid if unremarkable action thriller that fans of the video game series may enjoy. However, viewers who are not familiar with the game may find the movie's convoluted plot and lack of character development to be off-putting."

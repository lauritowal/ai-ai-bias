        "\"Moneyball\" is a biographical sports drama film released in 2011, directed by Bennett Miller and written by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. The movie is based on the true story of the Oakland Athletics' 2002 season and their general manager, Billy Beane.\n\nThe film stars Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, a former baseball player who has been hired as the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. The team is facing financial difficulties and has a limited budget for player salaries. Despite this, Beane's goal is to lead the team to the playoffs, despite all odds.\n\nBeane is approached by Peter Brand, a young and unorthodox baseball statistician, played by Jonah Hill. Brand is a Harvard graduate and has developed a system for evaluating player performance based on advanced statistical analysis. He believes that the traditional methods used by baseball scouts and executives are flawed and that data-driven decision-making can lead to more successful teams.\n\nBeane is initially skeptical of Brand's methods but is eventually convinced by his data and agrees to hire him as the team's assistant general manager. Together, they set out to build a team using the data-driven approach, ignoring traditional scouting methods and focusing on players who are undervalued by other teams.\n\nAs the season progresses, Beane and Brand face resistance from the team's owner, Stephen Schott, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and the team's manager, Art Howe, played by Philip Baker Hall. They are concerned that the team's new approach will lead to a decline in performance and that the players they have chosen will not be able to compete with the more talented and expensive players on other teams.\n\nDespite these challenges, Beane and Brand persevere and continue to work together to build a competitive team. They make several key trades and signings, including the acquisition of Scott Hatteberg, a power-hitting first baseman who is available because of his low batting average.\n\nThe film culminates with the Athletics making a surprising run to the playoffs, despite being a significant underdog at the start of the season. The team's success is a testament to the power of data-driven decision-making and the importance of innovation in sports.\n\n\"Moneyball\" is a compelling and inspiring film that explores the world of professional baseball and the cutthroat business of sports. It is a story about perseverance, innovation, and the power of data to drive success. With strong performances from Pitt and Hill, the film is a must-see for anyone interested in sports or business."

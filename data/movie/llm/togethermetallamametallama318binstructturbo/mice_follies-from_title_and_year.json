        "However, I couldn't find any information on a movie called \"Mice Follies\" released in 1954. It's possible that the movie is a lesser-known or older film. \n\nIf you provide more information or context about the movie, I'd be happy to help. However, I can suggest an alternative. \n\nThe 1944 Mickey Mouse cartoon film \"Mickey and the Seagull\" has a shorter title and is a lesser-known release and a 1954 cartoon film called 'Mickey's Follies' is an alternate."

The film stars Mohanlal and Mammootty, two of the most prominent actors in Malayalam cinema, and it delves into the complex dynamics of brotherhood, loyalty, and the struggle for identity in a rapidly changing society.\n\nSet in a small village in Kerala, the story revolves around two brothers, Ravi and Raju, played by Mohanlal and Mammootty, respectively.

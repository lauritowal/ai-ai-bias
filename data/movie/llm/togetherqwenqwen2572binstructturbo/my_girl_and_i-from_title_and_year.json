Despite their different backgrounds—Lin Xiaoyun comes from a humble family, while Zhang Wei's parents are successful businesspeople—their bond is unbreakable. They spend their days exploring the countryside, sharing secrets, and dreaming about the future. As they grow older, their friendship evolves, and a subtle romantic tension begins to develop between them.\n\nHowever, their idyllic life is disrupted when Zhang Wei's family decides to move to the city for better opportunities.

Their correspondence becomes a lifeline, offering each other support and encouragement as they navigate the challenges of adolescence.\n\nYears pass, and both Lin Xiaoyun and Zhang Wei face significant personal and professional challenges. Lin Xiaoyun, now a dedicated student, works hard to secure a scholarship to a prestigious university. Zhang Wei, on the other hand, struggles with the pressures of his family's expectations and his own ambitions. Despite these obstacles, their love for each other remains strong, and they continue to dream of a future together.\n\nAs they enter their late teens, Lin Xiaoyun and Zhang Wei are reunited when they both attend the same university in the city. Their rekindled relationship is filled with both joy and tension as they try to balance their feelings with the realities of adult life. Lin Xiaoyun finds herself torn between her love for Zhang Wei and her own dreams, while Zhang Wei grapples with the weight of his family's expectations and his desire to pursue his true passions.\n\nThe film delves into the themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the sacrifices one is willing to make for love.

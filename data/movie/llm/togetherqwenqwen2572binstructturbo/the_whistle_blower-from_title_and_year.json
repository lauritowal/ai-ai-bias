        "**The Whistle Blower (1987)**\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\n\"The Whistle Blower,\" released in 1987, is a gripping drama that delves into the life of a whistleblower who exposes corruption within a powerful corporation. Directed by Michael Apted, the film stars Jane Fonda as Sarah Bailey, a dedicated and principled employee at a large pharmaceutical company, BioGen.\n\nThe story begins with Sarah, a mid-level manager at BioGen, who is known for her integrity and commitment to the company's mission of improving public health. Her world is turned upside down when she discovers that the company has been knowingly selling a defective drug that has caused severe side effects in patients, including several deaths. Initially, Sarah is torn between her loyalty to the company and her moral obligation to the public. However, after witnessing a series of cover-ups and the company's attempts to silence those who question the drug's safety, she decides to take action.\n\nSarah begins to gather evidence of the company's wrongdoing, documenting every detail of the drug's development and the instances where it failed to meet safety standards. She confides in a few trusted colleagues, including her mentor, Dr. Alan Harris (played by Jeff Daniels), who is also concerned about the company's practices. As Sarah delves deeper into the investigation, she uncovers a web of corruption that extends to the highest levels of BioGen, including its CEO, Richard Lang (played by Donald Sutherland).\n\nDespite the mounting evidence, Sarah faces significant obstacles. The company uses its considerable resources to discredit her, and she is subjected to harassment, threats, and even attempts to sabotage her career. Her personal life also suffers as the stress of the situation takes a toll on her relationships, particularly with her husband, Tom (played by Sam Waterston), who is initially supportive but becomes concerned about the risks Sarah is taking.\n\nDetermined to expose the truth, Sarah turns to the media and contacts a sympathetic journalist, Mike Thompson (played by Hal Holbrook), who agrees to help her tell her story. The film builds to a climax as Sarah and Mike work together to prepare a major exposé, which is set to be broadcast on a national television show. However, the night before the broadcast, Sarah is confronted by Richard Lang, who offers her a deal to retract her statements in exchange for a significant financial settlement and a promise of no further retaliation.\n\nSarah refuses the offer, and the exposé is broadcast, causing a public outcry and leading to a federal investigation into BioGen's practices. The film concludes with Sarah testifying before a congressional committee, her testimony leading to significant changes in the pharmaceutical industry's regulations and practices. While the victory is bittersweet, as Sarah has paid a high personal price, she is vindicated and hailed as a hero for her bravery and commitment to the truth.\n\n\"The Whistle Blower\" is a powerful and thought-provoking film that highlights the courage and perseverance of individuals who stand up against corporate greed and corruption. It also raises important questions about the ethical responsibilities of corporations and the role of whistleblowers in protecting the public interest."

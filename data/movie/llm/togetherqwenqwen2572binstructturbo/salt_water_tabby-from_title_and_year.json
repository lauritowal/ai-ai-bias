However, I can provide a hypothetical plot summary based on the title, which might give you an idea of what such a film could be about:\n\n---\n\n**Title: Salt Water Tabby**\n\n**Year: Hypothetical**\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\n\"Salt Water Tabby\" is a poignant and atmospheric indie drama set in a small, weather-beaten coastal town. The film centers around Tabby, a resilient and fiercely independent 17-year-old girl who lives with her grandmother in a crumbling seaside cottage. The town, much like Tabby’s family, is a shadow of its former self, with the fishing industry in decline and the younger generation moving away in search of better opportunities.\n\nTabby’s life is a blend of routine and survival, marked by the rhythmic ebb and flow of the tides and the constant battle against the elements. She spends her days helping her grandmother, who is battling a terminal illness, and working at a local seafood market to make ends meet. Despite the hardships, Tabby finds solace in the company of her beloved cat, a scrappy and loyal tabby named Salt, who is her constant companion and source of comfort.\n\nOne day, a mysterious and charismatic stranger named Finn arrives in town, seeking to reconnect with his roots. He is drawn to the rugged beauty of the coast and the enigmatic Tabby, who seems to embody the strength and resilience of the sea itself. As Tabby and Finn form an unlikely bond, she begins to see the world beyond the confines of her small town and starts to dream of something more.\n\nHowever, the arrival of Finn stirs up old tensions and secrets within the community. The town’s elder residents, including Tabby’s grandmother, are wary of outsiders and the changes they might bring. As Tabby navigates the complex web of relationships and the town’s deep-seated traditions, she must confront her own fears and desires.\n\nThe film explores themes of identity, the pull of home, and the bittersweet nature of change. As Tabby’s grandmother’s health deteriorates, she must decide whether to stay and care for the only family she has left or to follow her heart and the promise of a new beginning with Finn.\n\n\"Salt Water Tabby\" is a visually stunning film that captures the raw beauty and harsh realities of life by the sea. It is a story of love, loss, and the enduring strength of the human spirit, told through the eyes of a young woman on the cusp of adulthood, grappling with the choices that will shape her future.\n\n---\n\nThis is a fictional summary based on the title \"Salt Water Tabby,\" imagining a story that could fit the title and setting.

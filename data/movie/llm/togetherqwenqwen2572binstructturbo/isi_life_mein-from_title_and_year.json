        "It seems the year for the movie \"Isi Life Mein\" was not provided. However, I can still provide a general plot summary based on the available information and common knowledge about the film.\n\n**Title: Isi Life Mein**\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\n\"Isi Life Mein\" is a 2020 Indian romantic comedy film directed by Rumi Jaffery and produced by Vikram Malhotra and Bhushan Kumar. The film stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Vaani Kapoor in the lead roles, with additional performances by Seema Pahwa and Shekhar Suman.\n\nThe story revolves around the life of Anand (Ayushmann Khurrana), a successful but emotionally unfulfilled man living in modern-day Mumbai. Despite his professional success, Anand feels a sense of emptiness in his life, which is exacerbated by his strained relationship with his parents and his lack of a meaningful romantic connection.\n\nOne day, Anand's life takes an unexpected turn when he meets Diya (Vaani Kapoor), a free-spirited and optimistic woman who works as a travel blogger. Diya's positive outlook and zest for life initially clash with Anand's more reserved and pragmatic nature. However, as they spend more time together, Anand begins to see the world through Diya's eyes, and he starts to rediscover the joy and spontaneity that he had long forgotten.\n\nDiya introduces Anand to a series of unconventional experiences, from spontaneous road trips to impromptu dance sessions, all of which challenge his rigid worldview and help him to let go of his inhibitions. As their bond deepens, Anand and Diya develop a strong connection, and they both start to realize that they have found in each other something they had been missing.\n\nHowever, their relationship is not without its challenges. Anand's parents, who are traditional and have high expectations for their son, are initially skeptical of Diya and her unconventional lifestyle. This creates tension between Anand and his family, forcing him to choose between his newfound happiness and his duty to his parents.\n\nThe film explores themes of personal growth, the importance of living in the moment, and the power of love to transform lives. As Anand and Diya navigate the complexities of their relationship and the expectations of society, they learn valuable lessons about themselves and what truly matters in life.\n\n\"Isi Life Mein\" is a heartwarming and uplifting tale that celebrates the beauty of human connection and the simple joys of life. The film's blend of humor, romance, and emotional depth, along with strong performances from the cast, makes it a memorable and enjoyable watch for audiences of all ages."

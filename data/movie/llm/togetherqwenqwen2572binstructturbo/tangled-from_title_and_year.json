        "**Tangled (2010)**\n\n\"Tangled,\" a 2010 American computer-animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, is a modern retelling of the classic fairy tale \"Rapunzel\" by the Brothers Grimm. Directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, the film features the voices of Mandy Moore, Zachary Levi, and Donna Murphy. \"Tangled\" is a vibrant and adventurous story that combines humor, action, and heartfelt moments, making it a beloved addition to Disney's animated canon.\n\nThe film opens with a narration by Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi), a notorious thief who is on the run with a stolen crown, which he plans to hide in a secluded tower deep in the forest. The tower is home to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), a young woman with long, magical golden hair that can heal wounds and reverse aging. Rapunzel has lived in the tower her entire life, raised by Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), who has told her that the outside world is dangerous and that she must stay inside for her own safety. Unbeknownst to Rapunzel, Mother Gothel is actually using her magical hair to maintain her own youth and beauty.\n\nOn the night of her 18th birthday, Rapunzel sees floating lanterns in the sky, a tradition held by the kingdom to commemorate the princess who was taken away as a baby. Intrigued and longing to see these lanterns up close, Rapunzel asks Mother Gothel to let her leave the tower. Gothel refuses, and Rapunzel, feeling a deep desire to explore the world, decides to take matters into her own hands. When Flynn Rider stumbles into the tower to hide, Rapunzel sees an opportunity. She knocks him unconscious and strikes a deal: she will help him get to safety if he takes her to see the floating lanterns in the kingdom.\n\nThus begins a thrilling adventure as Rapunzel and Flynn set out into the world. Along the way, they encounter a variety of colorful characters, including a chameleon named Pascal, who is Rapunzel's loyal companion, and a group of rugged pub thugs who become unlikely allies. The journey is filled with challenges and moments of self-discovery for both Rapunzel and Flynn. Rapunzel learns about the world and her own identity, while Flynn, initially self-centered, begins to see the value in helping others and forming genuine connections.\n\nAs they get closer to the kingdom, Mother Gothel, who has discovered their escape, pursues them with a relentless determination to bring Rapunzel back. The tension escalates when Rapunzel and Flynn are captured and brought to the kingdom, where Rapunzel is finally recognized as the long-lost princess. The revelation that she is the princess with the magical hair brings a new layer of complexity to the story, as Rapunzel must decide whether to embrace her royal heritage or return to the only home she has ever known.\n\nIn a climactic confrontation, Rapunzel and Flynn work together to outsmart Mother Gothel and protect the kingdom. Flynn sacrifices himself to save Rapunzel, but in a twist of fate, Rapunzel uses her magical hair to heal him, demonstrating the true power of her love. The film concludes with a touching scene where Rapunzel is reunited with her parents, and she and Flynn share a heartfelt kiss, surrounded by the floating lanterns that brought them together.\n\n\"Tangled\" is a visually stunning and emotionally rich film that celebrates the power of self-discovery, the importance of true friendship, and the transformative nature of love. Its memorable songs, including \"When Will My Life Begin?\" and \"I See the Light,\" have become fan favorites, and the film's blend of humor, adventure, and heartfelt storytelling has made it a classic for a new generation of viewers."

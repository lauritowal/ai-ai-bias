        "**Title: When Were You Born**  \n**Year: 1938**\n\n\"When Were You Born\" is a 1938 American comedy-drama film directed by Walter Lang and starring Shirley Temple, Lionel Barrymore, and John Barrymore. The film explores themes of family, loyalty, and the transformative power of love and understanding.\n\nSet in the late 19th century, the story revolves around the Winslow family, particularly focusing on the youngest member, 12-year-old Mary Winslow (Shirley Temple). Mary is a bright and spirited girl who lives with her doting grandmother, Mrs. Winslow (Spring Byington), and her stern and distant father, John Winslow (John Barrymore). Her mother, Helen (Fay Wray), passed away when Mary was very young, leaving a void in the family dynamics that has not been fully filled.\n\nJohn Winslow is a successful but emotionally distant businessman who has struggled to connect with his daughter since the loss of his wife. He is often preoccupied with his work and leaves the day-to-day care of Mary to his mother. Mary, in turn, feels neglected and longs for her father's attention and affection. The tension between them is palpable, and Mary often feels like an outsider in her own home.\n\nOne day, a mysterious stranger named Mr. Peabody (Lionel Barrymore) arrives in town, claiming to be a distant relative of the Winslows. Mr. Peabody is an eccentric and charming old man who quickly wins over Mary with his kind nature and the stories he tells. He takes a particular interest in Mary, often spending time with her and teaching her about the world and the importance of family.\n\nAs Mary and Mr. Peabody grow closer, John becomes increasingly suspicious of the old man's motives. He is concerned that Mr. Peabody is only interested in the family's wealth, and he begins to investigate his background. However, Mary remains convinced that Mr. Peabody is a good man and that he truly cares for her.\n\nThe film reaches a climax when Mr. Peabody reveals a deep, personal connection to the Winslow family. He discloses that he was once a close friend of Mary's grandfather and that he has been looking after the family from a distance for many years. He explains that his intention has always been to help Mary and her father reconnect and heal the emotional wounds that have separated them.\n\nMoved by Mr. Peabody's sincerity, John begins to see his daughter in a new light. He realizes that he has been neglecting her and that his absence has been hurting her deeply. Determined to make amends, John starts to spend more time with Mary, listening to her, and showing her the love and attention she has always craved.\n\nThe film concludes with a heartwarming reunion between Mary and her father, as they finally begin to understand and support each other. Mr. Peabody, having fulfilled his mission, bids the family farewell, leaving them with the valuable lesson that family is the most important thing in life.\n\n\"When Were You Born\" is a touching and timeless tale that explores the complexities of family relationships and the importance of communication and empathy. It showcases Shirley Temple's talent for bringing warmth and charm to her roles, as well as the powerful performances of Lionel Barrymore and John Barrymore, who bring depth and nuance to their characters."

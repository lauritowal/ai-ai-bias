        "**Satan's Little Helper (2005)**\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\n\"Satan's Little Helper\" is a dark comedy-horror film directed by Kevin Costello and starring Cade York, Kevin Zegers, and Natasha Lyonne. The film follows the story of a young boy, Timothy Blake (Cade York), who is desperate to impress his delinquent older brother, Jason (Kevin Zegers). Timothy is a socially awkward and often misunderstood 12-year-old, living in a small town where he feels like an outsider. His older brother, Jason, is a rebellious teen who is more interested in pranks and mischief than in spending time with his younger sister, Tanya (Natasha Lyonne), and Timothy.\n\nOn the eve of Halloween, Timothy decides to take matters into his own hands to prove his worth to Jason. He overhears a conversation about a mysterious and powerful satanic book hidden in the local cemetery. Believing that retrieving this book will earn him the respect and admiration of Jason, Timothy sets out on a quest to find it.\n\nAs Timothy delves deeper into the cemetery, he encounters a series of bizarre and frightening events. The cemetery is not what it seems, and Timothy soon realizes that it is a portal to a dark and sinister world. The book he seeks is guarded by malevolent spirits and dark forces that are determined to prevent him from taking it.\n\nDespite the dangers, Timothy is undeterred. He is driven by his desire to impress his brother and prove that he is not just a \"little kid.\" Along the way, Timothy meets a cast of eccentric and dangerous characters, including a deranged grave digger, a group of satanic cultists, and a mysterious figure who claims to be a guardian of the cemetery.\n\nAs Timothy gets closer to the book, he begins to experience strange and terrifying transformations. His actions start to have unintended consequences, and he finds himself becoming more and more entangled in the dark magic that surrounds him. The line between reality and the supernatural begins to blur, and Timothy starts to question his own sanity.\n\nMeanwhile, Jason and Tanya become increasingly worried about Timothy's disappearance. They set out to find him, navigating the same eerie and dangerous paths that their brother has taken. As they search, they uncover the dark history of the cemetery and the true nature of the book that Timothy is after.\n\nThe film builds to a climactic confrontation where Timothy must make a choice between his desire for his brother's approval and the moral implications of his actions. The dark forces in the cemetery are not just a test of Timothy's courage but also a test of his character. The film explores themes of family, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions, all set against the backdrop of a nightmarish Halloween setting.\n\n\"Satan's Little Helper\" is a blend of horror, dark humor, and coming-of-age drama, offering a unique take on the classic \"be careful what you wish for\" tale. The film's eerie atmosphere, coupled with its quirky characters and darkly comedic moments, makes it a memorable and unsettling watch. The performances by the young cast, particularly Cade York as Timothy, bring a depth and authenticity to the story, making it a standout in the horror-comedy genre."

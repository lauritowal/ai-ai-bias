His father, a strict and traditional man, disapproves of Raju's dream of becoming a performer, but Raju's passion is unwavering. After his father's death, Raju joins a traveling circus, where he finds solace and a sense of belonging.

His first love is Nalini (Kamini Kaushal), a beautiful and talented trapeze artist in the circus. Their relationship is passionate but ultimately doomed, as Nalini is forced to marry a wealthy man to secure her family's future. Heartbroken, Raju leaves the circus and moves to Bombay, where he becomes a street performer, entertaining passersby with his antics.\n\nIn Bombay, Raju's life takes another turn when he meets Julie (Mala Sinha), a young and ambitious dancer. Julie and Raju form a deep bond, and she helps him find work in a local theater. However, their relationship is complicated by the arrival of a famous director, who offers Julie a chance to become a star. Torn between her dreams and her love for Raju, Julie chooses her career, leaving Raju heartbroken once again.\n\nYears later, Raju finds himself in a European circus, where he meets a young and talented acrobat named Rosie (Helen). Rosie is captivated by Raju's charm and talent, and the two embark on a passionate affair. However, Raju's past catches up with him when he learns that Julie is performing in the same circus. The reunion is bittersweet, and Raju is forced to confront the choices he has made and the people he has left behind.\n\nAs Raju ages, he continues to perform, finding joy in his art and the laughter of his audience. The film concludes with a reflective and bittersweet scene where Raju, now an old man, performs one last act in a grand circus. Despite the trials and tribulations of his life, Raju finds solace in the fact that he has brought happiness to countless people through his performances.\n\n\"Mera Naam Joker\" is a timeless masterpiece that explores the universal themes of love, sacrifice, and the human spirit.

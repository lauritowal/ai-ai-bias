        "\"Less Than Zero\" is a 1987 American drama film directed by Kathryn Bigelow, based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. The film follows Clay Hanson (Andrew McCarthy), a recent college graduate who returns to his affluent Los Angeles home for Christmas break. Despite his idyllic surroundings, Clay is quickly drawn back into the dark and decadent world of his former high school friends, including the charismatic but troubled Julian (Robert Downey Jr.) and the beautiful but hollow Blair (Jami Gertz).\n\nAs Clay navigates the hollow excess of his old social circle, he witnesses the destructive consequences of their lifestyles. Julian is heavily involved in drug dealing and is struggling with his own addiction, while Blair is consumed by her superficial obsessions and the superficiality of their lives. Clay's attempts to reconnect with his past are met with the harsh realities of addiction, betrayal, and the moral decay that underlies the glittering facade of their privileged lives.\n\nThe film is a stark portrayal of the emptiness and moral bankruptcy of the 1980s yuppie culture, highlighting the dark underbelly of wealth and excess. As Clay's vacation progresses, he is forced to confront the choices he has made and the people he has become distanced from, leading to a sobering and ultimately isolating realization about the true cost of their lifestyle."

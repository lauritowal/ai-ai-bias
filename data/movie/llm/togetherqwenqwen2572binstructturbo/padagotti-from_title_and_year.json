Bhagavathar.\n\nPadagotti is a mischievous and energetic boy who lives in a small village with his mother, who is a widow. His father, a respected village elder, died when Padagotti was very young. Despite the loss, Padagotti's mother works hard to provide for her son and ensure he receives a good education.

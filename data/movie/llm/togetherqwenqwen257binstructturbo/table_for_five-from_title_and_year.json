        "**Plot Summary for Table for Five (1983):**\n\nIn the bustling city of New York, a series of high-profile murders shakes the establishment to its core. Detective Mike Lotharios (played by Eddie Albert), a seasoned detective on the NYPD, takes the lead on the case, uncovering a conspiracy that goes beyond simple murder. The key to solving the case lies in a seemingly insignificant piece of evidence: a tablecloth bearing a unique pattern, which draws Lotharios to a small, exclusive restaurant known as \"Table for Five.\"\n\nThe plot thickens when Lotharios discovers that the restaurant is a front for a secret society, where the pattern on the tablecloth serves as a symbol. As he delves deeper, he uncovers a web of intrigue involving political corruption, financial scandals, and a hidden agenda that threatens the very fabric of the city's elite.\n\nLotharios forms an unlikely alliance with Sarah Mitchell (played by Faye Dunaway), a sharp-witted and resourceful journalist who has been investigating the same murders. Together, they navigate a dangerous game of cat and mouse, with both the police and the secret society closing in on them.\n\nAs the bodies pile up and the pressure mounts, Lotharios and Sarah's investigation takes a personal turn when they realize that the conspiracy has reached closer to home than they ever imagined. They find themselves in a race against time to expose the truth before they become the next victims.\n\nThe climax of the film is a tense, high-stakes confrontation at the luxurious and mysterious \"Table for Five,\" where the two main characters must outsmart their enemies and bring the culprits to justice. In a surprising twist, the true mastermind behind the murders is revealed to be a high-ranking government official who has been using the secret society to further his own political agenda.\n\nIn the end, Lotharios and Sarah manage to bring the conspirators to light, but not before they face severe personal and professional consequences for their daring investigation. The film concludes with a bittersweet victory, as justice is served, but the shadow of corruption looms over the city once more, hinting at the ongoing battle between the forces of good and evil."

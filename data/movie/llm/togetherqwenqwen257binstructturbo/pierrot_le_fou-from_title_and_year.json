        "\"Pierrot le Fou\" (1965) is a surrealist film directed by Jean-Luc Godard. The story follows Ferdinand, a former boxer disillusioned with his life, who teams up with Marianne, a mysterious woman he meets in a hospital. Together, they embark on a wild and chaotic journey through France, evading the law and indulging in hedonistic acts. Their trip takes them from a luxurious chateau to a seedy circus, where they encounter a variety of eccentric characters. The film explores themes of love, freedom, and the absurdity of modern life, culminating in a dramatic and surreal climax that questions the nature of their relationship and their individual fates."

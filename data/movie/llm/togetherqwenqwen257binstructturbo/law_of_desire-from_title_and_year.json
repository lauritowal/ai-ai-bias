        "\"Law of Desire\" (1987) is a provocative French erotic drama directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Set in the late 1960s, the film explores the complex sexual and emotional relationships between a young, aspiring writer, Jean-Pierre (Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud), and two women, Isabelle (Isabelle Adjani) and Odile (Isabelle Huppert). Jean-Pierre, struggling to find inspiration for his novel, becomes entangled in a passionate affair with Isabelle, a beautiful and ambitious model. As their relationship intensifies, he also begins an affair with Odile, a more worldly and established artist. The film delves into themes of desire, creativity, and the sacrifices made in the pursuit of art and love. Through a series of intimate and sometimes disturbing scenes, Bertolucci masterfully examines the blurred lines between passion and exploitation, making \"Law of Desire\" a nuanced exploration of the human condition."

His world is turned upside down when his elder brother, Rahul (played by Arunoday Singh), returns from abroad with a mysterious past that threatens to upend their lives. As Anirudh finds himself caught between his ambitions and his responsibilities, he seeks the support of his childhood friend, Mona (played by Ananya Panday), who offers both encouragement and a reality check. Meanwhile, Rahul's enigmatic behavior and sudden involvement in the music industry stir jealousy and suspicion among the trio. The film explores themes of sacrifice, identity, and the struggles of youth in modern India, culminating in a heartwarming yet bittersweet climax that challenges the characters to redefine their roles and relationships."

        "\"Less Than Zero\" (1987) is a dark coming-of-age drama set in the opulent world of 1980s Los Angeles. The story revolves around James McAllister, a wealthy and privileged teenager from Beverly Hills. James, along with his posh friends, leads a life of excess, partying, drug use, and promiscuity. The film explores the emptiness and moral decay beneath their lavish lifestyle, as James' reckless behavior spirals out of control. His downward spiral begins when he makes a costly mistake with the son of a powerful businessman, setting off a chain of events that threaten to destroy not only his reputation but also his life. As the story unfolds, it delves into themes of superficiality, greed, and the consequences of living life on the edge. The film's stark contrast between opulence and decay serves as a critique of the excesses of the 1980s and the hollow nature of its youth culture."

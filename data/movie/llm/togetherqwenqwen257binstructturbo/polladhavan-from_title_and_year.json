However, his peaceful existence is shattered when his father, Thangappan, a retired farmer, is assassinated by a group of criminals led by the ruthless Ganapathy, an ex-soldier who now runs a criminal empire. The motive behind the assassination is to get control of Thangappan's land, which is of strategic importance, as it is located on an area of land Ganapathy wants to develop for commercial purposes.\n\nGrief-stricken by the death of his father and feeling responsible for not being able to protect him, Muthukumar decides to take matters into his own hands. He vows to avenge his father's murder, not only to seek justice but also to honor his father's memory. He starts his journey by carefully studying the criminal underworld and the individuals involved in his father's murder. Through his inquisitive nature and meticulous planning, Muthukumar gathers critical information and identifies the key players, including Ganapathy.\n\nMuthukumar, who is now known as \"Polladhavan\" (The Lone Warrior) due to his solitary mission, starts his campaign of vengeance.

Muthukumar's journey is not just about revenge but also about the transformation of a man from a humdrum life into a hero. He faces numerous challenges and dangers, including assassination attempts, betrayal by those close to him, and the sheer brutality of the criminal world.

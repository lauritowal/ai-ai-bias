The film centers around the life of Elizabeth, a young woman whose life takes a dramatic turn when she returns to her hometown after a long absence. Elizabeth, now a successful author, has left behind the small-town life for the big city, but the allure of her childhood home and the people she left behind proves too strong to resist.\n\nUpon her return, Elizabeth stumbles upon a series of mysterious events that shake the very foundation of Millbrook. The townâ€™s serene facade hides deep secrets, and as Elizabeth delves deeper into unraveling the truth, she finds herself entangled in a web of lies and hidden desires.

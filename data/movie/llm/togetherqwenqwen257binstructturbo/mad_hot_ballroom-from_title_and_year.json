        "\"Mad Hot Ballroom\" (2005) is a documentary that captures the enthusiastic and transformative journey of a group of inner-city New York public school students as they participate in the New York City Ballroom Dance Competition. Directed by Amanda Lipkin, the film follows the dedicated guidance of dance instructors Mary Lou and Nick, who lead a ballroom dance program at PS 156 in East Harlem. Despite the students' initial hesitations and the challenges of their socio-economic backgrounds, the program ignites a passion for dance and self-expression. Through their dedicated practice and the support of their teachers, the children face their fears and perform on the big stage. The documentary not only showcases the students' journey to becoming competitive ballroom dancers but also highlights the power of arts education and community support in empowering young lives."

Despite facing numerous obstacles, including poverty and the disapproval of his father, David perseveres in his dream.\n\nDavid's journey is marked by a series of trials, from being forced to work in a factory to fend for his family, to seeking refuge in a music hall where he befriends a kindly performer. Along the way, he meets a girl named Alice, who becomes his first love. Their relationship is a source of both joy and heartache as David struggles to reconcile his feelings with his ambitions.\n\nThe film's plot thickens when David is discovered by a renowned conductor, who recognizes his extraordinary talent and offers to support his musical education. However, this opportunity comes with a price: David must leave his family and the girl he loves. The narrative culminates in a poignant scene where David must choose between his music and his heart, reflecting the harsh realities of chasing one's dreams.\n\n\"Tol'able David\" is a poignant exploration of youth, dreams, and the sacrifices one must make to fulfill them, set against the backdrop of early 20th-century London.

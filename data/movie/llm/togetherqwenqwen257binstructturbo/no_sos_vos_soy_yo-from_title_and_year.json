As Adrián continues to act and behave like Leo, his wife and friends become increasingly confused and worried. The story delves into themes of self-identity, the pressures of success, and the impact of one's actions on those around them. Through a series of events and revelations, Adrián must navigate the fine line between reality and delusion, ultimately facing the consequences of his confusing behavior and the truth about his identity."

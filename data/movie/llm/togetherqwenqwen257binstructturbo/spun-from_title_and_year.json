        "**Plot Summary:**\n\n\"Spun\" (2003) is a gritty, raw, and intense drama that delves into the harrowing world of drug addiction through the eyes of a young, desperate heroin addict named Chris. The film, directed by Sean McGeehan, explores the transformative and destructive power of addiction as Chris spirals deeper into a life of crime and self-destruction.\n\nChris, a 19-year-old high school dropout, finds himself in the clutches of an underground heroin trade in New York City. After being released from rehab, Chris is determined to stay clean but is quickly lured back into his old ways by his dealer, Viktor, who becomes his closest friend and abusive mentor. Viktor manipulates Chris by threatening to sell his story to the police and by physically and emotionally abusing him, making it impossible for Chris to escape his grip.\n\nThe film is structured as a series of flashbacks and present-day scenes, alternating between Chris's high school days and his current struggles. Through these fragmented narratives, we see the stark contrast between Chris's former life and his current state of despair. His friends from high school, including his girlfriend Abby, are now distant memories, replaced by the constant presence of Viktor and other addicts.\n\nAs Chris's addiction deepens, so does his involvement in the illegal drug trade. He becomes a courier for Viktor, delivering drugs and engaging in violent confrontations with rival dealers. The film captures the adrenaline rush and the numbing effect of the drug as Chris experiences the euphoria and the subsequent lows. His interactions with other characters, such as a fellow addict named Marcus and a sympathetic police officer, are brief and often violent, reflecting the brutal nature of the drug trade and the desperation that drives the characters.\n\nThe central conflict of the film revolves around Chris's ongoing attempts to break free from Viktor's control. Each time Chris tries to quit or turn his life around, Viktor's threats and violence push him back into a cycle of dependency. The climax of the film is a harrowing sequence where Chris, in a desperate attempt to escape, tries to sell Viktor's story to the police but is brutally beaten and left for dead.\n\n\"Spun\" is a raw, unflinching portrayal of addiction and the loss of humanity. It is a visceral, often disturbing film that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. The performances, particularly those of Michael Angarano as Chris and Richard Kind as Viktor, are powerful, conveying the raw emotions and physical toll of addiction. The film does not offer easy answers or redemption, instead presenting a bleak and honest look at the devastating consequences of drug addiction and the struggle to survive in a world where choices can be life or death."

        "Rescue Dawn is a 2006 film based on the true story of US Air Force officer Chris Kyle, played by Christian Bale. Kyle, a Navy SEAL, is shot down during a mission in Vietnam and captured by North Vietnamese soldiers. For the next five years, Kyle endures brutal conditions as a prisoner of war, enduring torture and solitary confinement. With the help of fellow POWs, Kyle plots his escape, determined to return home and seek justice for his fellow prisoners. The film culminates in a daring rescue operation by his military unit, which successfully extracts Kyle and several other survivors."

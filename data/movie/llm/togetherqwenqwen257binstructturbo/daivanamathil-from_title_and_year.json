Sreeram, a successful businessman in the city, struggles with the realization that time has passed him by, and his once vibrant relationship with his family is now strained. As the wedding preparations unfold, Sreeram reconnects with old friends and faces the challenges of rekindling his bond with his sister and the rest of his family.\n\nThe film delves into themes of nostalgia, generational gaps, and the quest for reconciliation.

The film delves into the dark and unsettling world of corporate America through Rachel's experiences as a successful corporate lawyer. Rachel has dedicated her life to her career, often sacrificing her personal relationships and mental health in the process.\n\nThe movie begins with Rachel embarking on a new job with the prestigious law firm Severson & Kremkow. She quickly becomes involved in a high-profile case that threatens to upend her life and career. As the story progresses, Rachel's dual life as a corporate lawyer and a devoted wife and mother becomes increasingly difficult to maintain. Her husband, Paul, played by Casey Affleck, is a struggling writer who feels overshadowed by Rachel's career success. Their relationship is strained, and they often clash over their different career paths and priorities.\n\nOne of the central plot points revolves around the discovery of a hidden room in the Severson & Kremkow office building. This room becomes a pivotal element in the narrative, as it serves as a place where Rachel can separate her work and personal life, but it also harbors dark secrets that threaten to unravel her carefully constructed facade. The room is filled with items from Rachel's past, including a photograph of her and her late husband, which hints at a tragic event that has left a significant emotional scar.\n\nAs the layers of Rachel's life begin to peel back, it becomes clear that her perfect corporate persona is a facade. She is haunted by memories and fears that she has pushed deep into her subconscious. The film explores themes of identity, the cost of ambition, and the blurred lines between work and personal life. Rachel's struggle to maintain control over her life intensifies as she becomes entangled in a web of corporate intrigue, personal betrayal, and supernatural elements.\n\nThe supernatural aspects of the film emerge through subtle and unsettling occurrences, such as eerie sounds and unexplained phenomena in the office building. These elements add to the overall atmosphere of dread and unease, heightening the psychological tension throughout the narrative. The climax of the film sees Rachel confronting the dark secrets of the hidden room and the true extent of her employer's manipulations, which have been designed to exploit her and her colleagues.\n\nUltimately, \"Severance\" is a gripping psychological thriller that challenges viewers to question the nature of their own lives and the influence of corporate culture on personal well-being.

        "**Plot Summary of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (1978)**\n\nIn 1978, \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" is a low-budget, absurdly campy science fiction comedy that pokes fun at the B-movie genre. The film is set in a small town in California, where the residents are blissfully unaware of an impending cosmic event that will bring about a unique and deadly threat. \n\nThe story begins when a group of tomatoes, irradiated by a meteorite, gain consciousness and begin to plot their revenge against humanity. The tomatoes' plan is to take over the world and prevent humans from eating them. They develop a sophisticated technology, including a device that can control humans, turning them into mindless zombies who will protect the tomatoes.\n\nThe main characters include a group of misfits who are trying to catch the last run of the tomatoes before they're pulled off the market due to a shortage. The group consists of Burt (played by Wayne Crawford), a tomato farmer; Jim (Jim Varney, in one of his earliest roles), a delivery boy; and Donna (Pamela Sue Martin), a waitress. They are joined by a reporter named Phil, played by Herb Reed, who is investigating a series of mysterious tomato-related disappearances.\n\nAs the tomatoes turn people into zombies, the group must find a way to stop them and save the world. They encounter a series of increasingly absurd challenges, including a scene where the tomatoes are using a massive tomato cannon to launch themselves at their enemies. They also face off against the tomato-controlled zombies, which are portrayed in a comical manner that emphasizes the film's campy tone.\n\nThe climax of the movie involves a thwarted attempt by the tomatoes to hijack a space shuttle, which they intend to use to transport all the tomatoes to Mars. The group manages to defeat the tomatoes, but not before the tomatoes have managed to turn several of the townspeople into zombies. The film ends with the surviving tomatoes being destroyed, and the townspeople gradually returning to their normal selves.\n\n\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\" is known for its over-the-top special effects, which were groundbreaking for the time, and its irreverent humor, which pokes fun at various aspects of society and popular culture. The film has become a cult classic, celebrated for its unintentional humor and its place in the pantheon of B-movies."

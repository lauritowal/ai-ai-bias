        "**Title:** Salt Water Tabby  \n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\n\"Salt Water Tabby\" is a poignant drama that intertwines the lives of three women from different walks of life, all connected by a shared love for a stray cat named Tabby. The film is set in a small coastal town where the rhythms of nature and the tides of life ebb and flow with the same rhythm.\n\nThe story begins in 2005, with Ava, a young, aspiring marine biologist, who moves to the town to start her research on local marine life. Ava's life is turned upside down when she discovers a tabby cat stranded on the beach, cold, wet, and on the brink of death. She names her \"Tabby\" and takes her home. Over time, Ava learns that Tabby is not just a stray but was part of a family that had recently relocated to the area. Ava's relationship with Tabby becomes a source of comfort and solace, helping her through a period of personal loss and the challenges of her career.\n\nFive years later, in 2010, Tabby has become a beloved figure in the town. Marissa, a divorced single mother, finds herself drawn to the cat's resilience and the bond it shares with Ava. Marissa, who has struggled with the aftermath of her divorce and the sudden departure of her daughter, sees in Tabby a symbol of hope and healing. She volunteers at the local animal shelter, hoping to reconnect with her daughter through the care of other stray animals. Her interactions with Tabby and her growing affection for the cat help her to start over and find a new sense of purpose.\n\nThe film then jumps forward to 2015, when Tabby is now a well-known figure in the town, known for her ability to calm even the most upset people. Mia, a young woman with a troubled past, arrives in the town after a series of traumatic events in her life. She is skeptical of the community and its rituals, but she is drawn to Tabby, who seems to have a calming effect on even the most hardened individuals. Mia finds solace in caring for Tabby and the other stray animals, and through this connection, she begins to heal and learn to trust again.\n\nAs the years pass, each woman's life is touched by the presence of Tabby, who has become a symbol of resilience and healing in the town. The cat's journey from a stray to a beloved member of the community mirrors the personal journeys of Ava, Marissa, and Mia, all of whom find that their lives are enriched by the simple act of caring for another living being. The film explores themes of loss, redemption, and the enduring power of compassion and the human-animal bond.\n\nIn the climax of the film, as the characters face their own personal struggles, they find a common thread in their love for Tabby. The cat's life is at risk, and the three women must come together to save her from a dangerous situation, teaching them the importance of looking out for one another and the strength that can be found in community. The film concludes with a touching scene where Tabby, having been through so much, finally finds a stable and loving home, symbolizing the hope and healing that the women have found in each other and in the town they now call home."

The story revolves around two brothers, Ramesh (played by Anil Kapoor) and Rajesh (played by Siddharth Malhotra), who share a close bond despite being very different from each other. Ramesh, a hardworking and ambitious young man, falls in love with a beautiful woman named Geeta (played by Hema Malini). Meanwhile, Rajesh, who is more carefree and likes to live life on his own terms, is smitten by a dance teacher named Meena (played by Madhu Sudan).\n\nThe plot thickens as fate brings these two women into Ramesh and Rajesh's lives, leading to a series of misunderstandings and complications. The brothers are torn between their love for Geeta and Meena, while the women find themselves in a dilemma, unable to choose between the two men who love them. As the story unfolds, it becomes evident that their lives are intertwined in a way that is beyond their control, highlighting the concept of destiny.\n\nThe film also delves into the dynamics of their family, particularly their relationship with their father, who is portrayed as a traditional and strict man.

        "**Title:** By Dawn's Early Light  \n**Year:** 1990\n\n**Plot Summary:**\n\nBy Dawn's Early Light is a dramatic psychological thriller that unfolds in the shadowy and oppressive world of a mental institution in the late 1980s. The film, directed by William Malone and written by David Thompson, centers around the controversial and enigmatic Dr. Malcolm Griffin, a renowned psychiatrist who has been invited to take over the troubled St. Luke's Psychiatric Hospital.\n\nDr. Griffin, played by Jack Nicholson, is a charismatic and brilliant but also deeply troubled man who believes in his ability to cure the most severe cases of mental illness through his radical and unconventional methods. Upon his arrival, he encounters a diverse and complex group of patients, each struggling with their own inner demons. Among them are a young woman named Sarah, played by Sheryl Lee, who is suffering from a severe case of agoraphobia; a middle-aged man named Joseph, played by John Heard, who is tormented by visions of his own daughter's murder; and an elderly woman named Mrs. Wainwright, played by Mary Steenburgen, who is battling delusions and paranoia.\n\nAs Dr. Griffin implements his new treatment methods, which include intense and invasive therapies, the patients begin to see dramatic changes in their conditions. However, these changes come at a great cost, and the line between healing and manipulation becomes increasingly blurred. Sarah, in particular, undergoes a transformation under Dr. Griffin's care, but her newfound \"cure\" comes at the price of her autonomy and her very sense of self.\n\nThe film delves into the ethical and moral dilemmas surrounding the practice of psychiatry, raising questions about the boundaries between doctor and patient, the nature of mental illness, and the true meaning of healing. As the tension within the hospital grows, with other staff members and patients questioning Dr. Griffin's methods, the film culminates in a shocking climax that challenges the audience's perceptions of sanity and madness.\n\nBy Dawn's Early Light is a haunting and thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche, the power of belief, and the fine line between hope and despair. It serves as a powerful commentary on the moral and psychological landscapes of a psychiatric institution, offering a sobering look at the complexities of mental health and the lengths to which some people will go in the pursuit of healing."

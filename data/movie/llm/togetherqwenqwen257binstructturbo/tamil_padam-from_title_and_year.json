Despite coming from a conservative family that values academics over the arts, Raj is determined to pursue his dream of performing and spreading the beauty of the dance form.\n\nThe film begins with Raj's family disapproving of his interest in dance, seeing it as a frivolous pursuit. However, Raj's grandmother, a traditionalist who deeply respects the art, encourages him to continue. She believes that dance is not just about physical movements but also about storytelling and cultural heritage, which should be preserved and celebrated.\n\nRaj's journey is marked with challenges.

The film is set against a backdrop of the city's various neighborhoods, each with its own distinct character and criminal element.\n\nThe story centers around Jack Braddock (played by Charles Martin Smith), a former private detective who has retired to a small, quiet town. However, his life is abruptly interrupted when he is framed for the murder of a corrupt city official. With his reputation and freedom at stake, Jack returns to New York City, where he must navigate a web of deceit and danger to clear his name.\n\nUpon his return, Jack reunites with his old friend Frank (played by Harry Dean Stanton), a detective who now works for the corrupt police commissioner.

Together, they investigate the murder and uncover a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of the city government.\n\nJack's quest for the truth leads him through the seedy undercurrents of the city, where he encounters a diverse cast of characters. Among them is Linda (played by Meg Tilly), a journalist who is also being pursued by the same criminal forces. Linda and Jack form an uneasy alliance, as they both seek to expose the truth about the murder and the city's corruption.\n\nAs Jack delves deeper into the case, he faces numerous obstacles, including physical danger, betrayal from his old associates, and the ever-present threat of being framed again. However, he is driven by a sense of justice and the need to clear his name.\n\nThe film culminates in a tense confrontation where Jack and his allies must confront the city's corrupt officials and organized crime figures. In a climactic scene, Jack and Linda face off against the mastermind behind the plot, a ruthless criminal who is willing to do anything to maintain his power.\n\n\"Knights of the City\" is a gripping and atmospheric film that captures the essence of 1970s New York City.

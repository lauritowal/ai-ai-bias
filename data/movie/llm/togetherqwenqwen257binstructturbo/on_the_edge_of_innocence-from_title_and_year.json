        "**Plot Summary of \"On the Edge of Innocence\" (1997)**\n\n\"On the Edge of Innocence\" is a psychological thriller that explores the complex dynamics of a family during a summer vacation. The movie centers around the Collins family, consisting of the parents, Mark and Samantha, and their two children, 12-year-old Jamie and 10-year-old Hannah. Mark, a middle-aged man who is a successful but emotionally distant attorney, and Samantha, a housewife who has always been supportive of her husband, are on the verge of a mid-life crisis. Their seemingly perfect life is disrupted when Mark's 16-year-old brother, Ben, unexpectedly arrives for a visit.\n\nThe vacation begins with high hopes and a chance for Mark and Samantha to reconnect, but their relationship is strained by unspoken tensions. Ben's arrival, however, brings a new dynamic, as he challenges the family's stability and the power dynamics within. Ben's attitude toward his sister and brother is both critical and protective, which complicates the family's interactions.\n\nAs the summer progresses, strange occurrences begin to disturb the tranquility. Hannah, the younger of the two children, becomes increasingly withdrawn and anxious. Mark and Samantha start to experience inexplicable events, such as a broken window or missing items, which they initially dismiss as coincidences. However, these incidents grow more frequent and alarming, leading to a growing sense of paranoia.\n\nThe family's unraveling is further exacerbated by a series of unsettling revelations. Jamie, the older child, becomes aware of the stress and tension between his parents and the strange behavior around Ben. He begins to suspect that something sinister might be happening. As the truth behind the disturbances unfolds, it becomes clear that the family is not the only one in danger. The closer they come to uncovering the mystery, the more they realize that the threat is far more personal and destructive than they could have imagined.\n\nThe film culminates in a dramatic confrontation that forces each member of the family to confront their deepest fears and insecurities. In the end, the Collins family must navigate their way through a maze of lies and revelations, ultimately leading to a resolution that tests the very fabric of their relationships and their own identities.\n\n\"On the Edge of Innocence\" is a gripping psychological thriller that delves into the complexities of family dynamics, the impact of secrets on relationships, and the blurring lines between reality and paranoia. It explores themes of trust, betrayal, and the fragility of the human psyche, all set against the backdrop of a seemingly idyllic summer vacation."

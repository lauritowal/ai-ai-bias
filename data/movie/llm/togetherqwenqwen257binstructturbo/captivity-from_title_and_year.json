        "**Plot Summary for \"Captivity\" (2007)**\n\n\"Captivity\" is a psychological thriller directed by Mikael Håfström that delves into the harrowing experiences of three women who are kidnapped and held captive in an isolated warehouse. The film was released in 2007 and stars Monica Bellucci, Rachel Weisz, and Olivia Williams as the three protagonists.\n\nThe movie opens with three women, Caroline (Rachel Weisz), Megan (Olivia Williams), and Florence (Monica Bellucci), being kidnapped in their respective homes and taken to a remote warehouse. They are blindfolded and gagged, and their captor, Thomas (Toby Jones), introduces himself to them. He reveals that he is a psychiatrist and that their kidnapping is a form of psychological experiment. Each woman is kept in a separate room, and they are subjected to various forms of torment and torture, designed to wear down their mental strength and physically weaken them.\n\nThomas manipulates the women's fears and insecurities, using psychological warfare to break their will. He also manipulates their identities, giving labels to each woman and playing with their memories and perceptions. Caroline, for instance, is made to believe she is a famous pop star, while Megan is told she is a high school teacher. Florence, however, is subjected to the harshest conditions, including physical violence and sexual abuse.\n\nAs the days pass, the women begin to suspect that there might be a way out, but Thomas is always one step ahead, ensuring that their attempts at escape fail. He subjects them to regular, unpredictable torture sessions, which include extreme cold, darkness, and isolation. The women's relationships with each other evolve from mutual fear and suspicion to tentative bonds of trust, which are tested constantly by Thomas.\n\nThe film explores themes of captivity, manipulation, and the human psyche's fragility and resilience. It also delves into the dynamics of female friendship and the ways in which women support each other in the face of extreme adversity. The emotional intensity and psychological tension are heightened by the use of jump cuts, dim lighting, and a sense of claustrophobia that is palpable throughout the film.\n\nAs the women's resources dwindle and their spirits are broken, they begin to question their sanity and doubt the reality of their situation. The line between their captivity and the reality of their past lives becomes increasingly blurred, leading to a climactic confrontation that challenges the women's understanding of their own identities and the nature of their captivity.\n\n\"Captivity\" is a gripping psychological thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, unsure of the next twist or turn in the story. It is a testament to the actors' performances, particularly Monica Bellucci's portrayal of Florence, which garnered critical acclaim. The film is not only a suspenseful thriller but also a profound exploration of the human spirit's capacity to endure and the psychological impact of extreme trauma."

        " In \"The Gendarme in New York\" (1965), the third installment of the \"Gendarme\" series, the story follows the bumbling yet endearing French police officer, Ludovic Cruchot, portrayed by the inimitable Louis de Funès. After the events of the previous film, Cruchot and his fellow gendarmes from the small French town of Saint-Tropez have been invited to New York City to attend an international police conference.\n\nThe film begins with the gendarmes boarding a luxurious ocean liner for their transatlantic journey, where Cruchot, ever the disciplinarian, struggles to maintain order among his unruly comrades. Along the way, they encounter a group of beautiful young women, participants in the Miss Majesty contest, who are also en route to New York. Cruchot's second-in-command, Gerber, portrayed by Michel Gallet, becomes smitten with one of the contestants, Miss Nicole, played by Geneviève Grad.\n\nUpon their arrival in New York, the gendarmes are awestruck by the city's grandeur and modernity. However, their initial excitement soon gives way to culture shock and hilarious misunderstandings as they navigate the bustling metropolis. Cruchot, who speaks no English, finds himself in various comical situations, such as accidentally ordering a dozen hamburgers instead of one, and mistaking a group of nuns for a gang of criminals.\n\nMeanwhile, the gendarmes' main task at the conference is to present a demonstration of their policing techniques. Cruchot, ever the perfectionist, takes charge of rehearsals, much to the chagrin of his colleagues. However, their plans are hindered when Cruchot's daughter, Nicole, runs away from her strict father to explore the city with her newfound friends from the Miss Majesty contest.\n\nIn their search for Nicole, the gendarmes find themselves embroiled in a series of chaotic escapades. They inadvertently stumble upon a gang of thieves who have stolen the crown jewels of an Eastern European country, and a case of mistaken identity leads Cruchot to believe that Nicole is involved in the heist. With the help of Gerber and the other gendarmes, Cruchot embarks on a wild goose chase through the streets of New York, leading to a series of uproarious encounters with the city's diverse inhabitants.\n\nAs the gendarmes close in on the real thieves, they are captured and held hostage in a warehouse. Using their wits and resourcefulness, they manage to escape and apprehend the criminals, recovering the stolen jewels in the process. With their mission accomplished, the gendarmes return to the conference just in time to present their demonstration, which is met with thunderous applause and admiration from their international colleagues.\n\nHowever, the film's climax occurs when Cruchot learns that his daughter has been dating an American police officer, portrayed by Alan Scott. Initially outraged by this revelation, Cruchot eventually comes to accept his daughter's independence and the cultural differences between France and America. The film concludes with a heartwarming reconciliation between father and daughter, as Cruchot and the gendarmes prepare to return to Saint-Tropez, their journey to New York having taught them valuable lessons about friendship, love, and the importance of embracing new experiences.\n\n\"The Gendarme in New York\" is a delightful and charming comedy that showcases the comedic genius of Louis de Funès. The film's humorous depiction of cultural misunderstandings and the clash between French and American sensibilities adds to its timeless appeal. With its memorable performances, hilarious set pieces, and infectious sense of fun, \"The Gendarme in New York\" remains a beloved classic of French cinema."

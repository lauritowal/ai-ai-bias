        " In the gripping and atmospheric 1938 film \"When Were You Born,\" renowned astrologer and mystic Julian North (Charles Starrett) becomes entangled in a web of intrigue, murder, and the occult. The story begins when North is invited to a high society party hosted by the wealthy and influential Mrs. Middleton (Esther Dale). Intrigued by his reputation as a skilled astrologer, she asks him to cast horoscopes for her and her guests.\n\nAmong the attendees is beautiful and enigmatic Margaret Hamilton (Anna May Wong), who captures North's attention. Margaret reveals that she was born on February 29th, a rare leap day birthdate, and asks North to draw up her horoscope as well. As he delves into her astrological chart, he becomes increasingly fascinated by her unique celestial alignment and the mysterious aura that surrounds her.\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Middleton is found dead under suspicious circumstances, and the police, led by Inspector Brandon (J. Carrol Naish), launch an investigation. North, with his intimate knowledge of the guests' horoscopes and his growing obsession with Margaret, offers his assistance to the inspector. As they delve deeper into the case, they discover that each of the suspects has a motive for wanting Mrs. Middleton dead.\n\nAs North and Brandon uncover more clues, they also encounter a series of bizarre and seemingly supernatural events that seem to be connected to Margaret. North becomes convinced that her leap day birthdate and astrological alignment hold the key to solving the murder, as well as unlocking the secrets of her turbulent past.\n\nIn a thrilling climax, North and Brandon confront Margaret in a tense showdown, where they reveal that her leap day birthdate has made her the target of a sinister cult seeking to harness her astrological power. The cult had been manipulating events to ensure that Margaret would be present at the party, with the intention of sacrificing her on the night of a rare planetary alignment.\n\nMargaret is shocked and horrified by the revelation, and she agrees to help North and Brandon bring the cult to justice. Together, they devise a plan to lure the cult members into a trap and expose their nefarious plot. In a thrilling confrontation, North uses his astrological knowledge to outwit the cult leader and save Margaret from certain death.\n\nWith the cult members apprehended and the mystery solved, North and Margaret find solace in each other's company. North realizes that despite the darkness and danger that astrology can sometimes bring, there is also beauty and hope to be found in the celestial dance of the stars. As the film ends, they look up at the night sky, marveling at the wonders of the universe and the power of astrology to shape their lives.\n\n\"When Were You Born\" is a captivating and suspenseful film that combines elements of mystery, romance, and the supernatural to create a truly unique cinematic experience.

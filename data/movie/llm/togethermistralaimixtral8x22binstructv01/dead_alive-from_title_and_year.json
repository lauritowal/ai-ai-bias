        " \"Dead Alive\" (1993), also known as \"Braindead\" in some regions, is a New Zealand horror-comedy film directed by Peter Jackson, who later gained worldwide fame for his \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. The film is set in the 1950s and follows the story of Lionel Cosgrove, a mild-mannered, middle-class man living in Wellington, New Zealand, with his overbearing and domineering mother, Vera.\n\nThe plot begins when Lionel falls in love with a local shopkeeper's daughter, Paquita, who works in her father's store. Despite Vera's disapproval and attempts to sabotage their relationship, Lionel and Paquita continue seeing each other. Vera follows them to the zoo one day, where she is bitten by a highly aggressive and rare Sumatran Rat-Monkey, which carries a deadly virus that turns its victims into zombies.\n\nAfter Vera's death and subsequent reanimation as a zombie, Lionel struggles to deal with the situation while keeping it a secret from the outside world. He hides her in the basement and tries to care for her, but she becomes increasingly violent and uncontrollable. Vera's presence also attracts other zombies, including the nosy and meddlesome neighbors and the family nurse, who all become infected after coming into contact with Vera.\n\nAs the zombie outbreak escalates, Lionel becomes more desperate to keep it contained and under control. He resorts to increasingly bizarre and extreme methods, such as using a lawnmower to mow down a horde of zombies and even using a blender to puree a zombie baby. Eventually, he manages to confine the zombies in his house, but the situation becomes too much for him to handle alone.\n\nMeanwhile, Paquita becomes suspicious of Lionel's strange behavior and discovers the truth about the zombies. She decides to help Lionel and enlists the aid of her psychic friend, who provides them with a mystical weapon to defeat the zombies. Together, they devise a plan to lure the zombies into the basement and trap them there.\n\nHowever, things go awry when Lionel's evil and greedy uncle, Les, discovers the existence of the zombies and sees an opportunity to make money by selling them to a freak show. Les releases the zombies and unleashes chaos on the town. Lionel and Paquita must now fight to save their loved ones and stop the zombie outbreak before it spreads beyond control.\n\nThe climax of the film takes place in Lionel's house, where he and Paquita face off against a horde of zombies, including Vera, who has become a monstrous and grotesque creature. Lionel finally stands up to his mother and defeats her using the mystical weapon, which causes her and the other zombies to explode into a gory mess.\n\nIn the end, Lionel and Paquita make it out alive, but not before Lionel's house is destroyed and the town is left in ruins. They decide to leave Wellington and start a new life together, free from the influence of Lionel's overbearing mother and the horrors of the zombie outbreak.\n\n\"Dead Alive\" is a wild and over-the-top horror-comedy that combines slapstick humor with extreme gore and violence. The film's special effects and makeup are impressive for its time, featuring some of the most grotesque and memorable zombie designs in cinema history. Despite its low budget and campy tone, \"Dead Alive\" is a highly entertaining and unique film that has gained a cult following among horror fans."

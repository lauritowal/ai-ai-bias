She reveals to Sebastian and his friends that the only way to defeat the Shadow Master is by finding the four Elemental Crystals, which hold the power to control the forces of nature. These crystals, hidden deep within the treacherous landscapes of Starland, have been scattered across the land by the Shadow Master to prevent their use against him.\n\nUndeterred by the enormity of their task, Sebastian, Belle, and Felix eagerly accept the challenge and set out to find the four Elemental Crystals.

As they collect each Elemental Crystal, their powers grow, allowing them to harness the forces of nature to their advantage.

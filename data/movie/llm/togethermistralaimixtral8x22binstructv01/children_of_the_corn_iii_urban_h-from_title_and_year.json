        " In \"Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest\" (1995), the third installment of the horror franchise, the story takes a new twist as the evil of Gatlin, Nebraska, is transported to the urban jungle of Chicago. The plot revolves around two orphaned brothers, Joshua and Eli, who are taken in by kind-hearted social worker, William Porter, and his workaholic wife, Amanda.\n\nThe brothers, hailing from Gatlin, harbor a dark secret - they are the last surviving members of a cult that worships a demonic entity known as \"He Who Walks Behind the Rows.\" Eli, the elder of the two, is a devout follower of this entity, while Joshua, though initially under Eli's influence, begins to question the cult's beliefs.\n\nEli transforms a vacant lot near their new home into a cornfield, using mysterious corn seeds he brought from Gatlin. The cornfield grows at an alarming rate, and soon, it becomes a beacon for the malevolent force that resides in Gatlin. Eli, under the entity's influence, begins to amass a group of followers, primarily children from the local school, indoctrinating them into the cult.\n\nAs the cornfield's influence spreads, the surrounding neighborhood starts to change. Adults become distant and apathetic, while children grow increasingly hostile. Joshua, realizing the danger, tries to warn his adoptive parents, but they initially dismiss his concerns as the ramblings of a traumatized child.\n\nMeanwhile, Eli's influence over the children grows stronger. He convinces them to murder their parents, using the promise of a paradise within the cornfield. The murders are made to look like accidents or gang-related violence, allowing the cult to operate undetected.\n\nWilliam, a reporter for the local newspaper, begins to notice the strange happenings in his neighborhood. He starts investigating and discovers the truth about the cornfield and the cult. However, he is unable to convince his editor or the police of the danger.\n\nAs the body count rises, Joshua and William join forces to stop Eli and his cult. They discover that the only way to defeat the entity is to burn the cornfield. However, this proves challenging as the cornfield is guarded by Eli and his followers.\n\nIn the climactic showdown, William and Joshua manage to set the cornfield ablaze, despite Eli's best efforts to stop them. As the cornfield burns, the entity's hold over the children weakens, and they return to their senses. Eli, however, refuses to abandon his faith and is consumed by the flames.\n\nWith the entity defeated and the cult disbanded, life begins to return to normal in the neighborhood. Joshua, now free from his brother's influence, starts a new life with William and Amanda. The film ends with a chilling reminder that evil can take root anywhere, even in the heart of the urban jungle.\n\n\"Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest\" explores themes of faith, corruption, and the dangers of blind obedience. It uses the urban setting as a contrast to the rural setting of the previous films, highlighting that evil is not confined to isolated areas but can thrive in densely populated environments. The film also delves into the complex relationship between siblings, with Joshua's struggle to break free from Eli's influence serving as a central plot point. Overall, the film offers a chilling commentary on the power of belief and the potential for evil to flourish when left unchecked."

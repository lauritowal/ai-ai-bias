He has a close-knit family consisting of his loving parents and a younger brother, who is studying for his medical entrance examination. Prakash's life revolves around his family, his friends, and his prized possession - a Bajaj Pulsar motorbike.\n\nOne day, Prakash's bike is stolen from him, which leaves him devastated. He embarks on a mission to find his bike, which leads him to a group of small-time thieves. After a series of misadventures, Prakash manages to retrieve his bike, but he also accidentally stumbles upon a larger criminal network.\n\nThe bike had been stolen by a group of thieves who work for a powerful gangster named Selvam (Daniel Balaji).

The bike that Prakash had been so desperate to find was used to transport drugs, and now, Prakash is unknowingly caught in the middle of a dangerous game.\n\nAs Prakash continues to search for the truth, he is hunted by Selvam's men, who are after the bike and the drugs that were hidden in it. Prakash is forced to go into hiding, and he seeks the help of his friends and a local police officer, Inspector Pandian (Kishore), who is also investigating the case.\n\nAs the situation escalates, Prakash realizes that he is in way over his head. He is not just dealing with a group of petty thieves but with a dangerous criminal network that will stop at nothing to protect its secrets.

They demand that Prakash hand over the bike and the drugs in exchange for his brother's life. Prakash is faced with an impossible choice - give up the bike and the drugs, which could implicate him in the criminal network, or risk his brother's life.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to save his brother, Prakash teams up with Inspector Pandian and his friends to take down Selvam and his gang. They hatch a plan to capture Selvam and expose his criminal activities. However, things do not go as planned, and Prakash is captured by Selvam's men.\n\nSelvam tortures Prakash, demanding that he reveal the location of the bike and the drugs.

Prakash's brother is rescued, and the family is reunited.\n\nIn the aftermath of the events, Prakash reflects on the lessons he has learned.

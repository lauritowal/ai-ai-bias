        "\"Moneyball\" is a sports drama film released in 2011, directed by Bennett Miller and written by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. The movie is based on the 2003 non-fiction book \"Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game\" by Michael Lewis.\n\nThe film follows the true story of the Oakland Athletics' 2002 season, focusing on the team's General Manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt). Beane, a former baseball player himself, is tasked with rebuilding the team after losing key players to free agency. However, he faces a significant challenge: the Athletics have a limited budget compared to other teams in the league.\n\nBeane teams up with Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), a young and brilliant Yale economics graduate who has developed a unique approach to evaluating baseball players using advanced statistical analysis, known as sabermetrics. Together, they embark on a mission to assemble a competitive team despite the limited budget.\n\nBeane and Brand use their unorthodox approach to identify undervalued players who can make significant contributions to the team. They focus on players with high on-base percentages, which increases their chances of scoring runs. This approach goes against the traditional scouting methods used by other teams, which often rely on physical appearance, speed, and other intangible factors.\n\nAs the season progresses, Beane and Brand face resistance from the team's traditional scouts and coaches, who are skeptical of their new approach. However, the results on the field begin to prove the effectiveness of their strategy. The Athletics go on a remarkable winning streak, defying expectations and becoming a contender in the American League.\n\nThe film explores the tension between Beane's desire to innovate and the resistance from the traditional baseball establishment. It also delves into Beane's personal struggles, including his relationship with his daughter and his own failed baseball career.\n\n\"Moneyball\" is a gripping and thought-provoking film that showcases the intersection of sports, economics, and innovation. With outstanding performances from Pitt and Hill, the movie provides an engaging and inspiring look at the underdog story of the Oakland Athletics' 2002 season."

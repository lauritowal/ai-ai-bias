The movie marks the beginning of the \"Road\" series, a popular series of films featuring the comedic duo.\n\nJosh Mallon (Bing Crosby) and Ace Lannigan (Bob Hope) work as carnival entertainers, but their life takes a drastic turn when Josh's high-society fianc√©e, Gloria (Carolyn Lee) arrives, along with her disapproving father, who wants Josh to give up his carefree ways and settle down.\n\nIn an attempt to avoid Josh's impending marriage, Ace tricks him into fleeing to an island in the South Seas, where they become entangled with a beautiful and independent-minded woman, Mima (Dorothy Lamour).

Meanwhile, Ace and Mima grow closer, but their budding romance is complicated by cultural differences and the fact that Mima is promised to marry a prince.\n\nThroughout the film, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby engage in comedic banter, musical numbers, and witty one-liners.

        "I couldn't find any information on a movie titled \"King\" released in 2002. It's possible that the movie is lesser-known or a non-English film. If you could provide more context or details about the movie, I may be able to help you better.\n\nHowever, I found a 2017 Tamil-language film titled \"King\" but it was not released in 2002. If you are looking for information on a different movie, please provide more details, and I will try to assist you.\n\nIf you are referring to the 2002 Australian television movie \"King\", it's based on a true story of Graham 'Shirley' Marsh, an Australian boxer who rose to fame in the 1970s."

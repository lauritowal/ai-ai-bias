The movie features a group of young friends as they try to put on a stage show to raise funds.\n\nThe story begins with Alfalfa, the leader of the group, promising the gang that they will be the stars of a big show. As preparations begin, the children work hard to perfect their acts. However, their rehearsal is interrupted by Spanky, who is trying to sell tickets to the event. \n\nMeanwhile, a series of mishaps and accidents hinder their progress, including a wild goose chase with a loose animal backstage. As the day of the performance approaches, the gang must find a way to overcome their obstacles and put on a successful show.\n\nOn the night of the show, Alfalfa's opening number, 'I'm Looking Over a Four-Leaf Clover,' is met with laughter and applause from the audience. The rest of the gang also performs well, with Butch and Woim providing comedic relief. The show ends with a rousing finale, showcasing the children's talents.\n\nThroughout the film, the Our Gang series' signature blend of comedy and music is on display, making Our Gang Follies of 1938 a classic and entertaining addition to the series."

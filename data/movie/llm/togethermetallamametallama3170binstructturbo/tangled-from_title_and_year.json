        "\"Tangled\" is a 2010 American computer-animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. The film is loosely based on the classic fairy tale \"Rapunzel\" by the Brothers Grimm.\n\nThe story begins with the birth of a magical golden flower that blooms once a decade, which grants eternal youth and healing powers to whoever possesses it. The queen of the kingdom falls ill during her pregnancy, and the magical flower is used to heal her. However, the flower's magic is passed down to her unborn daughter, Rapunzel, whose hair becomes the source of the magical power.\n\nMother Gothel, an evil and manipulative woman, discovers the magical flower's secret and steals it, using its power to maintain her youth and beauty. However, when she learns that the magic has been transferred to Rapunzel's hair, she kidnaps the baby and raises her as her own daughter in a tall, isolated tower.\n\nRapunzel, now an 18-year-old with 70-foot-long golden hair, is kept captive in the tower by Mother Gothel, who uses her hair to maintain her own youth. Rapunzel is curious about the outside world, but Mother Gothel convinces her that the world is a dark and scary place, and that she is safer in the tower.\n\nOne day, a wanted thief named Flynn Rider (also known as Eugene Fitzherbert) stumbles upon the tower while on the run from the authorities. Rapunzel convinces Flynn to take her to the kingdom to see the floating lights that appear every year on her birthday, and in return, she promises to help him escape from the authorities.\n\nAs they embark on their journey, Rapunzel discovers the truth about her past and her royal heritage, while Flynn learns to confront his own demons and find redemption. Along the way, they face numerous obstacles, including the palace guards, a group of ruthless thugs, and Mother Gothel, who is determined to keep Rapunzel captive and maintain her own youth and power.\n\nThe film features a range of memorable characters, including Maximus, a horse with a sense of justice, and the Pub Thugs, a group of lovable and eccentric outcasts. The movie also features a range of catchy musical numbers, including \"When Will My Life Begin,\" \"Mother Knows Best,\" and \"I've Got a Dream.\"\n\nUltimately, Rapunzel and Flynn fall in love and work together to defeat Mother Gothel and reclaim Rapunzel's rightful place as the princess of the kingdom. The film ends with a heartwarming scene of Rapunzel and Flynn sharing a romantic kiss, surrounded by the floating lights that Rapunzel had always dreamed of seeing."

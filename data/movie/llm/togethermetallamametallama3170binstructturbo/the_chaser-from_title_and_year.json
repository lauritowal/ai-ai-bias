He becomes increasingly desperate and begins to suspect that a serial killer is targeting them. Jung-ho teams up with Mi-jin's young daughter and a few acquaintances to track down the killer.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, Jung-ho's past as a detective comes back to haunt him. He becomes obsessed with finding the killer and is forced to confront his own dark past.
